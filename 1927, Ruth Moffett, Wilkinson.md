+# The Obligatory Prayers

> Bahá’u’lláh gave two commands which we should fulfil as closely as we ease can: One is in regard to the Fast. As far as possible the Nineteen day Fast should be observed. That is a command not just a suggestion. It has a tremendous influence on others. (March 2nd - 20th inclusive) Second in regard to prayer, We know that Bahá’u’lláh grave us three obligatory Prayers: One a very long one to be observed with prostration bowings etc once in 24 hours, more especially adapted for the Oriental peoples. The second one is the medium length prayer, which is to be used at morning, noon and evening, and that has some of the bowing but not as much as the other. The third is the short prayer. This is to be observed every noon religiously between 12 and one o’clock; and that is especially adapted to our Western believers.  

I told Shoghi Effendi, it was very hard for me to think of it between 12 and one o’clock that I would think of it earlier and then forget. He said: That is one of the tests. The reason Bahá’u’lláh gave us obligatory prayers as a Command, is one of the tests for the believers.   

So if we think of it in that way, I think we will try harder to remember it just at the right hour, because BAHÁ’U’LLÁH ASKED US TO DO SO.   

Shogi Effendi said: In the day of the Báb, there was physical martyrdoms of the believers. We toast realise that we are being tested in ways that we have never been tested before. We must be wise. We must hold out our are welcoming these tests, knowing that tae are for us, that we may become stronger and able to meet the great ones and greater ones ahead of us, thereby becoming LIGHTBEARERS for those who are weak, and they will solely need our help, Remember the story of the Lightbearers:  

> God invited all humanity to a Feast, and when the time came for the guests to leave, He gave to each one a little saying, it will guide your steps on the way home. Someone said; It is bright moonlight, and threw the lamp aside. Some held their lamp so close to themselves, that it did not light one step ahead.

>   
A storm came up and many lights were blown out, only a few held their lamps high above their heads to give light to all around who were stumbling. Many missed their way completely and were hopelessly lost in the wilderness.

>   
Then God looting down in compassion sent his messenger to relight the lights that were blown out and guide the wandering ones. And then another day, and again many threw away their lamps. So when the night was come. God sent another Messenger to save them. But again they forgot when it was day. This happened again and again,. At last God knowing there was to be a long dark night, sent his best beloved Messenger (Baba’u’llah).

Baba’u’llah gave two commands which we should fulfill, as closely as we can. One is in regard to the Fast, as far as is possible; and that is a Command, not just a suggestion. As to the Fast, it has a tremendous influence upon others.   

Regarding the prayers: We know Baba’u’llah gave us three Obligatory Prayers: one very long one to be observed with prostrations, bowings, etc., three times a day, more especially adapted for the Oriental peoples. The second one is just a medium length prayer, which is to be used at evening; that has some of the bowings, but not so much. The third one is the very short prayer. This is to be observed every noon religiously, between 12 and 1 o’clock; and that is especially adapted to our Western believers.  

I told Shoghi Effendi it was hard for us to think of it between 12 and 1; that I would think of it at 11 o’clock and then forget it. He said “That is-one of the tests: The reason Baba’u’llah gave us obligatory prayers as a Command is one of the tests for the believers”. So, if we think of it in that way. I think we will try harder to remember it just at the right hour. Because Baba’u’llah asked us to do so.

Shoghi Effendi said. In the Day of the Báb there was physical martyrdom of the believers. In this Day it is the mental martyrdom of the believers. We must realize that. We must realize that we are being tested and will be increasingly tested in ways that we have never been tested before. We must be wise. We must hold out our arms welcoming those tests, knowing that they are for us, so that we may be stronger and able to meet the greater ones ahead of us, and thereby become Light Bearers for those who are weak, and they will surely need’ our help.

Remember the story: God invited all humanity to a feast; and when the time came for the guests to leave, He gave to each one a little lamp, saying: “It will guide your steps on the way home”. Some said, “It is bright moonlight, I will not need it”, and threw it aside. dome held their lamps so close to them that they did not light one step ahead. A storm came up, many lights were blown out. Only a few held their lamps high above their heads, to give light to all around who were stumbling. , Then God, looking down in compassion, sent His Messenger to relight the lamps. At last, God, knowing there was to be a long, dark night, sent His Rest Beloved Messenger, Baba’u’llah.

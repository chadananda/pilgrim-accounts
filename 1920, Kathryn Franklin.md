Of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in  
Haifa, Palestine,

### In Oct. 23, 1920

Dr. Luṭfu’lláh told me this morning that the English were going to build a prison on the site of the barracks in ‘Akká where Bahá’u’lláh and His followers were imprisoned for two years (This to be a prison for all Palestine)  

Where they were told of the imprisonment and after investigation, told the Bahá’ís that these rooms should not be touched but left as a sacred place for the believers all over the world to visit in future years.

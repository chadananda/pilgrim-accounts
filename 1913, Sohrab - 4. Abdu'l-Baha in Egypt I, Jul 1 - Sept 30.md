##  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt 

##  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT 

###  JULY 1, 1913 

###  1. To Look Back and survey the Activities of the Month 

I believe it {{p1}} would be a good practice if, on the first of
every month, we would survey the collective activities of
the days just past, to see whether we have accomplished
anything either beneficial or harmful to our fellow men;
if we find the former, we should make these actions stepping-stones
for greater things; if the latter, we should try
to turn into the right pathway. For those who have just
accepted the Bahá’í Revelation there is nothing more useful
than retrospection. In this day the Highway of the
Lord of Mankind is plain. Many of the past obstacles are
removed, and the hollow places and marshy grounds are
filled. If we start walking in His path we shall surely
reach our destination, behold the Countenance of the Beloved,
receive His benediction and ever afterward commune
with the Holy Ones.   

###  2. The Bahá’í Path and Its Pilgrims 

The Bahá’í path is one which leads us to the Kingdom
of Eternity. {{p2}} God has illumined it with the Light of His
face. Hundreds and thousands are joining those who
have begun their pilgrimage upon the Highway of Abhá.
As they go along they raise their clarion voices in thankfulness
and praise. They sing the songs of Peace and
Spiritual brotherhood. They know that theirs is the
victory of attainment. What a happy band of pilgrims
they are! Their faith is superhuman, their energy extraordinary,
their faces illumined, their feet untiring,
their conviction contagious, their love unselfish, their hope
transcendent, their sincerity unquestioned, their integrity
unimpeachable and their devotion to the Cause attested!
My friends! let us join this holy band of pilgrims!   

Last night ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told me to come to him in the
morning with a number of petitions just received; so I
was there quite early. While He was dictating Tablets
he carried on different lines of conversations with a
stream of callers and pilgrims. Tablets were revealed
for a large number of friends in Europe and America,
and a wonderful article for the “Theosophy” of Scotland
in Edinburgh, the Editor of which is Mr. Graham Pole.   

###  3. Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the “Theosophy” in Scotland
in Regard to Divine Civilization and Man’s Illumination 

TO THE SECRETARY OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY
AND THE EDITOR OF SCOTLAND THEOSOPHY,
EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND.   

“He is God!   

O Thou BELOVED AND RESPECTED FRIEND: —   

“Your letter written to Áqá Mírzá Aḥmad was received.
I likewise read it. Its contents imparted happiness,
for it was an indication of the magnanimity of
your effort and of your philanthropic intention. {{p3}} The
Articles which you have published in the Theosophical
magazine bear testimony to your lofty aim.   

“A wise and sagacious writer pens such articles — the
results of which are eternal, and its benefits universal;
thus the world of humanity may advance toward the kingdom
of Mercifulness and divine susceptibilities may shine
and gleam like unto radiant lamps from the reality
of man.   

“Today humanity is in need of heavenly teachings,
which are the spirit of this age and the light of this
cycle. Material, physical civilization has made extraordinary
progress, but Divine Civilization is totally forgotten.
In truth, Divine Civilization is like unto the light, whereas
material civilization is similar to the glass. The glass
without the light will be dark.   

“Therefore, great effort must be made so that the
heavenly lamp may become ignited, the world of morality
illumined and the inexhaustible virtues which are the decorations
of the reality of mankind revealed as glowing
stars.   

“The world of nature is the arena of the animal kingdom.
Look thou upon any one of the animals and thou
will realize that the virtues of the world of nature are
fully manifest in it with the utmost perfection — to an extent
that it would be impossible for man to attain. Consider
thou a sweet singing bird, beautiful and harmonious,
that builds its nest on the topmost branch of a tree
growing on the slope of a mountain! In reality this
nest is preferable to the palace of the king. The weather
is of the utmost delicacy, the panorama indeed entrancing,
the water most salubrious, the mountains green and verdant,
and the harvest in the valley and on the plain is the
wealth of the bird! It has no trouble, no hardship, no
thought, no scheme, no sorrow, no grief, no remorse and
no regret. {{p4}} Day and night this bird lives with the utmost
joy and happiness in its own royal nest! It becomes
evident that the virtues of the world of nature are most
complete in the animal kingdom.   

“But look at the condition of the poor man! Now he
is exiled, again he is sick, then helpless or perhaps a
prisoner, now he is afflicted with poverty and penury,
and then thrown amid dangers. Day and night he is
striving, so that he may gain his livelihood through toil
and turmoil. With your own reason compare the difference
between the life of man and that of the animal!
These things demonstrate that the virtues of the world
of nature are more apparent in the animal kingdom.   

“On the other hand, although man does not seem to
enjoy a complete share or inexhaustible portion of these
natural bounties, he is, in the Divine World, the center of
infinite Bestowals, the lamp of the light of Reality, the
shining mirror of the Beauty of God, the manifestor of
human perfection, the dawning place of celestial
rays and the possessor of the “holy power” which penetrates
into and surrounds the essence of all phenomena.   

“Man discovers the reality of things, and governing
the world of nature, brings its secrets out of the world of
the invisible into the realm of existence. Now, like a
bird, he soars through the air and again he swims on the
surface of the ocean; he travels hither and thither, then
dives under the sea with great power. Thus he causes the
revelation of all the laws of nature out of the unseen into
the seen realm.   

“For this reason, he is endowed with a higher power to
make use of this knowledge to benefit the world and stimulate
its progress. This “power” is reserved for man, and
by it he is distinguished from the animal.   

“Inasmuch as man is endowed with such a power, he
must become the manifestation of divine civilization, the
dawning-place of the light of reality, the founder of
heavenly perfections, the spreader of spiritual teachings
and the servant of the world of morality. {{p5}} He must rejoice
the spirits through the Divine Glad-tidings, free
them from discouragement and grant them the hope of
Everlasting life.   

“This is the excellence and glory of the human world!
This is the Everlasting Prosperity.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

###  4. Article in the “Egyptian Gazette” about Bahá’í
Pilgrims 

An article published in the Egyptian Gazette, dated
Friday, June 27th, on page three, entitled: —   

“‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ IN EGYPT.
WONDERFUL SCENES IN PORT SA‘ÍD.
EASTERN BAHÁ’ÍS ASSEMBLED IN FORCE.”   

The description of the Persian believers “who are
curiously dressed in great lambskin hats and long divided
skirts with enormous pleats” was specially graphic. Here
is a quotation giving another sidelight of the manner in
which these “Converts” lived: —   

“At Port Sa‘íd the pilgrims have erected a huge tent
on the roof of a native hotel and there they gather and
sing with touching devotion.”   

###  5. Home of Bahá’u’lláh and Its Keeper 

Mírzá Núru’lláh Vakíl is an old believer from Ba<u>gh</u>dád.
He has been in Haifa and Alexandria for ten months
awaiting the arrival of the Beloved. He is a patient, true
Bahá’í, ever ready to fulfill the desire of the Lord. He
is the keeper of the House in which Bahá’u’lláh and his
family lived for eleven years. {{p6}} This house, owing to lack
of attention, has fallen into ruin, and for the present
there are no means at hand to either rebuild or to repair it.
In speaking with him upon this matter he said that with a
sum of 500 pounds sterling the house could be suitably
repaired. The above answer was given through my own
solicitation; but I believe it would cost at least 1,000
pounds sterling to reconstruct the house upon its old plan
without any architectural innovation, thus keeping the
original form of the time of Bahá’u’lláh. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
spoke to Mírzá Núru’lláh and to a number of Bahá’ís
from Ba<u>gh</u>dád. He made it plain that he has great love
for the believers of Ba<u>gh</u>dád, and that they are ever in his
heart. Let them not be sad owing to the present ruin of
the house. The time for its building will come very soon.
It may have to be destroyed and rebuilt but its first form
must not undergo any change. Let them rest assured
that it will be constructed most solidly. This is a Blessed
House; do they not realize it was the home of Bahá’u’lláh?
All that quarter in which the House is situated
will be destroyed and then transformed into wonderful
Parks and gardens. It will become most heavenly. The
Holy Sepulcher of Christ was for three hundred years a
place for dumping all kinds of rubbish, then St. Helena
came, cleared the ground and built over it a most wonderful
church. However, these times are different, and the
Places wherein the Blessed Perfection has lived will be
fully preserved.   

Today two pilgrims arrived, Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh, the son
of the oldest brother of Bahá’u’lláh from Persia, and a
young Bahá’í from Damascus.   

Upon hearing of the arrival of the son of his uncle,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá called him into his presence and showered
much love upon him. I was not there to witness the scene
and to hear his words. But ‘Alí-Akbar told me that the
Master spoke about his childhood days. {{p7}} Things that I
should like to have heard.   

###  6. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Talk to the Pilgrims on the Evidences of
the Cause 

In the afternoon we were all invited to the Master’s
house for tea. We waited a few moments downstairs,
and as soon as we heard his footsteps everybody arose.
He sat on a chair in front of the window and spoke
feelingly.   

He stated that the majority of the inhabitants of Persia
are yet asleep, although God has demonstrated His Cause
to them in so many ways.... If this Cause had appeared
in Europe or America, those regions would by this
time have become illumined and countless souls awakened.
So many were martyred in Persia, so much blood has
been spilt! If one of these events had transpired in another
country, the effect would have been marvelous!
Nevertheless there were many people in Persia who became
illumined and celestial, and cried out in order to
awaken their fellow men!... An infinite number of
these believers of God have been examples of severance,
incarnations of devotion, and flaming candles; they have
embodied in the world of humanity the Teachings of God,
and have become demonstrations, showing how man could
be pure, sanctified, attracted, enkindled and honest! The
evidences of God they wrote with their own blood upon
the earth.   

Then he went out to take a walk, telling us to follow
him. As the “Greatest Holy Leaf” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sister)
will arrive from Haifa to be with the Master, and
as the present house is small and rather unfurnished,
another apartment consisting of four rooms and a kitchen
is rented for us. “Us” means Mírzá Maḥmúd, Siyyid
Asadu’lláh, Mírzá Munír and Aḥmad Sohrab. {{p8}} The
Master therefore walked to this apartment to see if it was
ready. On the way he told us two stories of his childhood,
one about the Muḥammadan clergy and the “big
paradise,” another about a bare-headed Mullá before a
large crowd of people, the sudden shower of hail upon
his head and his precipitated flight.   

###  7. Experiences of a Pilgrim and How He was Robbed
on the Way 

Coming out of the apartment ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ordered a
carriage and with Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh they were driven away.
We returned to the hotel and had an interesting conversation
with a young Bahá’í from Damascus. Having been
in Ṭihrán during the Parliamentary period, he gave us a
thrilling account of the victory of the Nationalist Cause,
and of his journey from Ṭihrán toward <u>Sh</u>íráz, and how
a large Caravan which included himself was attacked and
robbed. He and his friend had to walk six days through
mountains and uninhabited places, bedraggled and with
large blisters on the soles of their feet before they reached
their destination. Although he had suffered much, yet
he was very cheerful and happy because today he was
privileged to look upon the face of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá — the lover
of humanity.

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 2, 1913. 

###  1. Talk of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on spiritual Cultivation and
Teaching 

Toward the end of a wonderful talk given this afternoon
to the Persian Pilgrims, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated that it
was not his duty to command particular persons to teach
the Cause. Whosoever arises to spread the Word and to
perform this service, will behold the Doors of Confirmation
open wide before his face. This is the time for
teaching and therefore results will be achieved. In every
season a particular service will be productive. If, during
the seed-sowing time we want to gather the harvest we
shall be unsuccessful, if at the period of irrigation we
desire to do something else, failure will be the result.
Now this is the divine season of seed-sowing. Every
Bahá’í must become a heavenly Cultivator, or at the appointed
hour the prayers of all the past and future ages,
will yield no fruit. In his long trip throughout Europe
and America ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s primal object was to show the
friends of God by deeds that now is the hour for teaching
the Cause. Although ‘Akká and Haifa are the headquarters
of this movement and he had many reasons to
stay there, and from that center administer the affairs
of the Cause, yet, he left everything and traveled throughout
the earth to herald the coming of the Kingdom of
Abhá. Any person desiring to be surrounded by the
Confirmations of the Blessed Perfection, must arise and
teach the Cause. This is the path.   

###  2. Departure of the Pilgrims, and Remarks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
on Music 

Seven more pilgrims left for Haifa and Alexandria.
Except one Zoroastrian who will depart for Bombay
on the 5th, no one is left of the large number of
pilgrims. {{p10}} Today two fine young Bahá’í students arrived
from Beirut. They are the advance guard of the
rest of the students who will be here soon. These two
are very polite and speak English fluently. One of them
is the son of Muḥammad Taqí Iṣfaháni of Cairo his
name is ‘Abdu’l-Ḥusayn. He has a fine voice and chants
the Bahá’í Communes most effectively. He chanted tonight
for the Beloved who was very pleased with him.   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá wishes the believers to cultivate their voices
so that they may sing the Bahá’í songs and chant with
effect the Prayers of the Blessed Perfection; for Prayer
is the food of the spirit.   

###  3. Quiet Association with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

In the evening, at the end of a long walk, the Master
came to our hotel. He walked down the veranda where
I was sitting alone, opened the door and entered one of
the rooms. Little by little the friends gathered around
him. Down in the street a motley crowd of Arabs were
passing along; above our heads, the stars shone with utmost
brilliancy, while at our left the Mediterranean lay
smiling. We were all very happy in the Presence of the
Master of Illumination. In the darkness his face irradiated
like an orb of light, and his tongue uttered such
words of guidance and truth as the “Man of Sorrows”
spoke 1900 years ago on Mount Olivet.   

###  4. Progress of the Bahá’í Cause in Germany and
Letters from That Country 

In the morning we drank tea in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence.
He sent for us very early. It seemed that he had slept
last night in Aḥmad Yazdí’s apartment, so we all went
there. {{p11}} After our arrival he spoke about the progress of
the Cause in Germany. He had some letters from Mírzá
‘Alí-Akbar and Mírzá Luṭfu’lláh Ḥakím giving the description
of the meetings in Stuttgart during their one
week’s stay there. He read the former aloud, and gave
me the latter to read to the friends.   

There were also letters from the German friends and
these he gave me to translate and send to the Star of the
West, for publication, which was done on the same day.
Then he spoke very enthusiastically about the German
believers, their firmness, and their devotion. For more
than one hour he talked about Bahá’u’lláh and about the
enemies of the Cause, who had at every turn tried to
stop its influence, but who had all failed. And he also
related several historical incidents of the early days of
Ba<u>gh</u>dád.   

###  5. Appearance of Truth 

In concluding his remarks he told us that along with
the appearance of Truth, the point of opposition raises
its head. The former gains signal victory, the other goes
into crushing defeat; the first upraises the standard of
guidance, the other unfurls the banner of error; one is
divine revelation, another is satanic suggestion; the first
leads us into the paradise of Peace, the second hurls us
headlong into the hell of war.   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 3, 1913. 

###  1. The Bahá’í Cause Is in Need of Earnest Workers
Who Will Defy All Opposition 

We are living in the days in which the Spirit of the
Lord is manifest, and the rays of the Sun of Reality
evident. The divine Jerusalem has descended from heaven
and the Glorious Glad-tidings are proclaimed. We must
fashion our lives according to the heavenly teachings,
live in a state of internal contentment, peruse the Holy
Writings and practice that which will be conducive to
our own and to the world’s prosperity. The Bahá’í Cause
is much in need of real, earnest workers — workers who
will defy all opposition, meeting their antagonists with
smiling faces and standing as firm rocks before the blowing
of the winds of tests and of the storms of trials.
How many old trees are uprooted by one wind and how
many ships have been wrecked by one storm! There are
many lands athirst for the water of life, let the friends
of God irrigate them with vernal showers from the Kingdom
of Abhá. There are many persons hungry for the
heavenly bread, we must invite them to the Banquet
of the Lord. The lethargic must become active, the sleepy
awakened; the deprived must receive a share of the inexhaustible
Favors, and the sweet music of the Supreme
Concourse must be heard. We should be up and doing
some kind of service no matter how slight it is. Praise
be to God that the orb of the Center of Covenant is shining
and that His Mercy is all-encompassing. He is teaching
and gently and lovingly guiding us in the Right Path.
We all desire to serve him in some way and win his
good pleasure by sincerely walking in his footsteps; {{p13}} we
hope to become the signs of his compassion and the humble
followers of his eternal law!   

###  2. Life in Port Sa‘íd, and Fleas But No Mosquitoes 

All this morning and part of the afternoon we were
left to ourselves. The Master was busy in other directions
and could not call us to his presence. Meanwhile we found
time to pack our trunks and move from the hotel
into our new apartment. It is unfurnished but as
we do not know how long we will stay in Port Sa‘íd,
it is not necessary to purchase many things. I have one
large black kitchen table on which I do my writing, a
chair and a bed. The apartment is airy and has a wonderful
side view of the Mediterranean. It is in the Arab
quarter and rented for nine dollars a month. Port Sa‘íd
is famous for its fleas. They bother us to death all night.
Those who have mosquito nets escape the attacks of the
fleas and sleep comfortably, but I happen not to have any
and have to carry on an offensive and defensive war with
the swarming army. Several years ago when I lived here,
there were many mosquitoes — not as bad as New Jersey
ones — but quite ferocious. However, the Egyptian
Government organized a Sanitary Commission who undertook
the filling of the marshy grounds and thus exterminated
the breeding of mosquitoes. During the spring
and summer there is not a drop of rain. All that we see is
an occasional patch of cloud aimlessly rambling in the
sky. Our apartment being very near the Mediterranean,
we enjoy a fresh, vitalizing breeze all the time, especially
in the evenings. {{p14}} Many people sleep on the roofs which
are flat and paved like the floor of a room.   

###  3. Ḥusayn Rúḥí and His Bahá’í School in Cairo 

About 5 o’clock <u>Kh</u>usraw, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s attendant,
brought the good news that we were called by the Master
to the new house. The believers with others just arrived
from Cairo, were already assembled when we entered.
Ḥusayn Rúḥí who years ago was in America with <u>Kh</u>urasání,
was present with his three sons. He is a short
man and knows English and Arabic very well. He keeps
a private school in Egypt, the pupils numbering about a
hundred and sixty children; the majority being orphans.
The school is named “‘Abbás” and the master’s photograph
is hung in a prominent place in every classroom.
Ḥusayn Rúḥí is an active young man, and I believe
that he is doing much good.   

###  4. Palace of Bahá’u’lláh in Núr, Persia 

The Master had asked Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh — the son of
his great uncle — to draw the design of the house of Bahá’u’lláh
in Núr. Therefore, he, with the assistance of Mírzá
‘Alí-Akbar, was busy all day making this plan which was
completed this afternoon. It must have been a palatial
residence according to the architectural conception of
the East. The Master, holding the various papers in his
hands, described the different parts of the house as though
he had left it yesterday. Then with his matchless power,
he contrasted this palace of luxury and worldly comfort
with the barren and ruined barrack of ‘Akká.   

###  5. Talk of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on His and Bahá’u’lláh’s
Imprisonment in the Prison of ‘Akká, and
on Real Happiness 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke on happiness, saying that the soul
of man must be happy, no matter where he is. {{p15}} He must
attain to that condition of inward beatitude and peace,
where outward circumstances can not alter his spiritual
calm and joyousness. No one can imagine a worse place
than the barracks of ‘Akká. The climate was bad, the water
no better, the surroundings filthy and dirty, and the deportment
of the officials unbearable, while he and his
family were looked upon as enemies of religion and destroyers
of morals. The Government had given orders
that no one should address them during their stay in
‘Akká and that they should not be allowed to converse
with each other.   

Upon their arrival, the officials found that there were
not enough rooms in the barracks to imprison them separately,
so all were put into two bare rooms. The court
had a most gloomy aspect. It contained three or four
fig trees, in the branches of which several ominous owls
screeched all night. Everyone became ill and there were
neither provisions nor medicines.   

At the entrance to the barrack there was an undertaker’s
room. It was a horrible looking place, yet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
lived there for two years with the utmost happiness.
Up to that period he had had no opportunity to read
the Qur’án from cover to cover, but here he found ample
time and used to study this Holy Book with fervor and
enthusiasm, going over the incidents and events of the
lives of former prophets and finding how parallel they
were with the events of these latter days. Thus he was
consoled and encouraged. He would read, for instance,
the following verse:   

“How thoughtless are the people! Whenever a
prophet is sent unto them they either ridicule him or persecute
him.”   

And then he read this verse:   

“Verily our host is victorious over them.”   

He was very happy, because he was a free man. {{p16}} Shut
off in that room his spirit traveled throughout the immensity
of space. At night he went up on the roof and
communed with the countless brilliant stars. What a
divine feast! What a heavenly procession! What spiritual
freedom! What beatific bliss! What celestial Sovereignty!   

###  6. Remarks on War Waged between Greece and
Bulgaria 

Then he spoke in detail about the present war between
Greece and Bulgaria, and the utter folly of shedding the
blood of innocent people. There is no benefit in this
human butchery, this spoilation, this destruction! Mankind
must learn the lesson of Peace; they must be instructed
in the school of love. What is this insanity?
What is this fratricide? What is this ruthlessness? Away
with the nightmare of war! Banish the thought of strife
and sedition! Are we not brothers? Are we not the sheep
of one shepherd? How long shall this blindness continue;
how long this military lunacy? Then he spoke about the
restlessness of kings and rulers and gave us the instance
of one Muḥammadan Caliph who, although he had many
countries under his dominion, yet could not be happy.   

Divine happiness, he said, is obtained through servitude
at the Threshold of God, through evanescence, detachment,
sincerity and severance from all else save Him.   

###  7. Story about Bahá’u’lláh’s Shepherd 

Before he left us he recalled to his mind the name of
the head-shepherd of Bahá’u’lláh and related many stories
about him. {{p17}} He asked Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh whether he were
still alive and received the answer: “He is dead, but his
daughter is living.”   

One day this head-shepherd came to the Blessed Perfection
and said: “My Lord! I have one piece of advice
to give unto you.”   

“What is it?” Bahá’u’lláh asked.   

“Never trust the ‘Ulamás.”   

Bahá’u’lláh loved this man because of his simplicity
and faithfulness. We were then given permission to
retire.   

###  8. A Joke with Ḥusayn Rúḥí 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked Ḥusayn Rúḥí how many pupils
he had in his school. “One hundred and sixty.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said laughingly that Ḥusayn Rúḥí was rich and
that his hands were certainly full! He himself did not
have one pupil. Could Ḥusayn Rúḥí find some students
for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá?   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 4, 1913. 

###  1. Story of Ḥájí ‘Abdu’lláh and His Conversation
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

Ḥájí ‘Abdu’lláh is a Bahá’í of eighty years of age. He
has lived fifty years in Egypt and has ever been a devoted
Bahá’í; and a sincere believer. He is dressed in Eastern
robes and has a long gray beard. {{p18}} Although advanced in
age, he is vigorous and in good health. He has seen
Egypt become most prosperous through the opening
of the Suez Canal. He lives in one of the small towns in
the interior of the country and having heard about the
arrival of the Master has come to see him. Today he
received permission to return to his work. He had a
conversation with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked him how old he was.   

He said he was over eighty years old.   

Well! He had lived a good long life and now he
looked younger than ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!   

It was through the Favor of Bahá’u’lláh, voiced the old
veteran.   

It was true! ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told him, and wished to
know whether he desired to live much longer.   

Ḥájí ‘Abdu’lláh gave an affirmative answer.   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was surprised.   

What? Was this life so sweet to the old man’s taste
for him to long for an extension of it? Why was this?
As to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá he was ready to leave this ephemeral
world. It contained no attraction for him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
likened himself to a man who has heard that he must
travel twenty days before reaching his destination. Having
traveled already fifteen days, he is eager to hasten
his trip and arrive at his goal. He is anticipating the
eternal union with the Beloved at the end of his journey;
therefore he is impatient!   

The old man was deeply moved and spoke in a tremulous
voice. He did not want to live for himself.
Looking back at the map of his life, he saw many barren
years stretching before his eyes, for he had not been confirmed
in the service of the Cause. Therefore he desired
to do something. He was hoping against hope that he
might yet be enabled to render a great service to the
Cause. {{p19}} He knew that he was very old, but his hope was
young, and his eyes were filled with tears.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Dictates Tablets for Many Bahá’ís. 

This morning the Master received in private many of
the Egyptian friends who had just arrived to meet him
for one day. Meanwhile he found time to dictate Tablets
to many of the friends in America and England and an
important one to the International Congress of Free
Christians, and other Religious Liberals, holding its Congress
in Paris from July 16th to 22nd. Let me share with
you the contents of the last.   

###  3. Tablet to the International Congress of Free
Christians 

TO THE SECRETARY OF THE SIXTH INTERNATIONAL
CONGRESS OF FREE AND PROGRESSIVE CHRISTIANS,
AND OTHER RELIGIOUS LIBERALS, HELD IN PARIS,
FRANCE, JULY, 1913. 

“He is God   

BELOVED AND RESPECTED FRIEND: —   

“Your letter was received. Its contents became conducive
to happiness of conscience, for it indicated that
a group of the well-wishers of the world of humanity
have displayed an effort to bring about a Congress of
Religions, so that this may become the means of establishing
affiliation among those religions, in order that
the reality and the foundation of the Divine Religion be
disclosed, and the causes of misunderstandings be removed. {{p20}} This is indeed an exalted intention; it is a service
to the world of humanity and is conducive to the unveiling
of merciful susceptibilities.   

“I hope that that Congress may be confirmed in affiliating
the hearts of the people of the world, and be the
means of the creation of peace between religions, so that
the darkness of estrangement may be dispelled from
amongst mankind and the followers of all religions may
be ushered into the world of Unity — that is, accept the
principles of the Oneness of the word of humanity.   

“It has been my greatest longing to be present at that
International Gathering, but now I live in Egypt, my
physical constitution is weakened, and other infirmities of
age prevent me from attending the Congress. Therefore,
begging your pardon for this shortcoming, I write a few
lines on this subject: —   

“It is well known and evident to the wise men of
humanity — the wooers of Truth — that the aim of the appearance
of the Holy Divine Manifestations, the revelation
of the Book and the establishment of the Spiritual
Religion, has been no other than to create affinity amongst
the children of men, and to found the law of Love between
the individuals of the world of humanity. Religion
is the basis of spiritual Unity; it is the oneness of
thoughts; the oneness of susceptibilities; the oneness of
morality; and the necessary connection between all the
people of the world — so that minds and souls may grow
and develop through divine Education, in order that they
may investigate reality, ascend to the lofty heights of
human perfection and found on this terrestrial globe a
Divine Civilization.   

“In the world of existence there are two kinds of
Civilizations: a natural and material civilization which
serves the physical world; and a divine and heavenly
civilization which renders service to the world of morality.
The founders of natural civilization are the scientists
and philosophers of the earth. {{p21}} The establishers
of divine civilization are the celestial Manifestations
of God. Religion is the basis of Divine Civilization.
Natural civilization is like unto the body. Divine
Civilization is like unto the spirit. A Body without
spirit is dead, although it may be in the utmost beauty
and comeliness. In short, by religion we mean those
necessary bonds which unify the world of humanity.
This has ever been the bestowal of God. This is the
object of Divine teaching and law. This is the light
of everlasting life. But alas, a thousand times alas! for
this solid foundation is abandoned and forgotten; the
leaders of religion have fabricated a set of blind dogmas
and rituals which are at complete variance with the foundation
of divine religion. As these dogmas differ from
each other, they cause differences; differences breed
strife, and strife ends in war and bloodshed; the blood
of innocent people is spilled, their possessions are ransacked
and pillaged and their children become captives
and orphans. Thus religion, which was designed to become
the cause of friendship, has become the cause of
enmity. Religion, which was meant to be sweet honey,
is changed into bitter poison. Religion, whose function
was to be the illumination of the world of humanity, has
become the factory of obscurantism and gloom. Religion
which was meant to confer everlasting life, has become
the fiendish instrument of death. Consequently, as long
as these blind dogmas are in human hands, and these
nets of dissimulation and hypocrisy in their fingers,
religion will be but a harmful agency in the world of
humanity. Hence these superannuated and tattered dogmas
which are current among present day religions
must be totally abolished, and, thus, freed from past
traditions, mankind will be able to investigate the real
objects of divine religion; {{p22}} for inasmuch as the foundation
of the religion of God is One, and that One is
absolute reality, and reality is indivisible and not amenable
to multiplicity, therefore complete unity and amity
between all religions shall be instituted and the true
religion of God shall become unveiled with the utmost
beauty and sublimity in the assemblage of the world of
humanity.   

“Thence, it is the duty of this honorable Congress
to rend asunder these veils of imitations, to remove
these non-essentials and to disperse these dark clouds
that the Sun of Truth may dawn from the Everlasting
Horizon with the utmost brilliancy.   

“Praise be to God, that this century is the century of
success! This Cycle is the Cycle of Reality! Minds
have developed, thoughts have taken a wider range of
vision; intellects have become keen; emotions are
sensitized; inventions have transformed the face of the
earth and this age has acquired a glorious capacity for
the majestic revelation of the oneness of the world of
humanity.   

“Should this honorable Congress display an extraordinary
effort in the promotion of altruistic aims, and
remove these dogmas which are in the hands of the
religionists — such dogmas as are in opposition to the
Divine Ideals — this world will become another world,
the physical earth will be changed into the universe of
the Kingdom, the world of humanity will become an
arena for the revealing of the mysteries of Truth; the
rays of the Sun of the Divine Firmament will shine
upon it; East and West will become illumined; North
and South will embrace each other like unto two beloved
ones; {{p23}} the followers of all the religions will become
investigators and champions of Reality, new
eternal Institutes will be founded in the human world
and the Palace of the oneness of the realm of humanity
raised higher and higher, day by day.   

“These are the hopes of this Wanderer. I beg of
God confirmation and assistance for you, — so that you
may be inspired with such a spiritual vision: the appearance
of which is looked upon as impossible and
unrealizable from the very foundation of the world;
but which in this glorious Cycle will become manifest
in the utmost beauty and perfection.   

“Upon you be greeting and praise.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

------

Although at this time the Master was not feeling well
he continued to dictate Tablets and when he was thus
occupied, he entered into a spiritual state, and his bodily
weariness completely disappeared, and for the time his
health was absolutely restored.   

For the last few days he has been complaining about
the weather and he may shortly leave for Ismailia,
which is the summer resort of Egypt. The Port Sa‘íd
weather at this season is most humid. I don’t think he
will keep all of us with him, but he may take one or
two; probably Mírzá Munír. In the afternoon, while
the believers were sitting in his presence, he dictated
many Tablets and they listened most carefully. To
them, this is more significant than a talk, because they
consider it the greatest privilege of their lives to be present
while the holy Tablets are revealed. After an hour
or so he said it was enough, and for nearly thirty
minutes he related many stories about the futility of
studying Muḥammadan theology which is nothing more
than traditions and prejudiced dogmas.   

###  4. Poem by Mr. Chase Read to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

The poem of Mr. Chase written on August 9, 1912,
San Francisco, California, was read to the Master and
he gave his permission to publish it in the Star of the
West. {{p24}} It was composed just before his death, begging
the Beloved to go to California. The first line of it is: —   

“O Thou David of the Promised Kingdom of God.”   

###  5. Story about Abraham’s Hospitality 

Another interesting story about Abraham was sent
from Francisco by Miss Bijou Straun who is preparing
a book of the Master’s addresses for publication. She
desires to include this story as a footnote. It was read
to the Master. He gave the source whence the story
came. First I will copy here the story as reported in
M. K. Schermerhorn’s book, and then I will give the
version as the Beloved told it:   

“Abraham would scarce break His Fast for one week,
lest some hungry traveler should pass who might need
his store. Ever he looked out upon the desert, and one
day he beheld an aged man, with hair white as snow,
tottering toward his door. ‘Guest of mine eyes!’ exclaimed
Abraham, ‘enter thou with welcome, and be
pleased to share my bread and salt!’ The stranger complied
and the place of honor was given to him. When
the family gathered round the board, each one of them
said: ‘In the name of God!’ — but the aged guest uttered
no word. Abraham said: ‘Good man! when thou eatest
food, is it not right to repeat the name of God?’ {{p25}} The
stranger replied, ‘My custom is that of the Fire Worshipers!’
Then Abraham arose in wrath, and drove the
aged man from his house, but even as he did so, a swift-winged
Spirit stood before the patriarch and said: — ‘Abraham, for a hundred years hath the divine bounty
flowed out to this man in sunshine and rain, in bread and
life. Is it fit for thee to withhold thy hand from him,
because his worship is not thine?’”   

According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, this story is recorded in the
Ma<u>th</u>naví. It is related that an aged and decrepit man
visited His Holiness Abraham, and was received with
the utmost hospitality and courtesy. When dinner was
served, His Holiness Abraham uttered the name of God
and then began to eat. His guest, on the other hand,
pronounced the name of an idol and also began to eat.
His Holiness was grieved, and arose in wrath rebuking
his guest most severely; but even as he did so, God’s
revelation descended upon him: —   

>  “O Abraham! For a hundred years this man has been
an idol worshiper and I have been patient with him; I
have nurtured him; I have protected him; I have taken
care of him; I have trained him; I have showed him
with many bounties and have been kind and loving to
him; but thou wert not able to endure his society even
for one night!” 

His Holiness Abraham was deeply touched by this
address and begged his aged guest to pardon him.   

When we left the Master’s presence he kept Mírzá
Faḍl’u’lláh and later on, as they were walking together
in the avenue, the Editor of “Peesah Akbar,” an important
Indian newspaper, met him. This journalist happens
to know a great deal about the Cause through the
American press notices which were sent to him by Mírzá
Maḥmúd who met him while traveling and teaching in
India. {{p26}} He has already written several articles about the
Cause in his own journal.   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 5, 1913. 

###  1. World Conflict and Its Remedy 

Whether we live in the East or in the West, the invisible
Power of God is unifying our scattered forces,
and training us for the service of His Kingdom — the
Kingdom of Universal Love and interracial Amity.
Today, more than at any other time, the world of humanity
is in need of this Power. The keen competition
which is carried on by the captains of industry and
finance, the rumbling discontent and social unrest of the
laboring class, the bigotry and fanaticism of some of the
religions, the heat and bitterness with which fanatic controversies
are upheld between the sectarians, the spirit
of superiority with which some nations look upon others,
the lust of conquest, and the desire for the extension of
territory, the social and political rivalries between nations
and governments and the hatred and enmity existing between
antagonistic races — all these forces clashing
against each other, apparently aggravate the situation
and make confusion more confounded. But the Power
of the spiritual conscience has come to stay, bringing
healing under its wide-outstretched wings. {{p27}} ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
believes that this power alone is the solvent for all these
puzzling problems. Here and there may be found some
medicine to give temporary relief, but the lasting and
permanent cure is the spiritual Power of Love which
unites all people and sets at naught their seeming differences.
This Power alone transforms hearts, inspires
spirits, uplifts minds, reveals the secrets of Truth and
unfurls the Banner of divine brotherhood.   

###  2. The departure of a Zoroastrian Bahá’í for Bombay,
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet about His Western Trip. 

Our last pilgrim, the Zoroastrian from Bombay — Mehreban — has left today for his home. He was an old man
with a bushy round, gray beard. He spoke very little, but
his eyes were fresh springs of love and gentleness. The
Master has been especially kind to him and often praised
his race for their uprightness and charity. He called
him, this morning, to his presence, and after a few words
of farewell, gave him a short Tablet written with his own
hand, the translation of which is as follows:   

“O thou Mehreban! Praise be to God that through the
Protection and Favor of the Omnipotent God thou didst
reach the Illumined spot, have kissed the Threshold of the
Kind Friend, and have become confirmed and assisted in
that which is the highest desire of the angels of the Universe
of heaven. Now thou hast for several days been
my associate and my companion, therefore return to
India and convey the greeting of this Friend to each and
all the believers and say: —   

“‘This indigent one does not enjoy one moment of
peace. In the evening he is restless, by day he is full of
acclamation. He undertook the long trip to Europe and
America and cried out over the mountains and on the
plains. Now the time has come when the friends may
raise their mighty voices and fill the world with the melody
of the Kingdom of Abhá. {{p28}} They must show an effort,
render some kind of service, create a whirlwind of
ecstasy and appear with manifest signs and power, so
that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá may obtain peace of mind and of
spirit....’”   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Interview with, the Indian Editor 

This morning the Beloved sent for Mírzá Munír and
dictated several Tablets to the Persian believers, many of
them having long or brief accounts of his western journey.
Later in the day, Mírzá Maḥmúd called on Moulavi
Mahboud Alam, the Indian Editor, and together they
visited the Master. As he was a Moslem, the discussion
dealt purely with the Muḥammadan world and made an
exposition of the means through which the different sects
might be brought closer together. The journalist was
much impressed by the talk of the Beloved and took notes
so that he might write a few articles on the Cause.   

About six o’clock we gathered in front of the hotel to
bid farewell to our Zoroastrian brother. Then we accompanied
him to the pier and while he was leaving in the
little boat to be conveyed to the steamer, I looked up, and
there in the heavens, beheld the most luminous crescent
that I had ever seen! It was small, semi-circular, silvery,
and so delicate! For a long time I looked at it, and the
hunger of my eyes could not be satisfied. It was the silvery
bow of the angels of God, the arrows of which are
meteors of Truth to disperse the hosts of ignorance and
intolerance. Returning to the hotel, we sat around the
table and looked into one another’s faces. For the first
time we were only five, and not only did we miss our
many pilgrims, but also the beloved friends beyond the
seas in Europe and America!   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 6, 1913. 

###  1. The Bahá’í Heart Is a Cool Fountain 

The heart of a Bahá’í is a cool spring from which eternally
gushes forth the pure water of divine knowledge
and heavenly wisdom. {{p29}} This water irrigates the soil of
humanity which is parched through the heat of dogmas
and the fire of superstitions. Immediately after the distribution
of this water, the flowers and anemones of
love and affection become manifest and the nostrils of
those who are remote and near are perfumed. Barren
ground is changed into a luxuriant garden, sterile soil
is made productive, bare trees are clad with verdant garments,
the silent nightingales break forth into songs of
gladness, the frost of the winter is transformed into
winsome spring, and the stillness of death is changed into
the buoyancy of life!   

The Bahá’í heart is a garden. Its gardner is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
With his tender hands he plants roses and violets,
carnations and tulips, chrysanthemums and lilies of the
valley. The beauty of these ideal flowers is in their imperishableness
and in the sweetness of their fragrance.
Day and night he sows the seeds from his never-ending
store. To him, the ground of every human heart is susceptible
to Divine Cultivation. That is why he has so
many gardens. He is the most successful spiritual gardener
that the world has ever seen! He knows the composition
of the soil and the chemical ingredients of every
part, and he applies his indisputable knowledge with real
success. {{p30}} Give to him the most barren, sterile patch of
ground, and before long it is a mass of flowers and an
orchard of fruitful trees.   

###  2. Another Interview with the Indian Editor, and
 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Talk on Education 

This morning the Beloved had a most interesting interview
with the Editor of “Peeseh Akbar.” The Editor
propounded many questions concerning the return of
the old glory of Islám, the education of the Eastern
women, the matter of the veil for women, etc., to each
one of which the Master gave detailed answer. The
Editor was carried away with enthusiasm, because he
found all his difficulties removed with such simple, yet
eloquent expressions. He wrote down all the Master told
him. He understands Persian quite well and is a progressive
and intelligent journalist. He has been out of India
for nearly seven months and expects to go to Tunis,
Europe and New York before returning to his native
land. The Master has given him an introduction to the
Persian Charge d’Affaires in Washington, D. C., so that
he may be shown all due respect and proper hospitality.   

Toward the end of his talk to him, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated
that we must ever think of the education of the public
and try our utmost to improve the conditions of the
submerged classes and to lay a solid foundation for
the erection of the Temple of human happiness. For the
realization of this hope, divine Education is essential, and
the inculcation of the idea of the oneness of the world
of humanity is necessary. We must deal with all with
loving kindness and be the real well-wishers of mankind.
They are the sheep of God and God is the Universal
Shepherd. He is compassionate to every member of His
flock. He trains all, He feeds all. He protects all. We
must free them from the old prejudices. We must confer
upon them a new life, which is cordial love, good-fellowship,
amity and unity, amongst the children of men. Our
behavior and conduct must be an example to them. {{p31}} We
must abandon all forms of prejudice, religious, racial,
sectarian, and national. The object of all the religions
has been the moral progress of the race. Only by walking
in this path can the illumination of the world be assured,
and the prosperity of mankind obtained.   

###  3. The Bahá’í Cause in Paris and Tablets for the friends 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá dictated several beautiful Tablets for Miss
Sanderson, Mons. et Madame Richard, Mons. et Madame
Bernard and Mr. and Mrs. Scott of Paris. He expressed
hope for the future illumination of Paris and exhorted
these friends to continue the spreading of the message.   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 7, 1913. 

###  1. Importance of Correspondence between the friends 

Often a letter from a far-off friend gives one good
cheer and encouragement. This is part of that invisible
chain which unites all mankind; more especially is this the
case with those who are working for a common Cause.
Thousands of miles, oceans and lands may divide them,
but when the word comes, the hearts are united, space and
time annihilated and they live as though in one room,
talking and conversing together and creating an atmosphere
of uplift. {{p32}} This in itself is a sufficient reason why
the Bahá’ís from various countries and out-of-the-way
places should correspond one with the other and keep
themselves informed, not only of the progress of the
Cause, which, is of course, the most important thing, but
of other current events which would be of interest.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Talk on the Enemies of the Cause 

This morning I was summoned to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence.
Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh was there. Packages of letters
were all around the Master. He was writing, and now
and then he raised his head and spoke, evidently following
the thread of a long conversation. When I arrived
he was saying that the Cause has many enemies! The
Bahá’ís must be very happy. The priests and the ‘Ulamás,
the Rabbis and the Mobeds are attacking the Cause right
and left, but their attacks make it stronger and more powerful.
We are invulnerable. We know no defeat. We
are fighters to the very last. There are no deserters in
the Grand Army of Abhá! They are all good fighters!
One of the missionaries in Beirut in his sermon cried out
in wrath and hopeless anger: — “We always thought that
the Bahá’ís would be a good, wholesome influence for
civilizing Islám alone, now they have started to civilize us
and are trying to teach us by demonstrating a plan of
propaganda, the like of which has never been seen since
the time of Christ and His Apostles!” Ah, me! We
have many enemies, bitter, dangerous and revengeful!
But we defeat them through the Power of Love! This
is our only weapon. The Ocean of the Cause is limitless,
shoreless, depthless. One wave and all these foams will
be scattered to the four corners of the sea. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
did not look at the present disturbed conditions of the
ocean. His heart was assured and confident as to the
future of the Cause. No person, no matter how powerful,
can shake the foundation of the Bahá’í Faith. It
rests upon the Eternal Rock of Ages. After the departure
of His Holiness Christ, there were only eleven
disciples. {{p33}} These were of the humble class, deprived of
any social distinction and yet their faith was often shaken,
but behold the result of their work! Now after the departure
of the Blessed Perfection there were more than
one million Bahá’ís scattered all over the earth, each one
faithful, sincere and self-sacrificing. Praise be to God,
that singly and alone, without any helper or assistant,
we are attacking the trained army of darkness and have
come out of the field victorious!   

Such is the sublime faith of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that must animate
and quicken all the Bahá’ís throughout the world.   

###  3. Arrival of Ḥájí Níáz, the Old Patriarch 

In the afternoon we were called again. Ḥájí Níáz had
just arrived from Cairo. He has been many times in the
presence of Bahá’u’lláh. He is a venerable Bahá’í, about
eighty years old, and has lived in Egypt for the last
thirty-five years. He is tall, has a long white beard and
wears a turban like the Master. He has a gentle personality,
and all the American Bahá’ís who have passed
through Cairo, have made it a point to see Ḥájí Níáz.
The Master loves him very much, and welcomed him with
open arms. He talked with him about the believers in
Cairo. Then the Master dictated several Tablets, including
a long one on “Universal Peace” for the Christian
Commonwealth. {{p34}} From this time on the Beloved may
write more Articles for the Western press to be read by
many thousands of people who cannot be reached otherwise.   

###  4. Tablet to the Editor of “The Christian Commonwealth”
on Universal Peace 

O THOU ESTEEMED KIND FRIENDS: —   

“After journeying throughout the United States of
America and the great capitals of Europe, I have returned
to the East. I am most pleased and well satisfied
with the result of this journey — because I met noble people
and associated with worthy souls, who are the cause
of honor and glory to the world of humanity. They are
learned and wise, well informed about the realities of
events, well-wishers of the human world, especially they
are advocates of Universal Peace.   

“In these days, the world of humanity is afflicted with
a chronic disease. It is one of bloodshed, of the destruction
of the divine edifice, of the demolition of cities and
villages, of the slaughter of the noble youths of the world
of humanity making children become orphans and women
homeless. What calamity is greater than this? What
crime is more heinous than this, what disease more dangerous,
what folly more direful?   

“Consider that in former days there were only religious
wars, but now there are racial and political wars,
fought at staggering expense and sacrifice. A thousand
times alas for this ignorance, for this bloodthirstiness and
ferocity!   

“I am pleased and grateful to the Societies which are
organized in the west for the promotion of universal
peace, with whose presidents, officers and members, I
have frequently conversed. I hope that the sphere of their
activities may from day to day, become enlarged, so that
the lights of higher ideals may illumine all regions, the
oneness of the world of humanity be proclaimed in
the East and in the West, and men attain composure and
well-being. {{p35}} These revered souls who are the servants and
the promoters of the cause of universal peace shall ere
long shine like brilliant stars upon the horizon of mankind,
flooding all regions with their glorious lights. In
the past century freedom was proclaimed and the foundations
of liberty were laid in all the western countries.
Praise be to God that the sun of justice has shone forth
and the darkness of despotism and tyranny has disappeared.   

“Now in this radiant century in which the world of
humanity is being matured, it is assured that the flag of
universal Peace shall become unfurled, waving over all
the regions of the globe. This is the most great principle
of Bahá’u’lláh, for the promotion of which all the
Bahá’ís are ready to sacrifice their possessions and their
lives.   

“Notwithstanding my bodily weakness and infirmity,
I have traveled East and West for the last three years.
In many temples I have cried out, and before many audiences
raised my voice for the enlistment of their sympathy.
I have declared the evils of war and explained the
benefits of Universal Peace. I have elucidated the causes
which lead to the honor and glory of the world of humanity
and told of the ferocity and bloodthirstiness of the
animal kingdom; I showed the defects of the world of
nature and made an exposition of the means whereby the
illumination of the world of humanity can fully be realized.
I unfolded and disclosed the foundations of divine
religion and proclaimed the teachings of His Holiness
Bahá’u’lláh. I demonstrated the existence of God by
irrefutable, rational proofs, and proved the reality of all
the prophets of God. I gave utterance to my inmost conviction
that the verity of the religion of God is the cause
of the life of the world of humanity; {{p36}} it is divine civilization
and pure enlightenment.   

“In giving the explanation of these principles, my object
has been no other than the desire to promote Universal
Peace. Praise be to God, I have found hearing ears,
observed seeing eyes, and discovered informed hearts.
Therefore I am well pleased with this journey.   

“But on the other hand the well-wishers of the world
of humanity and the advocates of Universal Peace must
make an extraordinary forward step, organize important
international congresses and invite as delegates progressive
and influential souls from all parts of the world; — so
that through their wise counsels and deliberations this
ideal of Universal Peace may leap out of the world of
words into the arena of actual and practical demonstration.
This question is of paramount importance and will
not be easily realized, but we must take hold of every
means until the desired result is obtained.   

“Fifty years ago, whosoever talked about Universal
Peace was not only ridiculed, but called visionary and
utopian. Now, praise be to God! it has assumed such importance
that every one acknowledges that this question
of Universal Peace is the light and spirit of the age.   

“I hope the noble leaders of the world of humanity
who are the divine bestowals among the people, and the
means of pacification among the nations, will arise with
the utmost effort and with whole-hearted resolution extinguish
this world-raging conflagration, especially now
that the blood of innocent people and the cries of orphans
are reaching to the very gate of heaven, while the harrowing
sorrow of mothers penetrates souls with the irresistible
force of human tragedy. {{p37}} Thus through the endeavors
of these guardians of the rights of mankind, the
world of creation may enjoy the repose of conciliation,
the banner of Universal Peace be unfurled, the tabernacle
of the oneness of the world of humanity be pitched, all
mankind be gathered under its protecting shade and the
shining star of eternal felicity and happiness of the world
of humanity will dawn with the utmost brilliancy from
the horizon of international comity, while the luminous
arks of spiritual brotherhood of all races and tongues will
illumine the united gathering of mankind with the ineffable
lights of God throughout countless ages and cycles.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 8, 1913. 

###  1. What is the Function of Real Religion? 

Pure religion, free from dogmas, contributes to the
happiness and progress of a people, suffering them to attain
to the highest summit of democracy and brotherhood.
Religion, hampered by the chains of fossilized
traditions will keep mankind within limits of intolerance
and prejudice. Religion must be as pure as the breeze
of the early morn, as bright as the stars of heaven, as
fragrant as the sweet flowers of spring, as clear as the
limpid and cooling water of the fountain, as verdant as
the delectable paradise, and as universal as the rays and
the heat of the sun.   

Therefore, when religion does not perform these functions,
it is not fulfilling its mission. In this connection
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in a Tablet just revealed to the Sixth International
Congress of Free and Progressive Christians and
other Religious Liberals to be held in Paris, July 16-22,
1913, says:   

“Thus religion, which was destined to become the
cause of friendship, has become the cause of enmity.
Religion, which was meant to be sweet honey, is changed
into bitter poison. Religion, whose function was to be
the illumination of the world of humanity has become the
factor of obscurantism and gloom. {{p38}} Religion, which was
to confer Everlasting Life has become the instrument of
death.”   

The duty of every one of us is, therefore, to spread
the principles of Pure religion, in accordance with the
needs of this age.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Perennial Cordiality and Courtesy 

When one enters the presence of the Beloved, even if it
is for the thousandth time, one feels quickened by the
spirit of reverence, humility, and evanescence. When
this morning I found myself, standing before him and
heard his rich vibrant voice greeting me: “You are welcome!
You are welcome!” I felt as though this was my
first visit to him. He always receives every one, even his
servants, with heavenly cordiality, a sweet smile, divine
courtesy, and inimitable friendship, making them feel as
though they were his own sons and daughters.   

###  3. The Joy of Serving ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

With his discourse, his remarks, and his teachings, he
uplifts one’s heart and makes one long to sacrifice everything
in his path. Really to be with him for one hour is
more glorious than a long association with all great men
of the world; and to render service to him is better than
serving kings. To win his good pleasure is a source of
eternal joy; to upraise the flag of his truth is more wonderful
than all the wealth of this earth! {{p39}} May we all remain
faithful to him and live and act in such a manner as
to win his approval! If we continue to be firm in the
Cause and pray every morn and eve for this pearl of great
price our brows will be crowned with the diadem of
God’s Bestowals! The Cause of humanity must become
a glowing fire in our hearts and not a flickering flame in
our minds. It must become a flowing fountain, ever
gushing forth from the innermost part of our beings!
No obstacle must seem to us insurmountable and no difficulty
discouraging. We must face all the problems, try to
solve them and encourage others through deeds and sympathy!
What if the whole world be against us! We may
be in the minority — the Christ and His Apostles were in
the minority 1900 years ago — but whenever God is on
the side of the minority it will become the majority.   

###  4. There Is a Power in This Cause 

After dictating several wonderful Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
laid stress upon the fact of the great power existing in
this Cause, a mysterious power, far, far, beyond the ken
of men and angels. That invisible power is the source
of all these outward activities. It moves hearts. It
rends mountains. It administers the complicated affairs
of the Cause. It inspires the friends. It dashes into a
thousand pieces all the forces of opposition. It creates
new spiritual worlds. This is a mystery of the Kingdom
of Abhá.   

The Tablets were for Mrs. Harriet C. Cline, and Mrs.
Mabel Rice-Wray of Los Angeles, Calif.; Miss Harriet
Magee of New York, Mrs. Dixon of Washington, D. C.,
Miss Dorothy Hodgson of Paris and Miss General Jack
of London.   

###  5. Ḥájí Níáz and the Story of the King and Ayaz 

Leaving the Beloved to his divine contemplation, I
went to the hotel and there had a talk with Ḥájí Níáz. {{p40}} I
knew him before my trip to America several years ago.
Through him I had received my first Tablet from the
Master and because of this I love him very much. In
fact everybody loves him. He is a veteran in the Cause.
He related in his rich language, the story of a king and
his ministers and courtiers.   

Once upon a time the king went out to hunt with the
members of his Cabinet, the Diplomatic Corps, the officials
of the Court and a large number of important personages,
especially invited for this occasion. As the king
intended to stay in the country, he ordered the Master
of Ceremonies to take the Imperial Tent which was a
wonderful work of art. On important occasions he had
in past seasons caused the inner walls and ceiling of this
royal tent to be decorated with hundreds of precious jewels.
This year also he asked the Minister of Finance to
take with him the casket of jewels. After many days
of preparation, the Imperial Caravan, which was more
than a mile long, set forth. The King headed the procession.
After him came the Cabinet Ministers, the
Diplomatic Corps, the courtiers and the guests. They
had to travel six days before they could reach the hunting
ground. After four days it so happened that the
horse carrying the box of jewels lagged at the end of the
Caravan. Three hours march, and the king looked
around, when to his apparent surprise, he found no one
with him except Ayaz, and observed the Caravan more
than a half mile away, surrounded with dust and great
confusion.   

“What is this?” {{p41}} asked the king.   

“Half an hour ago,” Ayaz humbly and serenely answered,
“The casket of jewels fell from the back of the
horse, and all of the precious stones were scattered on
the ground, and in the wild scramble that followed,
everyone forgot his duty, and tried to seize the jewels.”   

The king did not move or speak to show that an extraordinary
event had happened.   

But after a few moments of reflection, he said “Ayaz!”   

“Yes, my Lord.”   

“Why didst thou not join them to get a portion of the
spoil? Are they not precious jewels?”   

“Yes, my Lord. These jewels are good for them, but
I preferred to remain with thee. Thou art the greatest
Jewel of my life!”

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 9, 1913. 

###  1. Our Life in Port Sa‘íd 

My room has two doors which open on to the veranda
and at night there is always a cool breeze from the Mediterranean
which is not more than a thousand feet away.
At midnight I get up and go out and listen to the music
of the waves, played for the bright stars. To-night, the
moon is shining. The voices of the Arabs chanting
their Qur’án come to my ears. It is a weird, monotonous
sound, but very soothing. {{p42}} My table is covered with
papers and letters; Mírzá Maḥmúd, a few steps further,
is writing and copying Tablets. My light consists of a
dear little lamp. I am indeed happy.   

###  2. The Death of a Bahá’í Child and the Ceremony of
Her Burial 

We have just returned from a memorial meeting, held
on account of the death of Mírzá Jalál Af<u>sh</u>ár’s little
daughter, he is one of the Port Sa‘íd Bahá’ís. We were
invited at 5 P. M. to go to the funeral. Mírzá Maḥmúd
chanted one of the prayers of Bahá’u’lláh then the little
body was washed, wrapped in silk, and as there was no
ring for her finger, the prayer was written on a piece of
paper and put in the palm of her hand. The second ceremony,
the Muḥammadan, consisted of the coming of the
Mullá, and the chanting of prayers and then they carried
her body by hand to the near-by Mosque. All those
who entered the Mosque left their shoes at the door.
The body was laid on the floor, the tall Mullá before
it. We stood behind the Mullá. He began then to
read the prayer for the dead with the rapidity of lightning,
and from time to time raised his two hands to his
face and ears, which exercise was copied by us automatically,
according to custom. All this, however, did not take
more than five minutes. Several carriages were ready
at the door of the Mosque, and as soon as we came out,
Mírzá Jalál, his brother, the Mullá, carrying with both
hands the body of the child, and another relative got into
one carriage, and we followed in the others. We were
driven posthaste toward the cemetery, situated in the
west of the city. The Mediterranean was on our right
and always very near. On the way we observed many
little hills of soft silk-like sand, formed by the winds.
Often one observed the extremely soft sand trickling
down from the upper part of the little hills exactly like
the flowing of a tiny rivulet. {{p43}} It was a strange sight, and
reminded one of the passing of our own lives.   

###  3. The Christian and Muḥammadan Cemeteries 

First we drove by the Christian Cemetery, surrounded
by a wall. We saw the cross in all forms — large and small — defying the crescent of the Muḥammadan burying-place.
I had to stand up in the carriage to see the Christian
Cemetery. It was not as beautiful and flowery as
the Cemeteries of America — because it is most difficult,
in this land of sand, to raise trees and flowers — but it
was fairly clean and one could see patches of green and
there were flowers here and there. Finally, we reached
the Muḥammadan cemetery! It was very unclean.
Shrieking Arab men and women were in evidence. The
tombstones are made of wooden boxes, and I believe
a spark of fire would burn the whole place. The dead
girl was interred beside her grandfather, buried here a
few years ago. The poor father was weeping and quite
inconsolable. Ḥájí Níáz, being the oldest man, tried to
comfort him.   

###  4. Visiting Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí’s Tomb in the Cemetery 

Probably many of the American friends remember the
faithful Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí through whom the East and the
West carried on a large and voluminous correspondence
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He died a few years ago and his body
is buried in this cemetery. I met him during my first
visit to ‘Akká, and from that time till the day of his death
corresponded with him. I expressed a desire to visit
his tomb. Yúsuf directed us to it, and we offered a
prayer. {{p44}} Unless one knows the place, it is not possible to
find it, for there is no tombstone, a piece of wood without
an inscription is its only mark. Ḥájí Níáz knew
Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí well. The brief outline of his life is as
follows:   

###  5. Outline of Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí’s Life and His Services to
the Bahá’í Cause 

He was from Man<u>sh</u>ád, a little village near Yazd.
In his early youth he had accepted the revelation, but had
found the people of his own village extremely fanatical
and dogmatic, and as the rabble threatened to kill him,
finally left the place and moved to the city of Kirmán.
There he began to teach the Cause but when the ‘Ulamás
received news of his presence, they sent word to him that
he must leave the city immediately or they would take
the law into their own hands. So with much difficulty
and privation he came at last to the city of <u>Sh</u>íráz. After
some time, with the object of visiting Bahá’u’lláh, he
made a pilgrimage to Mecca, and thus acquired the much-respected
title of “Ḥájí.” From Mecca he went to
Alexandria. It was before the Arabi Revolution. Here,
with a number of other Persians, he engaged in business,
but not being constitutionally fitted for that kind of work,
and having always the hope of serving the Cause, and of
beholding the Face of the Blessed Perfection, he one day
left everything and went to ‘Akká. After attaining the
supreme desire of his heart, he made ‘Akká his final home
and there tried to seek congenial occupation. Little by
little, his eagerness to serve the Cause, and his longing
to devote his whole time to the Movement, was demonstrated,
and Bahá’u’lláh from time to time gave him a
packet of Tablets to mail to different parts of the Orient.
When the believers from all over the world observed that
they received their Tablets through him, they began directing
their petitions in his care so that he might give
them personally to Bahá’u’lláh and intercede for them
Thus, without any ceremonies or formalities, Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí
became the most well-known and talked of Bahá’í.
Every one was eager to receive his letters. {{p45}} It has often
been stated by those believers who are familiar with both
Persian and English writings, that Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí and
Mr. Chas. Mason Remey were brothers in calligraphy,
only Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí was an older brother.   

###  6. Man<u>sh</u>ádí’s Epistolary Style and His Peculiarities 

Man<u>sh</u>ádí’s letters are well preserved by all the Persians.
Ḥájí Níáz tells me that he has 500 of them. I may
have two hundred or more. These letters are masterpieces
of news writing. He had a sense for bare facts
and news and he knew that no one expected philosophy
from him or the literary style of Oriental compliments.
He had done away with all this form. It was really a
radical departure from the established rule and many
young people, seeing the wisdom of his course, followed
his epistolary innovations. The letters generally opened
with a few sentences about the Master’s health and his
family. This to the Bahá’í world, was considered the
most important part. Then the record of the arrival and
departure of the pilgrims, their names, the events in
‘Akká, a general outline of the progress of the Cause in
other parts of the world, etc. They were indeed “newsy
letters.” After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh the activities
of the Cause increased a hundredfold, the number of
the believers became considerably larger, the movement
spread in America and Europe and the matter of correspondence
with all these heterogeneous elements became
of the utmost importance. The Master looked about for
an efficient experienced man. {{p46}} who could hold in his hand
the helm of the ship of correspondence, and who with a
cool head and infinite patience, could direct it through
the tempestuous seas of difficulties. In the whole Bahá’í
world, there was no one more fitting than Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí,
and he was selected for the position. For many years he
worked untiringly, unceasingly, ever receiving assistance
from the Supreme Concourse. In his early days at ‘Akká
and Haifa, his room became a general meeting-place for
all the Bahá’ís. “I will see you tonight at Man<u>sh</u>ádí’s
home at such and such an hour,” was an oft quoted expression.
The door was open to everyone. All pilgrims
were welcome. He was always the first to go to the
steamer to greet the newcomers or say farewell to those
who were returning, laden with the spiritual gifts from
the Presence of Bahá’u’lláh. Ḥájí Níáz says: —   

“Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí was well known amongst all the
Bahá’ís for his fidelity, simplicity, loving disposition,
truthfulness, sincerity and above all, for his ability to
serve everyone with gentleness, courtesy, and marvelous
patience. His room was furnished with simplicity. He
always sat on the floor, surrounded with a pile of letters.
He was often literally buried in them. He smoked a
‘water-pipe’ all the time, and an over-indulgence in this,
finally caused his death.”   

When Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd sent several commissioners
to ‘Akká and conditions became intolerable, the “Beloved”
sent Taqí Man<u>sh</u>ádí to Port Sa‘íd — so that from
this place he might carry on his work, it was in this
town that he passed away at the age of sixty, serene and
happy. The Master was much grieved when he heard the
news, and after a while appointed Siyyid Asadu’lláh in
his place, this position he has filled with credit to the
Cause and to himself. I hear however, that Siyyid
Asadu’lláh is going to leave for Russia tomorrow to
teach the Cause. {{p47}} After the wonderful trip through America
and Europe he will no doubt be confirmed in attracting
many souls to the Kingdom of Abhá! The Master, before
long, will appoint another person to carry on his work.   

###  7. How to Conduct Bahá’í Meetings, and the
Importance of Public Speaking 

This morning, I called on the Beloved. He had received
packages of letters, some from America. There is one
point which has been brought to his attention of late. It
is this: — In certain Assemblies in America a number of
the believers desire to exclude all public speaking and to
confine themselves to the reading of Tablets, etc. This is
positively not in accordance with the Bahá’í Plan of teaching,
nor with the instructions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. To read
Tablets, and the Holy Writings is only half of the aspect
of the question; the other aspect is the delivery of eloquent
addresses and fluent talks elucidating the spirit of
the Cause. The Master’s wish is always to encourage the
believers to speak at the meetings. This I know is his will.
When today the subject was again presented to him in
a letter from America, he told me that he had written
in many Tablets that the friends must speak at the meetings.
We must encourage public-speaking, especially in
those who have this talent. The Cause must be spread
through eloquent, sincere addresses. We must unloose
the tongue, spread the Fragrances of God and diffuse the
words of God. We must present to the public the proofs
and evidences of this Cause with a language of fire — so
that souls may be exhilarated, and minds become full of
tumult and of acclamation. With words of Love and illumination
we must set the hearts aglow with this Fire
of Divine Truth, and enkindle the spirits with this Power
of the Kingdom. We must explain the Teachings orally,
so that the consciousness of men may be stirred; then
invisible inspirations will descend. {{p48}} Bounties from the
Holy Spirit will be revealed, rays from the Sun of Reality
will shine forth, Breezes from the Paradise of Abhá
will waft abroad and the Glad-tidings of the Kingdom
spread throughout the world.   

###  8. Tablet by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Regarding the Delivery of
Eloquent Speeches 

Then he revealed a Tablet on this subject and may
issue others before long: —   

“Thou hast written concerning the spiritual meeting.
The spiritual meeting must be in the utmost state of ecstasy
and tumult. Prayers may be recited, Tablets and
verses read, eloquent speeches delivered and divine proofs
explained. Then the audience may be encouraged and incited
to enter the Kingdom of God, news received from
different countries may be imparted and at the end they
may repeat collectively a supplication.”   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 10, 1913. 

###  1. Siyyid Asadu’lláh Departs for Russia to Spread the
Message 

Our traveling companion, and fellow-worker, Siyyid
Asadu’lláh Qumí, who has been with Bahá’u’lláh and the
Master for many years and traveled with the latter
throughout America and Europe, left today for the Caucasus
to teach the Cause. {{p49}} We will miss him. He has been
like a father to us during our wanderings and although
Mírzá Maḥmúd wrote the official report of the trip of
the Beloved, yet Siyyid Asadu’lláh corresponded with the
friends in small assemblies all over the East. They could
not receive any direct news, were he not traveling with
us. Now, detached from all else save God, alone, at the
age of seventy-six, he faces the world. Carrying in his
hand the Ideal Banner of the Cause, he leaves port Said
with a firm confidence and trust in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.   

After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh he made a trip
through Persia, taught many souls, and was bitterly
persecuted for his glorious faith. Last night and this
morning he went to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and no doubt received
his orders and heavenly benediction. Today at one o’clock
we were all gathered at the station, to bid him farewell.
He goes first to Alexandria to meet Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl
and then taking a ship, will sail for Constantinople.   

###  2. Siyyid Asadu’lláh’s Talk with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His
Glowing Resolution 

I confess that nothing has so deeply stirred me in my
whole Bahá’í career as the heavenly resolution of this
old man to go alone into the world and teach the Cause!
He himself went to the Master and begged for his permission.
He said: “I have heard thy glorious proclamation
from pulpits and platforms. I have seen wondrous
scenes of the Majesty of Our Lord. I have hearkened to
the divine words falling from thy blessed lips. My Lord!
My cup is full to overflowing. I am an old man. I question
if I can accomplish anything in thy cause, but I supplicate
thee to let me try. I can contain myself no longer.
I do not wish to flicker out on the couch of rest, but long
to end on the battlefield. {{p50}} I would love to die as a soldier,
fighting the good fight to the very last moment, and not
as a pensioner.”   

And so he went! With such a superhuman example
of deeds and self-sacrifices does anybody wonder why
the Bahá’í Cause has such stupendous power? All the
friends in America and Europe who have met our dear
brother Siyyid Asadu’lláh love him, and I know that
from the depth of their hearts they will pray that the
Lord may keep him and protect him many years yet for
the service of His Cause, and as a witness to His Power.   

###  3. Farewell to Siyyid Asadu’lláh 

My beloved Siyyid Asadu’lláh farewell! You have been
a loving companion and a faithful attendant to our Beloved!
Your cheerful face and disposition shall never be
forgotten! Your memory will shine in our inmost hearts
as a radiant star! Your faith will be a glorious example
for all the younger generations. During the years of your
life you have served your God to the best of your ability!
You have suffered and accepted much persecution in the
Path of Bahá! And now, although a veteran of many
wars, you are again enlisted in the ranks of active work
and are entering on a new campaign! Farewell!   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Expectation to Go to Ismailia 

For a few minutes we were privileged to see the
Master in the morning. He said that the weather in Port
Sa’íd had not agreed with him, and that he expected to
leave tomorrow for Ismailia, a town about one hour and
fifteen minutes from this city. He is going there for two
or three days and if all goes well, he will send for us.
Aḥmad Yazdí and <u>Kh</u>usraw will accompany him.   

###  5. Poems of Mr. Moxey Read to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

In the afternoon Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Qásim Iṣfaháni and
Mírzá Maḥmúd, two merchant Bahá’ís from Cairo arrived
with their wives to see the Master. {{p51}} They accompanied
me into his holy presence. He was dressed in
spotless white and looked very beautiful. A large envelope
containing the poems of Mr. Frank K. Moxey of 575
Riverside Drive, New York City, had just been received.
The Master gave them to me to read. After looking
over the title of each, I told him about them. He then
asked me to translate the poem on the Báb, which I did
immediately. He was most pleased and praised it very
highly. The poem is very eloquent and shows true inspiration.
It is hoped that he will continue to write upon such
soul-stirring ideals. A Bahá’í poet is needed in America
There are many in Persia.   

###  6. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Speaks about the “Star of the West” 

Then the Master took from the table the “Star of the
West,” No. 5, and showed all those who were present
the photograph of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár Convention in
New York City. He was very happy, saying: “Look at
this photograph and wonder at the penetrating influence
of the Bahá’í Cause.”   

He expressed the hope that the “Star of the West”
would, little by little, widen its field and become a power
for good in the Cause and in humanitarian activities. Its
Persian section is eagerly read by all the Bahá’ís.   

###  7. Talk on His Tour to America 

Then, referring to his arduous tour through the United
States, he mentioned that the confirmation and assistance
of the Blessed Perfection were his companions;
otherwise his body could never have stood all the difficulties
of the voyage. {{p52}} He did not feel well, yet he worked.
He traveled. He went there. He came here. He did not
give any importance to his body. The wisdom of this
was that the believers might see with their own eyes that
he was rising above hardships, vicissitudes, sickness and
troubles so that the Cause might prosper. Except for the
diffusion of the Fragrances of God, he desired nothing.
Except for service at the Threshold of Abhá, he cared
for nothing. His hope was to teach the Cause, to proclaim
the Glad-tidings of the appearance of the Kingdom
of Abhá, and to advance the Cause of International
peace and human brotherhood.   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 11, 1913. 

###  1. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Departure for Ismailia 

Knowing that the beloved departs today for the city of
Ismailia, we called on him about 6:30 A. M. The train
leaves at eight, so we had ample time to have our last
meeting. There were several pilgrims, who had just arrived,
and to them he expressed his regrets. He will stay
there two or three days. If the weather agrees with him,
he will rent a house and send for us. {{p53}} If not, he will return,
and go either to Alexandria or Ramleh.   

###  2. He Praises the American Bahá’ís 

He spoke about the innumerable meetings he had attended
in America, and how he found in the believers a
true spiritual sense, and a divine and heavenly attraction
which made them strive upward; how the paeans of their
glad praises were raised to the supreme Concourse; how
they were making great efforts to bring into being the
spiritual consciousness of mankind; how they were servants
of the oneness of the world of humanity, the promoters
of universal Peace and the standard-bearers of
the spiritual brotherhood of man.   

###  3. He Tells the Persians about Fred Mortenson Who
Traveled from Minneapolis to Green
Acre in Order to See Him 

Then he told the Persian friends about Fred Mortenson,
a young Bahá’í from Minneapolis, who had been so
anxious to meet the Master that he risked his life by
concealing himself under the train till he reached Green
Acre, Maine.   

Praising the courage of this fine clean fellow ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said that when he passed through Minneapolis he
had again met him and his wife. {{p54}} Such events could not
happen by the effort of any human being, but they are
the confirmations of the Holy Spirit and the marvelous
signs of this Dispensation!   

About 7:45 the carriage was ready, the two small
satchels of the Beloved were brought down, and after
saying farewell to each one of us, he was taken to the
station, Aḥmad Yazdí and <u>Kh</u>usraw accompanying him.   

###  4. The Absence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Is Noticed Everywhere 

We returned home saddened because we could not go
with the master, but were consoled by looking forward to
our reunion, which would not be long.   

A young Persian Bahá’í, by the name of Áqá Jamál,
arrived yesterday from Haifa, and he will cook for us
in our own apartment as long as we are here. He is a
tall, quiet man, very willing to serve and to please everybody.   

Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar, Ḥájí Níáz and Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh live
in the hotel, but for their board and tea they come to
us. Ḥájí Níáz is a good conversationalist and knows
many anecdotes and stories. While I was writing in my
room, they had gathered around him on the veranda and
he spoke to them about many things of interest.   

At noon we received a telephone message from Aḥmad
Yazdí assuring us of the master’s safe arrival and that
he is stopping at the Hotel Vaseteef. He is pleased with
the place and is well.   

In the afternoon we were again gathered on the
veranda, drinking tea and talking about the Cause; Ḥájí
Níáz described his meetings with Prof. E. G. Browne of
Cambridge University, when he was in Egypt, when the
latter was invited to the house of <u>Kh</u>urasání, where all
day one of the Bahá’í teachers discussed with him aspects
of the Cause referring to rational and scriptural proofs.   

Let me translate for you a few extracts from recent
Tablets: —   

###  5. Tablet on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Trip in America 

“Less than a year, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá raised the cry of ‘Ya
Bahá’u’l-Abhá’ from his heart and soul as he crossed the
mountains and deserts of that continent! {{p55}} In churches
and meetings he imparted the Glad-tidings of the appearance
of the Kingdom of God. With a resonant voice he
announced the dawn of the Sun of Reality and explained
divine proofs and evidences. With a heart and spirit
overflowing with the Love of God he raised the New
Wonderful Melody. Undoubtedly it will have great effect.
Consider that the soul-imparting Melody of His Holiness
Christ, (may my life be a sacrifice to him!) became
effective and world-conquering after three hundred years,
but in a short space of time the Song of the Kingdom of
Abhá has quickened the East and the West!   

The future of the Cause in Stuttgart:

“I hope that the Ensigns of Divine Verses may be upraised
in Stuttgart; the Fire of the Love of God be so enkindled
as to set all those parts aglow, and that each one
of those blessed souls may become as a bright candle,
shedding the light of guidance in every direction.”   

###  6. The Power of the Bahá’í Cause 

“The Glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abhá can overcome
hard stones and resuscitate dried bones. Like unto
the downpouring of the vernal shower, they cause the
growth of roses and hyacinths, jasmine and jonquils to
come forth out of black soil! Likewise if the inhabitants
of a city are submerged in the sea of materialism, it may
take some time to awaken them, yet the Melody of the
Kingdom of Abhá shall finally quicken them; the cup
of the Love of God will become full to overflowing, imparting
a wonderful exhilaration to allay the thirst of the
thirsty ones.”   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 12, 1913. 

###  1. Telephone Message from Ismailia about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

Today at noon we received a telephone message from
Ismailia giving us news of the master’s improved health
and wishing us to give his greeting to each one of the
friends. Two Bahá’ís arrived from Cairo, not knowing
that the Master was not here. We entertained them to
the best of our ability with stories of the spiritual Conquest
of the Beloved in the West. As one of them had
only two days leave from his work, we got the Master’s
consent by telephone, that he might be permitted to see
him in Ismailia.   

Everybody was here as usual talking about the Cause;
Ḥájí Níáz told us about some incidents in the life of
Bahá’u’lláh. Toward evening we walked to the quay
where the Casino Palace Hotel, the small municipal garden
and DeLessep’s statue are situated. We observed
great preparations for festivities and upon inquiry were
told that the French were celebrating their Independence
Day, 14th of the month.   

As there is a strong element of French in the Canal
Company, they seem desirous to impress the Egyptians
with their patriotism, and they are making very elaborate
preparations. {{p57}} In Cairo they celebrate this Feast on a
much larger scale.   

###  2. Mírzá Maḥmúd Prepares Three Volumes on the Tour
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Throughout Europe and America 

The last few days Mírzá Maḥmúd is preparing
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s addresses from the time he sailed from Alexandria
to America. These addresses will form the first volume;
the second will be his diary in Persian of the journey,
and the third the translation of the articles which appeared
in the principal papers and magazines of America
and Europe. Once these books are published and circulated
in the Orient, they will have great effect in furthering
the Cause of the Kingdom of Abhá!   

###  3. Translation of a Tablet to the Believers in Kirmán,
Persia 

The following is a Tablet to the believers of Kirmán,
Persia:   

“O ye kind friends! A letter was received from Kirmán
giving you utmost praise and saying, the friends
of God are like unto flames of fire and radiant lamps of
the Kingdom; they are as fire-temples of spirituality and
brilliant stars of heaven. This letter has become the
cause of happiness to my heart, for praise be to God, the
Fire of the Love of God is set aglow in Kirmán, the veils
which have covered their eyes are burned away; the believers
are attracted and stirred into gladness, and the
friends are in a state of supplication and invocation.
Therefore, I prayed and implored at the Divine Threshold
and wished for the beloved ones a cup overflowing with
the Grace of God, so that, in Kirmán, the day of resurrection
may be set up, the hearts become exhilarated, the
city moved by the resounding voice, and the world stirred
with the power of the Holy Spirit!   

“Praise be to God! {{p58}} The Eastern horizon is luminous
and the nostrils of the people of the West are perfumed.
The splendor of the luminary of the East has cast a reflection
upon the West which has illumined it. The Voice
of the Almighty is raised in these regions and the Pure
Religion of God is being promoted. Ere long it shall
yield important results and the ensign of ‘Ya Bahá El
Abhá’ shall be lifted so high as to wave over all the
continents.”   

###  4. How to Deliver Bahá’í Public Addresses 

“The basis of this divine call (teaching and delivering
addresses) must be the oneness of the world of humanity;
so that religious fanaticism, sectarian bias, racial prejudice
and political rivalry may be removed, so that all
mankind may enter under the uni-colored tent of the
oneness of the world of humanity, and hearts may affiliate
with each other, souls be attracted and East and West
embrace each other. This must be the basis of your
addresses in public meetings.”   

###  5. How Great Movements Have Advanced 

“All great movements have advanced through altruism,
selflessness, and self-sacrifice and not merely through an
interchange of public opinions. It is my hope that all
may arise with the greatest power to serve this most important
Cause (Universal Peace) and become the means
of the welfare of the world of humanity.”   

###  6. About ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s American Tour to a Persian
Bahá’í 

“It is nearly two years and a half since I have been a
wanderer over mountains and deserts and a traveler over
seas and lands. {{p59}} The journey was extended to many
climes.... The penetrative power of the Holy Cause
has stirred the columns of the world. In many cities of
America the Divine Call was raised. Likewise in the
countries of Europe. In numerous churches, clubs, groups
and Universities of America the Glad-tidings of the
Kingdom of Abhá were explained precisely with resonant
voice, and no one arose to make opposition. They
listened most attentively and afterwards expressed their
pleasure. Ere long this Call shall yield glorious results
and will fill the world with its fruits.”

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 13, 1913. 

One of the believers, Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim Iṣfaháni
coming from Cairo a few days ago brought with him
a package belonging to Siyyid Asadu’lláh. This package
among other things contained three precious volumes of
Tablets from the pen of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They are copies
of very old letters, some of them addressed to the believers
in America. Herein I will translate a few. The
following may have been revealed to one of the American
Assemblies and probably is sixteen years old: —   

###  1. Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Progress 

“He is El Abhá!   

O YE FRIENDS OF THE BLESSED PERFECTION!   

“This century is the century of attraction. This Cycle
is the Cycle of His Highness the Lord of Lords. {{p60}} The
East and West are in commotion and acclamation and
the North and South in ecstasy and tumult. The world
is progressing with marvelous acceleration and the realm
of existence is growing and developing with an eternal
velocity and at geometric ratio. Mankind, like unto a
suckling babe is being trained in the Arms of Providence,
and humanity like unto a newly planted tree in the ground
of the world, is waxing in stature and size, becoming
more beautiful and lovely through the downpour of the
rain of Grace. The greater the exertion, the more the
descent of the divine Bestowal. The more we ascend
heavenward, the greater will be the realization of universal
progress from all directions.   

“Therefore, O ye friends of the Ancient Beauty and
ye beloved ones of the Most Great Name! Make an effort,
so that in all the grades of Human existence,
whether spiritual or material, ye may make extraordinary
advancement. The Mercy and Favor of His Highness,
the One is with us!   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

Here is another Tablet which was revealed probably
thirteen years ago to (Mrs. Helen G. Goodall), a believer
in San Francisco, California, the contents of which shows
how the Master’s prayers are fulfilled in her behalf: —   

###  2. A Tablet by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Personal Illumination
and Guiding Others to the Truth 

“O thou spiritual pearl and leaf stirred by the wafting
of the Breeze of God! Verily with a heart overflowing
with love and affection I perused thy letter which was
an eloquent expression of thy praise for the love of God,
of thy firmness in the Covenant of God, {{p61}} thy gladness
through the Fragrances of God and thy great exertion
in the guidance of the servants of God!   

“Verily I supplicate God to confirm thee with the
Breaths of the Holy Spirit, to dilate thy breast with the
Zephyrs wafting from the direction of the Paradise of
Abhá and to suffer thee to become a light from which
radiates the rays of supplication, invocation and prayers
toward the Kingdom of God: — so that thou mayest become
a Cause of the awakening, mindfulness and quickening
of the servants and maid servants of God, and a
means of giving them of the wine of knowledge and
of summoning them to the Kingdom of the Merciful with
evidences and proofs....”   

I will close this day by the translation of another wonderful
Tablet: —   

###  3. The Day of the Glorious Bounties of the Invisible
Kingdom of Abhá 

“He is El Abhá!   

O YE REAL FRIENDS!   

“This day is the day of the Glorious Bounties of the
Invisible Kingdom of Abhá and of the tumultuous waving
of the seas of the Inexhaustible Bestowals of the
Supreme Countenance. The rays of his effulgences have
dawned from all directions and the breezes of His generosity
and compassion are wafting from all parts. The
doors of His kingdom are flung wide and the verses of
His Omnipotence are spread abroad. His ancient Grace
like a mighty torrent is flowing with great impetuosity,
and His manifest light is apparent from the horizon of
Certainty like unto a shining moon.   

“But these servants must appreciate the value of this
Eminent Grace and consider this sublime generosity as
the most great Bounty; — so that we may become its signs
and be illumined with its rays. {{p62}} When vernal showers
descend upon good and pure soil, flowers will grow
therein and the black earth will become a delectable
Paradise.”   

###  4. Mrs. Stannard May Go to India and Teach the
Bahá’í Cause 

Mrs. J. Stannard, an English Bahá’í, is back in Port
Sa’íd and may stay with us for several days. I had a
most pleasant conversation with her about the progress
of the Cause in Germany and England. The Master
may send her to India. She is a very active and energetic
worker and no doubt will be able to spread the Bahá’í
movement very effectively.   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 14, 1913. 

###  1. The French Day of Independence in Port Sa‘íd 

The European part of Port Sa‘íd is decorated with
thousands of Japanese lanterns, the French flag is seen
everywhere, and everybody seems to enter into the spirit
of celebration on this National Feast of the Republic of
France. After sunset the principal avenues, the French
Consulate, the Banks, firms and buildings are lighted up
by electricity. The street in which the Eastern Exchange,
Continental and Casino Palace Hotels are built, is a riot
of music promenaders, Arabs, Greeks, Italians, English,
German, and French. {{p63}} Everybody is out to have a good
time and to see the sights. The avenue from one end to
the other is wired, and a roof is constructed of Japanese
lanterns. The trees also bear such luminous fruits.
During the day there have been many public functions and
receptions in the Consulate, in the government house and
in the Canal Company headquarters. Last night there
was a grand Ball in the Casino Palace Hotel. About
eight o’clock we left home, our destination being the
Municipal Park. The Casino Palace Hotel is so built
that it fronts the Mediterranean and on the other side
faces the Park. The hotel was illumined from top to
bottom with electric festoons and it was indeed a glorious
sight to thousands of Arabs, men, women and children —
who had come to see what wonders these — “strangers” have wrought! The weather was cool, a brisk
breeze was wafting from the sea. The heaven was clear
and the soft silver rays of the Queen of night streamed
down upon a merry-making population. The searchlight,
built upon a high pillar to guide ships into the harbor,
revolved round and round, sending its powerful rays
into the remote distances of the sea. At nine o’clock a
cannon boomed forth, and the display of fireworks was
started. More than twenty coal barges were tied together
at the wharf. People crowded near the harbor. The fireworks
were on these barges and hundreds of rockets
ascended to the skies displaying many colors. Some
strange, fantastic contrivances, were displayed on the
water, which ran hither and thither like lizards. For
one hour and a half the display of pyrotechnics continued,
showing all the original devices and magical works that
a French mind can invent.   

As soon as the fireworks started, three ships illuminated
from top to bottom, came into view from the other
side of the port. These were followed by more than one
hundred boats in an orderly line, all brilliantly lighted
with electricity. {{p64}} It was really a very imposing naval
procession, fairy-like, picturesque and beautiful. Beside
these boats there were several hundred others belonging
to the merry-makers, afloat on the calm sea. Now and
then the air brought to our ears the sweet notes of a
mandolin or guitar.... It was half past eleven when
we returned home!   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Life in Ismailia 

This morning Aḥmad Yazdí returned from Ismailia
and brought good news of the Beloved. The first two
days he had not felt well, but now he is resting better.
While there he had met an old friend of his, a famous
doctor who had prescribed a regime of rest and diet to
be followed strictly. The Master has decided to remain
a week; if the weather agrees with him he will send for
all of us, if not, he will return and then may go to Ramleh.
He has sent for Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh to go to him as
soon as possible. So he left at seven P. M., and will be
in Ismailia at 8:15 P. M.   

Today I will translate another Tablet to an American
Bahá’í:   

###  3. What Constitutes Everlasting Fame 

O THOU WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY THE LIGHTS SHINING
FROM THE KINGDOM OF GOD!   

“Verily I have read thy eloquent letter and wonderful
epistle expressing thy excessive joy through the divine
Glad-tidings, and reflecting the susceptibilities of thy conscious
and spiritual emotions through the Bestowals of
His Majesty the Lord of mankind. Blessed art thou for
this Bounty! Gladness be unto thee for this Gift! Rejoicing
be thine for this confirmation. {{p65}} Happiness be
unto thee for this assistance. Ere long thou shalt behold
with eyes of beatitude the signs of success and prosperity
because of thy firmness in the Love of God, thy steadfastness
in the Covenant of God, thy superlative attraction
to God, thy unwavering perseverance in the diffusion
of the Fragrance of God and thy source of joyousness
through the Glad-tidings of God!   

“Know thou, verily I say unto thee that the condition
of this mortal world, even if it is the kingship of the
whole expanse of the Globe, is ephemeral. It is an illusion.
It ends in nothing, neither does it contain any results
nor in the estimation of God is it equal to the wing
of a mosquito. Where are the kings and the queens?
Where are the palaces and the empresses? Where are
the imperial thrones and jeweled crowns? Where are
the mighty rulers of Persia, Greece and Rome? Verily
their palaces are in ruin and desolation, their thrones destroyed,
and their crowns cast in the dust. But any one
of the maid-servants of God who has arisen in the diffusion
of the Fragrances of God, serving the Kingdom
of God, summoning the people to the Word of God,
eternally her signs shall be widely spread and handed
down through centuries and cycles; her dawn shall ever
be luminous; her star always shining; her flag continually
flying; her station divinely glorified; her crown scintillating;
her message living; her fame immortal; her voice
resonant; her spirit in the apex of the Kingdom; and her
effulgence in the horizon of the Realm of Might I beg
of God to make thee one of these maid-servants.”   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 15, 1913. 

In the Persian notes of our brother Mírzá Maḥmúd
I find a glorious message to the Unitarians of America
which I am sure was not translated at the time: It is
the second day after the Beloved’s departure from Alexandria,
March 26 or 27th, 1912. An American woman
expresses her interest in the Cause, saying that she is a
Unitarian and requesting the Master to send a message
to them in the United States. Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá utters
the following words: —   

###  1. The Message of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Unitarians 

“Convey to the Unitarians my loving greetings and
say; The most exalted aim in this world is the promotion
of the Love of God and the establishment of good
fellowship and unity between the people. This is the
signal distinction between man and beast. When thou
reachest America, announce to the Unitarians: —   

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The Sun of Universal
Love hath dawned;

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The Banquet of friendship
and divine association is spread.   

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The Banner of the Kingdom
of God is unfurled!   

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The heavenly Spring
hath appeared.   

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The Cloud of spiritual
Grace is pouring down!   

Glad-tidings! {{p67}} Glad-tidings! The trees of the orchard
of humanity are verdant and abloom.   

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The Herald of the Kingdom
hath become manifest.   

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The prophecies of the
holy Books have been fulfilled.   

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The age of human
brotherhood is dawning upon mankind!   

Glad-tidings! Glad-tidings! The Century of light and
Universal Peace hath come!”   

As I read these vital words it seemed to me that they
were a most significant prelude to the enthusiastic reception
given to him by the Unitarians of America at their
Convention in Boston, in the Tremont Temple.   

Another beautiful talk that I may be permitted to translate
here from the Persian notes is the Beloved’s words
to Bishop Birch of New York, who came to call on him
at the Hotel Ansonia on the sixth day of his arrival
After a preliminary conversation he said:   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Conversation with Bishop Birch of
New York City 

“Praise be to God that stupendous material developments
are obtained in this country; but material civilization
alone does not safeguard the progress of a nation;
because through material civilization, dynamite, Krupp
guns, projectiles and Mauser’s rifles are invented: thus
the infernal instruments of human fratricide are multiplied
and constantly perfected. Therefore, natural civilization
fosters both good and evil. All this warfare, and
bloodshed, and all this feverish multiplication of military
armaments are the results of material civilization. When
material civilization joins hands with spiritual civilization,
then it will be perfect. {{p68}} In former times a wooden
box may have protected your objects from the thief, but
now safes with their complicated keys and signs do not
daunt the robbers. Consequently just as ‘good’ is advanced
through material civilization, ‘evil’ has taken the
same pace. Earthly civilization must become the handmaid
of heavenly civilization. Natural civilization is
like unto the body of man. If the body is animated by
the spirit, it is alive, otherwise it is a corpse which in
time will become decomposed.”   

The Bishop expressed his pleasure and delight at hearing
the above words of truth. The Master replied:   

###  3. Some Churches are Free from Prejudices 

“I am likewise very grateful to you. Praise be to God
that your churches are free from prejudice. They are
not so creed-bound as to be unable to breathe. Many
Christian Churches in Europe are as yet extremely dogmatic,
but I have already spoken in churches belonging
to your denomination. The congregations consisted of
most delightful and intelligent people. This is a great
distinction. I love you with all my heart and soul. My
chief aim is to remove the present misunderstanding between
the nations of the East and the West: — so that
we may express love toward each other and promote the
essentials of heavenly civilization. I hope that such a
confirmation may be vouchsafed, so that we may become
united.”   

The Bishop said —   

>  “Up to this time no one has come from the East to
the West with such power, such lucid teachings and such
exalted aims. Therefore I am very grateful to you and
most pleased to have met you.” 

The third contribution for today is going to be a part
of a touching Tablet revealed by the Beloved to a friend
in ‘Akká, on the fourth of this month. {{p69}} He says in part:   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Expresses Desire to Visit the Shrine
of His Father in ‘Akká 

“Truly I say, the extreme desire of my heart and soul
is to be present at the Court of Bahá’u’lláh, so that I
may perfume my face and my locks with the dust of the
Holy Threshold. It is now three years since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has been deprived of this Favor and has remained too
far to become the recipient of the dawning lights of that
brilliant spot. Day and night he has suffered from regret
and deprivation. It is hoped from His Highness the
Desired One, that this weak body which through the
effect of the long journey has come to the verge of complete
disintegration, may before the cessation of breath,
become so assisted as to throw itself upon the Dust of the
Holy Threshold. May this servant attain to a new life,
illumine his eyes, and transform his heart and spirit into
a rose garden and meadow, start on his journey to reach
the Abode of the Friend and haste from this to another
world.”   

###  5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Praises the Faith of German Bahá’ís 

In a Tablet revealed on the same date to Mírzá ‘Alí
Akbar he says about Germany: —   

“In short, Germany shall become illuminated; because
its inhabitants are religious and not submerged in the
sea of materialism. Those souls who travel along the
path of nature are like unto dead people; the breath of
life does not play upon them to any effect. Praise be to
God that you have become assisted in service and that
you have ignited the candle of guidance before the eyes
of all. It is hoped that most weighty results may become
apparent. {{p70}} The German believers are in a state of real
enkindlement; firm and steadfast in the Cause of God;
therefore their influence will be very great.”   

Today a letter was received from Mírzá Munír who
is in Ismailia, giving the news of the well-being of the
Master, and saying that he will soon send for us; he is
looking for a house large enough to accommodate all.
In the morning we called on Aḥmad Yazdí at his store;
in the afternoon Madame Stannard came to see us and
we talked a great deal about the probability of the Beloved’s
trip to India. She has lived in that country for a
long time, and is thoroughly familiar with the situation.   

Today several letters arrived from America imparting
cheer and happiness. Through the golden chain of correspondence
hearts are united even if seas and lands
separate them.   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 16, 1913. 

###  1. The Scope of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Talks in California 

Now that we are temporarily separated from the Beloved,
we occupy our time with the past, working upon
the notes of his American tour. I am copying all the
Master’s public and private talks given in California, so
that when I am with him, he may correct them for future
publication. The Master’s talks in California reached
the high water mark of his trip, showing the wonderful
versatility of his divine mind. {{p71}} During those days, a
flood of teachings was poured from his tongue, irrigating
the soil of hearts.   

###  2. The Program of a Day’s Activity in Port Sa‘íd 

Mírzá Maḥmúd is busy writing the diary of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s tour in America. Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar copies the
Tablets and addresses of the Beloved. He is eager to
have these heavenly words to read in the Bahá’í meetings
which he will attend on his way to Persia. For the present
our group consists of only these three persons. We
live very quietly. Seldom anything or anybody disturbs
‘the peacefulness of our abode. I get up at five o’clock
and after reading a few prayers, go out on the veranda
and look at the Mediterranean, sometimes perfectly calm,
and again rough. Then I work for an hour or two, till
my friends are awake. Mírzá Jamál, our Bahá’í cook, has
by this time prepared our breakfast, which consists of
tea, bread and cheese. Then we work again till noon,
and now and then one of us may go upon some errand
or to visit Aḥmad Yazdí’s store to receive the news. For
lunch, often we have bread, cheese, cantaloupe or watermelon,
and if not these, “abgousht” or “Persian stew.”
Our friends take a nap. I work. At four we have tea.
At six we take a walk and call on Madame Stannard at
the Eastern Exchange Hotel. Generally we are back by
eight. Between nine and ten we have our supper, sometimes
rice or meat. Then we sit on the veranda for about
an hour, speaking about the Cause, and enjoying the
moonlit night, then we return to our room to work until
eleven or twelve o’clock, after which we retire. This is
the program of our life for the present. {{p72}} A great contrast
to our strenuous activities in the West.   

###  3. Permission Comes to Visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Ismailia 

This morning Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh returned from Ismailia
with a package of Tablets from the Beloved for me to
translate. On the envelope the Master writes with his
own hand:   

“Translate these Tablets immediately. We hope soon
to rent a house. As soon as it is prepared, we will send
for you.”   

This message danced before my eyes and I started on
my translations. Our happiness was complete when
Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar brought us permission to leave for Ismailia
tomorrow, to spend the day. The anticipation of
meeting the Master gave us a new vigor and all day and
night we walked on a cloud of joy and happiness....
Mírzá Faḍl’u’lláh has received permission to leave tomorrow
for Persia.   

The following is the translation of a Tablet revealed
for the Persian believers on July 4th, which may be of
interest: —   

###  4. What Is Real Friendship 

O YE FRIENDS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ! Material friendship
is not permanent; for every kind of love which is not
purely for the sake of God is ended in hatred. Amity
which is not for the sake of the Lord, changeth into
enmity. But the divine friends are the faithful ones.
They are the consolation of the heart and the peace of my
spirit. They are spirit embodied, love personified, sincerity
incarnated, loyal friends and staunch lovers. {{p73}} Therefore
they are the cause of the happiness of the heart and
the soul.   

###  5. Prayer for the Friends 

“During this long journey, whenever the memory of
the friends crossed my mind, hardships were forgotten,
inconceivable joys were realized and vicissitudes and Inconveniences
changed into composure and tranquillity
Then I supplicated toward the Kingdom of Glory, saying:   

“‘O thou kind Beloved! Be thou the associate of the
hearts and the souls of the friends; send them at every
moment dew from the sea of thy bestowals; exhilarate
them every second with new wine and cause them to become
intoxicated with thy cup; so that they may take
the divine goblet in their hands, give the choice wine to
the seekers and confer the exhilaration of the wine of
‘Am I not your Lord?’ upon the wooers!”   

###  6. For Me to Be Silent, For You to Be Singing 

“In short, during this trip you were all with me and
were visible before my sight. In my wanderings, the
Melody of this divine bird reached the apex of heaven,
and the cry of “Ya Bahá’u’l-Abhá” was heard by the
people of the world. Now it is the turn of the believers
of God. I will be silent and they must sing with acclamation
and joy: — so that they may awaken the heedless
ones.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 17, 1913. 

To begin this day with thanksgiving on my lips and
in my heart, I will translate a Tablet revealed by the
Master many years ago to the Persian believers. It is
from one of the books of Siyyid Asadu’lláh.   

###  1. A Prayer of Illumination 

“I praise Thee, O Thou Remover of Sorrows, Overlooker
of faults, Rejoicer of hearts and Illuminator of
faces! Verily to the beloved ones at the door of Thy
oneness, the worthiest amongst Thy people, the noble
ones amongst Thy creatures and the righteous ones in
the congregation of Thy servants, are evidences of the
manifestation of Thy singleness. Verily Thou hast
chosen Thy believers for the sake of Thy Love, elected
them for Thy Knowledge, appointed them as the custodians
of Thy Mysteries and exalted them above all Thy
other servants, under all circumstances, and conditions.   

“O Lord! O Lord! Illumine their eyes with the beholding
of Thy Lights, refine their consciences with the
appearance of Thy Mysteries and enlighten their hearts
with the traces of Thy Names! Suffer them to become
the signs of Thy Unity, and the Banners of Thy singleness,
the stars of Thy Graces and the candles of Thy
Assemblages; so that they may arise to serve Thee and
be steadfast in Thy worship. Verily Thou art the Merciful,
the Giver, the Mighty and the Generous.   

###  2. The Dawn of the Sun of Reality 

“O ye kind friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! It is night. The
impenetrable darkness hath covered all regions, but the
hearts of the yearning ones are illumined and enlightened
by the rays of the Bestowal of the Clement. {{p75}} The effulgence
of the Morn of guidance is manifest and clear and
the brilliant rays of the Sun of Reality are diffused
throughout all Continents. The verses of the divine
Majesty of the Most Great Name are read by all the
people in all tongues; and through explanations, the evidences
and proofs of the Blessed Perfection are demonstrated.
The Melody of Holiness ascends to the etherial
sphere and the songs of Unity descend from the Kingdom
of Singleness. The Breezes of the most eminent
Guidance confer life, and the sweet Fragrances of the
Paradise of Abhá perfume this world and the world
beyond.   

###  3. People Are Heedless 

“Notwithstanding this effulgence and this diffusion of
the Fragrance of the Rose garden of the Covenant, innumerable
souls are yet afflicted with the sleep of negligence.
Their eyes are veiled and their nostrils do not
inhale its fragrant perfume. What negligence, what inadvertence,
what ignorance and what heedlessness is
this! Verily this is the condition of the deprived ones
in this Most Great Dispensation!   

###  4. The Duty of the Followers of Truth 

“But as regards you, turn your faces toward the Kingdom
of Abhá and join your voices in anthems of thanksgiving
and glorification! {{p76}} — that, praise be to God, the
Sun of Unity hath so illumined the hearts of the righteous
ones as to cause them to become the envy of the
dawning-places of light and this is only through His all-comprehending
Mercy and special Favor! Its source is:   

— ‘He chooseth for His Grace whomsoever he willeth,’
and its mainspring is: — ‘This is through the Bounty of
your Lord, He bestoweth on whomsoever He desireth.   

“Therefore, appreciate the value of the Most Great
Bestowal of this ineffable Grace, and of this manifest
Favor and Bounty which has been given to all the inhabitants
of the world; so that by this appreciation and
thankfulness the Mercy of the Peerless Lord may be increased,
the Ancient Grace be revealed in the hearts and
souls and spiritual outpouring be vouchsafed.   

“Upon ye be greeting and praise!   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

###  5. Our Journey to Ismailia 

As we were leaving this morning for Ismailia we arose
early. The train left at eight o’clock. In our company
there were several other Bahá’ís with their families who
planned to stop over at Ismailia to meet the Master and
then continue upon their journey to Cairo. All along the
road the mighty Canal joining the two seas was visible,
and now and then great ships passed before our eyes. On
the other side was the barren desert with its lack of vegetation.
We also passed by a great salt lake, the whiteness
of which dazzled us in the light of the sun. The train
stopped at many stations, allowing passengers to get on
or off as the case might be. By ten o’clock we reached
Ismailia. It has a small, up-to-date station. As it is
practically inhabited only by Europeans, it is one of the
cleanest spots in Egypt. It has, of course, an Arab
quarter, but in comparison with other Arab quarters I
have seen this one is quite clean. {{p77}} Ismailia is a new town.   

###  6. Visit to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Hotel Room 

As soon as we reached the station we hurried to the
hotel of J. Bosta. The first persons we met were Mírzá
Munír and <u>Kh</u>usraw, who have been fortunate enough
to be with the Master. One of them conducted us to
room 13 where the Beloved was living. When we entered
we found ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in bed in a weakened condition
He welcomed us and inquired about our health. One
of us had brought a package of letters and after a few
minutes it was delivered to him. For a while he read
them. There was one from an American believer (Miss
A. Boylan) announcing the sad news of the death of
her mother; another from India welcoming him to Egypt
and inviting him to visit the former country. There were
many more letters and cablegrams which for the present
were left unread.   

###  7. Formation of Habits 

He raised himself and sat up in bed. He complained
of the hardness of the cushions, saying, that when he
was in Paris one of the believers had brought him a soft
cushion and had urged him to put it under his head. He
had become accustomed to it, and as there was none in
the present hotel his neck consequently suffered pain all
night. He said it was very bad to become the slave of
habit, and that when he was young he often had a brick
or a piece of rock to rest upon and slept soundly.   

Ḥájí Níáz said he had a soft pillow with him and
begged to be allowed to go out and bring it. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would not have it, because he wished to get accustomed
again to his old habits. {{p78}} One must never habituate himself
to anything the absence of which may affect one’s
comfort.   

###  8. Bahá’u’lláh’s Life in the Persian Barrack of ‘Akká 

Then he related the story of Bahá’u’lláh’s cruel incarceration
in the barracks of ‘Akká, substantially as follows:   

When two years had passed, a regiment of soldiers
was assigned to ‘Akká. Of course there was only one
place for them to live and that was the barracks. Therefore
they had no alternative other than to turn out the
Bahá’í prisoners. At the time there was an inn in ‘Akká
which was inhabited by different people. In after years
this inn became an hospice for the pilgrims. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
went to the innkeeper, stating, that inasmuch as the
Bahá’ís were numerous and included several families, he
desired to rent the inn and if it were possible for the
present inmates to lodge themselves elsewhere.   

The innkeeper agreed to accept this offer, but when
after a few days he came back to draw up the papers
and to sign the document, the Master observed that one
of the rooms was still inhabited.   

“Who is here?” he asked.   

“It is the German Consul,” the innkeeper replied.   

“He must leave the premises, otherwise I will not rent
the place. It is impossible for an outsider to live here.”   

The innkeeper looked at him with ridicule and contempt.   

“Ha, ha!” he laughed. “And they say you are a prisoner!
You talk to me as though you are my lord and
master. What do you think, Mr. Prisoner! Do you expect
to get an exclusive palace in this prison town? Not
much, not much. This man is the German Consul. {{p79}} I
cannot drive him out.” To which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied:   

“There are many palaces in the outside world! If a
prisoner can find a palace in a prison town, he has indeed
accomplished something.”   

###  9. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Room in Prison 

Finally the German Consul left of his own accord,
only requesting the use of the room for two hours a day
so that he might attend to his official duties, to which
proposition ‘Abdu’l-Bahá consented cheerfully. Then the
Bahá’ís began to repair the rooms, but one of them had
to be left untouched because their funds were exhausted
The rooms were then assigned to the various families
and friends, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá chose the unrepaired one
for himself. This room was so damp that grass had
grown on the walls and there were several cracks in the
ceiling which gave free admittance to the rain. The
floor consisted of humid earth, and was a breeding place
for fleas.   

###  10. The Fleas of ‘Akká 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá had a mat and a long Persian fur coat.
The latter was his garment by day and his blanket by
night. When he covered himself with it, an army of
fleas, hiding in the ambuscade of fur, attacked him and
did their best to defeat him, but he outwitted them by
turning the coat and by using its other side. Then for an
hour he slept, until the wily, indomitable fleas would find
their way again to the inner side. Every night he had
recourse to this maneuvering eight or ten times, yet
notwithstanding this, he was by far happier and more
joyful then than at this time, sleeping on a fine bed in
the hotel.   

###  11. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Leaves for Alexandria 

Then to our surprise he informed us that he would
leave today for Ramleh, and stay there for one week.
If the weather agreed with him, he would send for us;
if not, he would return to Port Sa‘íd and together we
would all go to Haifa. {{p80}} Therefore at 2:30 P. M., accompanied
by Mírzá Munír and <u>Kh</u>usraw, he left for Alexandria
and Ramleh. The station master was a European,
and when the Beloved reached the station a few minutes
before time, he was conducted by him to his private
office to rest. When the train arrived, this station master
followed him very politely to the first class compartment.
This sign of distinction was great enough in the eyes
of the natives and officials of the railroad to excite their
wonder and curiosity. Then as the train pulled out from
the station we were once more separated from the Master.
Our train leaves for Port Sa‘íd at half-past nine, and
therefore we have several hours on our hands.   

###  12. Ismailia Is a Clean City 

In order to pass the time profitably we took in the
sights. There is a beautiful large park, lovely buildings,
clean avenues and many electric lights. I was quite surprised
at the size of the park with its big pine trees and
flowers. We saw also the native quarter. The goats,
the hens, the donkeys and the other animals live in the
same room with the Arabs, making a peaceful family.   

When we set our feet in the Port Sa‘íd station, familiar
faces greeted us. Aḥmad Yazdí, Ibrahim Effendi and
Áqá Jamál. They were, of course, surprised to hear
that the Master had left Ismailia, but they said quietly:
“He doeth whatsoever he willeth.”   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 18, 1913. 

###  1. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Bust, Made in Vienna, Is Sent to Port
Sa’íd 

I have no news to write. We did not hear anything
from Ramleh. It was a hot day so we stayed at home
and worked until 7 o’clock P. M. Then we paid a call
on Madame Stannard and returned by way of Aḥmad
Yazdí’s store. He had received the Master’s little bust
from Stuttgart. Mr. Herrigel has sent one to Mírzá
Maḥmúd and one to me. At present, mine is on my
writing table and is a reminder of his wondrous personality
and heavenly Love. “His spiritual face” is printed
on the Tablets of our hearts. We think of him and work
for him, for his spiritual face” is the Love of God, is
the Knowledge of God, is the Breath of the Holy Spirit,
is the Divine Inspiration and love for all mankind.   

###  2. A Prayer for the Success of the Bahá’ís 

The following is a prayer revealed from the tongue
of the Beloved many years ago: —   

“He is Glory, the Most Glorious!   

“O God! O God! Behold Thou these radiant faces
made joyous through the Fragrances of the flowers of
Thy Kingdom, El Abhá, and illumined with the lights
of Thy Supreme Concourse. Verily Thou seest that the
temples of the believers are stirred by the fresh breezes
of the Morning of Eternity and that the hearts of the
pure ones are attracted by the signs of the Sacred
Mysteries!   

“O Lord! Fill for them the cups of joy; enlighten
their faces by the rays emanating from the lamp of divine
prosperity; {{p82}} cause them to hear the sweet songs of the
birds of Holiness in the rose garden of Spiritual success;
gladden them by allowing them to listen to the melodies
of the Doves of light in the delectable heavenly fields,
and suffer them to enter into the Paradise of Abhá, Thy
Celestial Garden.   

“O My Lord! O My Lord! Intoxicate them with
the Wine of Knowledge, sweeten their taste with the
delicacies of prayer in the early morn and eve; gather
them together into one congregation; confer upon them
a shelter; protect them in the cause of Thy Covenant and
Testament; shield them from doubts and from the evil
suggestions of the waverers; make them Mines of Knowledge,
of Wisdom and of Assurance, cause their feet to
be firm and steady in the Straight Path, and grant unto
them prosperity in whatever country they call the people
to Thy Name! Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Cause
and Thou art Powerful to do whatsoever Thou desirest!   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

Here is another prayer. It may have been revealed for
the American believers.   

###  3. Prayer for Illumination 

“He is El Abhá! 

“O Thou Incomparable God! Make Thou these hearts
intimate with Thy Mystery; suffer them to be detached
from the known and from the unknown; cause them to
drink from the overflowing cup of the morn of Unity
and intoxicate them with the wine of ‘Am I not your
Lord?’   

“O Lord! These servants are captivated by Thee.
These longing ones are attracted and enthralled by Thy
Beauty. {{p83}} They are wanderers about Thy abode; lovers
of Thy Countenance, and the flocks of gazelles of Thy
meadow.   

“O Lord! We are stumbling in the desert of remoteness
and are scattered in the valley of deprivation! Send
Thou to us the Messenger of Providence and the Angel
of Guidance: — so that the Fragrance of Thy Garden may
reach unto our nostrils, the refulgent light of Thy
Countenance illumine the ‘house of sorrows’ of these
grief-stricken people; the darkness of night be changed
into the sunlight of day and the thorny place of regret
transformed into the garden of hope. Verily Thou art
the Mighty, the Seer and the Hearer!   

“O ye believers of God! Rejoice in the Most Eminent
Bounty of your Lord! Be happy; for the Favors of
the Glad-tidings of the King of the Kingdom are unlimited.
Be ye prepared for the downpouring of the
Cloud of Mercy. Upon you be the Bestowals of your
Lord, the Ancient! Dilate your breasts, increase your
fervor, exalt your ambition, add to your yearning, and be
rejoiced in heart, for God hath chosen you from amongst
His creatures, for the sake of His Love. Verily He is
Merciful and Clement to you.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

I bring this day to a close by translating another Tablet
revealed to an American Bahá’í several years ago: —   

###  4. The Covenant Is a Lamp 

“O thou spiritual leaf, which is verdant and fresh
through the downpourings of the Kingdom of God!   

“Verily I pray at the Threshold of God, the Mighty
the Powerful, that He may illumine thy heart with the
light emanating from the height of the kingdom, cause
thy tongue to speak the praise of the Living, Self-subsistent,
Eternal Lord, and suffer thee to become a light
shining with the rays of Knowledge, so that thou mayst
enlighten those vast cities and great states.   

“Verily, Verily, I say unto thee, the Covenant of God
and His Testament is a lamp with world-illuminating
rays which from the Supreme Concourse enlightens the
horizons of the earth and heaven. {{p84}} Whosoever stations
himself before this divine light, will be illumined with
Manifest Glory, his speech will become effective in the
hearts and spirits, and God will reinforce him with a
power which will penetrate through the realities of all
things. Upon thee be Bahá!   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 19, 1913. 

###  1. Arrival of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Ramleh 

This morning we received a short note from Mírzá
Munír telling us about the safe arrival of the Master
in Ramleh where he has taken rooms in the Hotel Victoria.
Unfortunately owing to the fatigue of the journey
and to the recurrence of fever, he had not been
sleeping well at night. On the way they had met Siyyid
Jalál who was also going to Ismailia to meet the Beloved.   

Toward evening I called on Mrs. Stannard. She read
me a letter, just received from Miss Hiscock of New
York, who has been living in Ramleh for two or three
years. {{p85}} She spoke of her happiness on hearing of the arrival
of the Master. Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl has already called
on him and she and other friends intend to avail themselves
of the first opportunity to do the same.   

The Master has sent one of the Bahá’ís, Siyyid Yaḥyá,
to Haifa to accompany his daughter, Rúḥá <u>Kh</u>ánum,
back to Alexandria.... A house will be rented in Ramleh,
and in a few days we will be on our way to join the
Spiritual Caravan.   

###  2. The Presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Holds the People
Together 

When the Master leaves a place all the different elements
which have been holding together are seemingly
scattered; the collected individualities regain their entities
each person follows his own inclination; one feels that
something is lacking, for the touchstone of life has gone
the great social leveler has disappeared. The “I” and
the “MY” stalk abroad. Futile conversation and bickering,
sneak around the corner and if encouraged, step
boldly in to the courtyard and to the private chamber.
We must ever gaze toward the sun of Universal Fellowship,
otherwise we will dissipate our forces.   

This morning I was reading the diary of the Master’s
voyage on the steamer Cedric from Alexandria to New
York. Omitting the usual details and descriptions of
the trip, I have chosen a few selections from his talks
with different travelers which have a general bearing
upon his expected arrival in America.   

###  3. Brahma, Krishna and Buddha Taught the Oneness
of God 

It is the third day of the trip. An American, after
hearing the Master’s teachings on reincarnation, goes

to his cabin and carries to him an idol worshiped in
China and Japan. {{p86}} The Master holds it in his hand and
remarks: —   

What vast difference exists between the souls of mankind!
One retrogrades to such a low level as to worship
statues and stone idols: forms which are devoid of spirit
and reason, while God hath conferred upon him reason
and adorned his shoulders with the mantle of spiritual
attributes! Another soars to such a high summit of perfection
and perspicacity as to become the Sign of God
and the Instructor of humanity. Brahma, Krishna and
Buddha never advocated polytheism. They were eminent
teachers of monotheism as were all the other prophets
of God; but succeeding generations misconstrued
their words and in order to further their own selfish interests
fabricated these false doctrines.   

###  4. The Law of Change is Universal 

On the sixth day he spoke to a group of passengers as
follows: —   

“All created phenomena are subject to the law of
change and transmutation. Youth is followed by old
age; a tender plant grows into an aged tree; dynasties
are born, wax strong, reach to the zenith of glory and
then totter to the ground. Likewise every one of the
world religions has been a cause of progress and advancement
in its own time, but now they have become as very
old trees, and do not yield any more luscious fruits.
Some people persist in the unscientific belief that these
very old trees will again become young and push forth
leaves, blossoms and fruits. This is impossible. {{p87}} This
age needs a young sapling with universal growing capacity.
Are you informed of such a plant?   

###  5. In the Bahá’í Cause No One Holds Religious Offices,
Titles and Ceremonies 

On the eighth day, he speaks to the Persians: —

The Blessed Perfection has torn up the root of the
tree of superstition and religious offices. In the past the
the ignorance and the retrogression of nations. In this
Cause there is no religious title, no ceremony of ordination.
One is not respected simply because one wears a
peculiar dress or has been given a religious title or has
inherited one from Patriarchs of the Church. No! These
are not marks of distinction.   

###  6. Who Are the Sanctified Souls? 

“On the other hand, there are holy souls, the signs of
whose divine sanctity and spirituality become apparent in
the hearts of others. People are unconsciously attracted
to them through their pure morality, their justice and
loving kindness. Everyone is drawn to them on account
of their praiseworthy attributes and pleasing qualities
and all faces are illumined by the light of their virtue
and integrity. In this Movement there is no title to be
given to anyone, and no position to be inherited. ‘The
hands of the Cause’ are the hands of Truth. Therefore
whosoever is the promoter and the servant of the Word
of God, is the hand of Truth. By ‘the hands of God’
certain definite spiritual meanings are conveyed. It is
not only a verbal expression. The more a man is humble
in the Cause of God, the more he is confirmed; and the
more he is evanescent, the more he is favored.”   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 20, 1913. 

###  1. Who is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá? 

The heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the fountain of life out
of which flows the Water of Truth. Are you thirsty?
His Universal Teaching is divine Food descending from
the exalted heaven of the Will of God. Are you hungry?
His utterances are the roses and anemones of the garden
of Abhá. Do you love flowers? His words are the
brilliant stars of the firmament of spiritual Glory. Are
not the stars beautiful? His presence inspires confidence,
manhood, loyalty and uprightness. Should you not characterize
yourselves with these attributes? His Ideals are
fresh breezes heralding the approaching dawn of the
springtime of human regeneration. Are you stirred into
gladsome life? His message is the sweet melody of the
Kingdom of Abhá. Do you listen to the soul-enrapturing
strains? His pathway is the pathway, leading the
traveler to the ultimate reality. Are you ready to walk
in it?   

###  2. A Catholic Procession in the Streets of Port Sa‘íd 

Today the French inhabitants had a gorgeous religious
procession which started from their church. All the
streets through which it passed were adorned with flags,
bunting and Japanese lanterns. The priests were dressed
in their pompous surplices of red, gold and silver. There
were long lines of young girls dressed as angels, also a
company of choir boys. {{p89}} The procession was brought to
an end by a large statue of the Virgin Mary, holding the
child, Jesus, in her arms. Of course thousands of Arabs
left their work to gaze at this very spectacular sight of
what they called “idol worship,” and not understanding
the sacredness of these symbols, they poked fun and
laughed in their sleeves. How sad is the ignorance of
humanity!   

I will continue to translate a few more sayings of the
Beloved when on the steamer Cedric.   

###  3. First Journey of the Persians to America 

Ninth day: — “Formerly it was most difficult to cross
the Atlantic and up to this time few travelers with our
aims and intentions have gone from Persia to America.
There are some who have visited the United States, but
it has been either for personal affairs or for the transaction
of business. One can therefore say, that this is
the first disinterested journey of a group of Persians to
America. Our great hope is in the divine Confirmations
through which all doors will be opened to us. Today the
nations of the world can be conquered by divine Power,
and this divine Power revolves around the servants of
the Blessed Perfection. All personal interests must disappear
beside this wondrous Aim.”   

Eleventh day. — “I go to America on account of the
invitations of the American Peace Societies and the urgent
appeals of my friends, because the objects of this
Cause are universal Peace, the oneness of the world of
humanity and perfect equality between all mankind. As
this century is the century of light and the cycle of the
revelation of Mysteries, undoubtedly these glorious aims
will be fully established, and the influence of this great
Cause will encircle the East and the West.”   

###  4. Material and Spiritual Food 

Twelfth day: — At the table the Master speaks about
simple diet: how much better it is for one’s constitution
to eat one or two courses. {{p90}} One of the American Bahá’ís
asks Him if he will not prescribe a simple recipe of dieting
for the believers upon His arrival in America. He
laughs heartily and says: —   

“We do not interfere with their material food, but we
will give them a simple recipe of spiritual food. This is
our work.”   

###  5. Steam a Marvelous Energy 

Sixteenth day: — <q class="abd">“We will be only one more day on
the steamer. In reality steam is a marvelous energy.
Were it not for this power, how could we cross the
Atlantic Ocean? What a wonderful means of transportation
God has prepared for us and how the Blessed
Perfection has confirmed us! Otherwise what relation
between America and Persia!”</q>   

###  6. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Welcome to New York 

Seventeenth day: — Great skyscrapers are visible in the
distance. The Goddess of Liberty holds aloft her lamp.
The Master walks up on the deck watching with great
interest the shifting scenes; hundreds of Bahá’ís are impatiently
waiting on the pier. He talks with the Persians: —   

“When we embarked on the steamer in Alexandria no
one dreamed that we should reach America in such safety,
and cross the Atlantic with such ease.”   

Now the steamer docks in its berth; the Bahá’ís on the
pier wave their handkerchiefs and hats; The Desire of
their hearts is not seen from the dock; {{p91}} he is in his cabin
surrounded by a number of newspapermen. Patiently
‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives interviews to each, answering ever
question and satisfying all. Here I will translate one of
the many beautiful interviews. It is the shortest.   

###  7. Interview with the newspapermen on the Steamer Deck 

“What are your aims?” the reporter asks. 

“Our aims,” he answers, “are Universal Peace and the
Oneness of the world of humanity. Last year I visited
London and Paris. This year I have come to America
to meet the lovers of Peace, perchance we may find a basis
or cooperation. It is my hope that the American Peace
Societies may consolidate their forces, and thus, shoulder
to shoulder, may render an effective service to humankind.   

“How will Universal Peace be established?”   

“By educating the public with the sentiments of Peace.
Today the full realization of Universal Peace is a panacea
for every social disease.”   

“What are these diseases?”   

“One of the diseases is the poverty of the middle classes
through the unbearable burden of war taxation. This
craze for militarism has reached its height and shall soon
recede. The income of the farmer and of others is taken
by the power of a military government and foolishly
expended upon useless implements of destruction. The
prospect becomes gloomier every year because the war
budget of every nation is being increased without any regard
to the feverish signs of social unrest and industrial
upheaval. The people are seething with ideas of insurrection
and agitation. Their burden has become too heavy
and their patience is exhausted. They groan under this
load, and grope in the darkness, seeking the light of
Peace. Their pitiful cries ascend to the throne of the
Almighty. {{p92}} Lo, lo! He has listened to them; He has
answered their prayers. The dawn of Peace has appeared,
the lights of brotherhood are breaking through
the foul clouds of human prejudices. Lovers of Peace.
Rejoice! rejoice! O ye who are heavy laden, be happy,
be happy! Weep no more, for your burden will be taken
away from you.   

“This military and naval expenditure is a great disease.
Look at the result of the war between Italy and
Turkey! How dreadful! There exists a reign of Terror.
Fathers weep for their sons; sons weep for their
fathers. How many peaceful villages are laid waste!
How the wealth of the nations is exhausted! The remedy
for this disease is through Universal Peace. This will
insure public security! Today that which is the cause
of dispersion is war. If the nations enter into a faithful
agreement to at once lay armaments aside, they shall
secure for themselves and their posterity eternal welfare;
they shall become freed from every difficulty and from
international confusion. This end must be attained
through the development of minds and hearts and by inculcation
of peaceful ideals in all the institutions of
modern civilization.”   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 21, 1913. 

###  1. There Is No Diary of Bahá’u’lláh’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Words during the Long Years of Incarceration 

Aside from the impression that the Beloved will stay
in Ramleh and not go to Haifa, there is no news. {{p93}} We
are anxiously waiting to receive the word for our departure.
Not only do I miss the glory of his presence,
but so much of his wonderful words of light and guidance
are lost because there is no one to report them. The
art of diary writing is comparatively unknown in the
East. The believers have not been accustomed to it. For
example, throughout the life of Bahá’u’lláh and during
that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá until the present no one dreamed of
reporting their sayings. I have not yet seen a book or
pamphlet, biographic in tone and diary-like in construction
The recent Persian pilgrims, learning this from
the West would whenever they were summoned to the
presence of the Beloved, beg either Mírzá Maḥmúd or
myself to go with them and report the Master’s words.
We were really stenographers, and our services were
much in demand. Had the Master lived in America for
the last forty years, there would besides his Tablets have
been volumes of memoirs and diaries written by those
who were fortunate enough to be near him.   

While we are waiting patiently to receive his command,
we are not idle. The calmness and sweetness of the
Peace which passeth all understanding wafts over our
minds and hearts, and in this temporary separation we
have experienced that deeper spiritual union which will
more and more be realized as time goes on.   

###  2. Teaching the Cause Is the Most Important of All
Services 

Just as the Master has sacrificed everything in his life
in order to spread the Fragrances of the Paradise of
Abhá, just as the Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh is his guardian
and protector, so likewise must we forget all other
thoughts and occupy ourselves with those matters which
pertain to the exaltation of the word of God among mankind,
and be confident that the Blessed Perfection, under
all circumstances, will sustain and reinforce us. {{p94}} At the
present time the promulgation of the Teachings is of
paramount importance because the Power of the Supreme
Concourse is behind it.   

In a Tablet revealed by the Beloved many years ago,
to the Persian friends, He says: —   

“O ye believers of God! Supplicate and entreat at the
Threshold of the Almighty that He may confirm you in
the diffusion of the Fragrances of Holiness which are
wafting from the direction of the Garden of God. Blow
ye over all creation like the Breezes of the early morn and
impart ye a freshness and verdancy through the Power of
Truth upon the flowers, the sweet hyacinths and the roses
of the garden of existence. This is the quintessence of
the meeting and the superlative degree of success and
prosperity, for it causes the attainment of man unto the
kingdom of Abhá, attracts him to the Sacred Court of
His Highness the Almighty and suffers him to reach the
Sublime Presence of the Powerful, the Omnipotent
Lord.”   

The translation of another dynamic Tablet to the Persian
believers, revealed likewise many years ago, may be
of interest: —   

###  3. It Is the Day of Action and Happiness 

“O ye merciful friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! Although it
is night, yet it is the morn of the dawn of the divine
Kingdom. Lights are shining and faces are radiant.
The Ancient Bestowal of the Beauty of Abhá is the Companion
of every pure heart and the Effulgence of the
Manifestation of the Mount of Sinai is the associate
of every firm and steadfast one. {{p95}} The soul-entrancing
Melody of the Blessed Perfection is heard from the Invisible
World by every upright and righteous person,
and His Glad-tidings and gospels of joy bestow undeniable
Favor. The Fame of His greatness hath filled
all regions and the songs of the birds of the meadow of
His Reality confer spirit upon all the inhabitants of the
globe.   

“Consequently, we must send forth a joy-cry and
through the Power of God infuse a mighty thrill of
spiritual emotion through the pillars of this mortal world
Eternal Life must be revealed in this mundane existence
heavenly Grace must become apparent and the Everlasting
Bounty of the Paradise of Abhá must adorn this
earth. How long this silence! How long this speechlessness!
How long this lukewarmness! The flaming torch
of the burning Fire of God is set aglow on the apex
of the world and the lighted candle of guidance is a witness
in the gatherings. If we are not enkindled with the
heat of this divine flame, with what heart-burning fire
will we then be lighted! If we are not intoxicated with
this Wine of God, what kind of wine, then, will exhilarate
us! If in the Assemblage of Transfiguration we do
not forget ourselves, becoming joyous and enraptured
then in what gathering will we make tumult and acclamation.
O ye divine friends! The Call is the Call of the
Beauty of Abhá, streaming down from the Invisible
Kingdom! The Melody is the Melody of the Supreme
Concourse, be ye happy, be ye joyous, be ye exultant,
be ye glad!   

“Upon ye be greetings and praises.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 22, 1913. 

###  1. The Spiritual Lesson Drawn from the Material
Progress of Port Sa‘íd and the Suez Canal 

The material progress of Port Sa‘íd is a great lesson
for all the Bahá’ís. {{p96}} Forty years ago there were only a
handful of dingy hovels with half-naked Arabs. There
was no trade, there were no houses, and no communication
existed with the outside world. Almost all the area
on which the present up-to-date city with its 60,000 busy
inhabitants is built, is land reclaimed from the sea. When
the Suez Canal joined the two mighty oceans together,
Port Sa‘íd became an international port, and from that
date the magical progress of the city continued uninterruptedly.
Just as God inspired the heart and mind of
DeLesseps with this most wonderful thought of joining
the two seas, in like manner, Our Beloved, as a spiritual
Engineer, is appointed by Bahá’u’lláh to unite the East
and the West. The concerted efforts of thousands of
laborers made possible the realization of the Suez Canal,
and thus the greatest engineering feat up to that time
was accomplished. Similarly the united zeal and endeavor
of all the Bahá’ís are needed to join together the
mighty seas of humanity. This is not child’s play. This
is a stupendous undertaking. Could the laborers complete
the Canal if they sat around and criticized one another?
Let us be faithful in our enterprise, and work to the end;
let no harsh words discourage us, let us leave behind fruitless
discussions, and engage in that whereby the Word
of God may be promoted and the Fragrances of the
Cause diffused. Thus we may bring happiness to the
heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. {{p97}} Let us look forward, and not
backward; heavenward and not earthward. Bahá’u’lláh
will assist us. The Canal will be completed and there
Will be witnessed the Confluence of the seas. Then the
two mighty oceans of the human families — East and
West — which are being stirred at the present time by
the contrary winds of conflicting prejudices, shall be
joined together. There will be millions of laborers in
the future; but we must hold the breach honorably until
they arrive! God does not need our services, but we are
in need of His continued Graces. He is the most Potent!
He can wait. A thousand years in His sight, is as one
day. If, through our negligence and inadvertence, we
retard His work, we are the losers. He will raise other
generations to fulfill His command. He will inspire
other hearts to proclaim His words. He will illumine
other minds to grasp His ultimate plan. He will reinforce
other armies to achieve His triumph. He will instruct
other nations to magnify His name. We must
not let this matchless opportunity escape us! The tool is
his who can handle it.   

About six o’clock we left our apartment in search of
news. The headquarters of news is Aḥmad Yazdí’s
store, so thither our feet directed us. There to our surprise
and delight we found Ḥájí Siyyid Javád and Rúḥí
Effendi, just arrived from Haifa at the bidding of the
Master. The former is an old Bahá’í of the time of
Bahá’u’lláh and has an interesting history as a background;
the latter is the grandson of the Master. He is
about 13 years old, the son of Mírzá Musin.

###  PORT SA‘ÍD, EGYPT, JULY 23, 1913. 

###  1. Possible Departure for Ramleh Makes Us Happy 

I feel that the Beloved will call us to him before the
end of this month. I have heard that two houses are
rented, one for himself and his family; the other for
the secretaries, etc. The houses are near each other.
This has indeed lifted our spirits, and has made us decidedly
cheerful; now we sing as we work. Mírzá ‘Alí
Akbar whistles Russian songs; Mírzá Maḥmúd chants
Persian poems, and my choice, strange to say, falls to
American music. We do not refer to this great change — but as we look at each other, the joy in our eyes
speaks volumes. After all, environment plays a large part
in shaping our thoughts and aspirations. However, the
Master is teaching us to live above environment, and not
to let our minds be colored by the changing film of
events.   

This morning Ḥájí Siyyid Javád and Rúḥí Effendi
came to call, and we welcomed them with Bahá’í cordiality.
Ḥájí Javád gave me a short account of his trips
to ‘Akká to see Bahá’u’lláh during the early days of His
imprisonment. Javád is an old gentleman, he is tall,
with a short white beard, and has a fund of reminiscences
of the days of the Blessed Perfection. {{p98}}  

###  2. Arrival of Mrs. Getsinger 

After five o’clock we sauntered out toward Aḥmad
Yazdí’s store, and it was with genuine satisfaction that
we met Mrs. Getsinger, who had landed two hours before.
She was well and happy, and overflowing with the
joyful anticipation of meeting the Master. {{p99}} Strange
enough a telegram was received from the Master within
an hour, giving her permission to leave the next morning
for Ramleh.   

###  3. Translation of an Interview between ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and the Reporter of the “San Francisco Examiner” 

I would now like to translate from my Persian notes
a most interesting interview between a correspondent of
the Examiner and the Master in San Francisco. The
date is October 3rd, 1912. The hour is about eight P.M.
This fine interview appeared the next day in a most crude
form, almost unrecognizable: —   

Correspondent: “Are you pleased with the United
States?”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: <q class="abd">“The Continent of America is most
progressive. The means of instruction are prepared;
the educational institutions are thoroughly equipped and
the pupils are being systematically trained and educated.
Its wealth is on an upward tendency. Its government
is democratic. Its advancement unceasing. Its nation
hospitable. Its people loyal, energetic and noble. Its inhabitants
free and lovers of liberty. Its men civilized and
its women cultured, refined and idealistic. On the other
hand, all these advantages are on the objective plane and
I observe that the majority of the people are submerged
n a sea of materialism and agnosticism. Its material
civilization is well nigh perfect, but it is in need of the
civilization of heaven divine civilization.”</q>   

Correspondent: “What do you mean by divine civilization?”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: <q class="abd"> “Divine Civilization is the light. Material
civilization is the lamp. Material civilization is
the body; In itself it is not sufficient, and humanity, from
every point of view, stands in need of divine civilization.
Natural civilization produces material welfare and prosperity;
divine civilization develops man’s ideal virtues.
Natural civilization serves the physical world; Divine
Civilization serves the world of morality. {{p100}} Divine Civilization
is a symposium of the perfections of the world
of humanity. Divine Civilization is the improvement of
the ethical life of a nation. Divine Civilization is the
discovery of the Reality of phenomena. Divine Civilization
is spiritual philosophy. Divine Civilization is
Knowledge of God with rational and intellectual evidences.
Divine Civilization is Eternal Life. Divine Civilization
is the immortality of the soul. Divine Civilization is
the breath of the Holy Spirit. Divine Civilization is
heavenly wisdom. Divine Civilization is the Reality of
the Teachings of all the ancient prophets. Divine Civilization
is Universal Peace and the Oneness of the world
of humanity. The Holy Manifestations of God have
been the founders of Divine Civilization, the first teachers
of mankind and the spreaders of the fragrances of
holiness and sanctity amongst the children of men.” </q>   

Correspondent: “Are you satisfied with the American
people?”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: <q class="abd"> “The Americans are a kind, and affectionate
people. All nations are welcomed in their midst.
They give to every one the right of living and allow each
to seek happiness in his own way. Here no one feels
a foreigner. I am most pleased with them.” </q>   

Correspondent: “I have heard that you advocate the
complete equality of men and women. This radical
teaching coming from an Oriental thinker, is of great
interest and supreme significance. Just at this juncture
the Californian women are clamoring for the right to
vote for all the National and State officials, and your
opinion on this important question would be greatly appreciated
by the people.”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: <q class="abd"> “The question of equality between men
and women has made greater advancement in America
than anywhere else, and day by day it is assuming more
importance and coming nearer to its full realization.
However, so long as complete equality does not exist between
men and women, the world of humanity will not
make extraordinary progress. {{p101}} The woman is an essential
column, while the man is also an essential column
If we aim to have a lasting building, the foundations of
both columns must be laid very deep. Women are the
first teachers of the children. They instruct them and
inculcate morality in their minds and hearts. Later these
children attend schools and universities for higher education
and specialization. Now if the teacher or instructor
is deficient, how can the scholar be properly trained?
Therefore, it is proven that the culture and development
of men will be intensified and will attain perfect fruition
when women have equal opportunities with them. Consequently,
the women must enjoy all the learning they are
able to assimilate, so that they may reach to the level of
men. The same privileges and opportunities must be conferred
upon both; so that, just as they share life and its
responsibilities, they may also share the same virtues of
the world of humanity. Undoubtedly partnership in
education and culture presupposes equality in rights.
The world of humanity has two wings, one the male, the
other the female. Both wings have to become strong so
that mankind may soar to the empyrean of its destined
perfection; for if one wing is left weak, the upward
flight must from necessity be slow. God has created
both human. They enjoy in common all the faculties
No one iS endowed with special privileges. How can we
make a distinction which is unknown in the sight of God?
We must follow the policy of God. Moreover, there are
male and female in the vegetable kingdom. They are
on equal footing. {{p102}} Inherently they enjoy suffrage and
there is no distinction between them. Likewise in the
animal kingdom, the right of suffrage and equality is
enjoyed without any feeling of superiority or privilege.
Therefore it is admitted that there is no distinction of
gender in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, although
they are deprived of reasonableness and have not the
distinguishing faculties. But we, who are confirmed
with the bestowal of reason, and who enjoy all the characteristics
which distinguish man from the animal, how
can we act in this manner, and build these false barriers?
Many women have appeared who have won for themselves
fame and name by the versatility of their thoughts.
Amongst the Bahá’í women a number have shown remarkable
talent for literature, science and art, and have
rendered distinct services in all the departments of life.” </q>   

<q class="abd"> “In history many capable women have displayed special
genius for government and political administration,
like Semiramis; Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, and Queen
Victoria of England. In the religious world the Israelites
wandered for forty years in the wilderness and could not
conquer the Holy Land. Finally a woman achieved this
signal victory. In the dispensation of Christ, the apostles
became confused; even Peter denied Him thrice, but Mary
of Magdala became the cause of their firmness and steadfastness.
In the religion of Bahá’u’lláh, Qurratu’l-Ayn,
and many other Persian women, demonstrated their
knowledge and wisdom to such an extent that even the
men were astonished and listened with deference to their
advice and counsel.” </q>   

Correspondent: “What is your object in coming to
America?”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: <q class="abd"> “I have come to America to promote
the ideal of Universal Peace and the solidarity of the
human race. {{p103}} I have not come for pleasure, or as a
tourist.” </q>   

Correspondent: “What do you think about woman’s
fashions?”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: <q class="abd"> “We do not look upon the dresses of
women, whether they are of the latest mode. We are not
the judge of fashion. We consider rather the wearer of
the dress. If she is chaste, if she is pure, if she is cultured,
if she is characterized with heavenly morality and
if she is favored at the Threshold of God, she is honored
and respected by us, no matter what manner of dress
she wears. We have nothing to do with the ever-changing
world of mode and picture hats” </q>   

Correspondent: “What is the greatest thing you have
seen in America?”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: <q class="abd"> “The greatest thing I have seen in
America is its Freedom. In reality this is a free nation
and a democratic government.” </q>   

Correspondent: “What is your opinion about Turkey
and the Balkan war?”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: <q class="abd"> “We have nothing to do with war. We
are advocates of Peace. Speak to us about the conditions
of Peace. Go to the diplomatists and militarists and ask
their opinions about this war. But as regards Peace:
In the world of humanity there is no more important
affair, no weightier cause. It is conducive to the well-being
of the world of creation; the means of the
prosperity of nations, the reason of eternal friendship between
peoples, the cause of solidarity between the East
and the West, the promoter of real freedom and the most
eminent Favor of His Highness the Almighty. {{p104}} We
must all strive to upraise the Flag of International Peace,
the Oneness of the world of humanity, and the spiritual
brotherhood of mankind.” </q>   

The correspondent tried to ask a few more questions
but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá interrupted him by this final statement,
while putting his hand on his shoulder and kissing his
face: —   

“Consider how much I love thee and to what extent
I respect Mr. Hearst that, notwithstanding the fatigue
coming over me as the result of a very busy day, I have
answered all thy questions.”   

Thus the young man left the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
with a sense of awe and respect that one feels only when
one is saturated with the holy atmosphere which is created
wherever he is — the Center of Spirituality and heavenliness.   

------

###  PORT SA‘ÍD. EGYPT, JULY 24, 1913. 

###  1. Our Departure for Ramleh 

The Port Sa‘íd believers have gone to the station to
say good-by to Ḥájí Siyyid Javád, Rúḥí Effendi and
Mrs. Getsinger who are leaving today for Ramleh to be
honored with the blessing of the Beloved’s presence. I
am with them too. The train leaves at eight A.M. They
are very happy. The train pulls out of the station, and
we return home in the heat of the sun to spend another
day in quiet work and uninterrupted solitude. I sit at
my table, Mírzá Maḥmúd at his and Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar
in his room is copying the addresses of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, when
the door opens and Áqá ‘Azíz enters. He looks at me
and smiles. Like a flash of lightning his thought is transferred
to me. I get up from my seat:   

“Have you any news for us from the Master?” I ask.   

“Yes,” he quietly answers. {{p105}} “Aḥmad Yazdí has just
now received a telegram giving you permission to leave
for Ramleh.”   

We are very happy. We must leave by the one o’clock
train. In half an hour all our baggage is prepared.
What spiritual ecstasy! What divine beatitude! We go
to Aḥmad Yazdí’s store to thank him personally for this
good news. Returning home we finish our work and at
a quarter after twelve start for the station. There, to
our surprise, we find Aḥmad Yazdí who has come to say
good-by to us.   

###  2. Thinking over Meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

Finally everything is ready; the first and second bell
rings, and the train starts. In our hearts the birds of
joy sing; behind us the pleasant memories of more than
a month, all about the sandy, quiet desert — the garden of
Alláh; ahead of us union — with whom? — With the
Beloved of our hearts. As I sat in our compartment
contemplating the love of the Master, my eyes were filled
with tears of joy and I realized more than ever — and
no doubt thousands have had this same experience — hat
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is our Beloved, our Hope, our Desire, the
sum-total of all our longings. If one has ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
for his Beloved, his happiness is not dimmed; his peace
is not broken; his faith can move mountains and all his
aspirations are fulfilled! O Joy of Joy! O Heavenly
Light! O Love Divine! Art Thou not the most beautiful,
the most satisfying, the most ennobling, the most
rapturous! Would I not gladly dedicate my whole life to
treasure Thee in the secret chamber of my heart? Thou
art the Poet of transmutation. Thou art the Philosopher’s
stone. Thou art the remedy for all sorrows! O
Love! O God! {{p106}} O Unchanging Lord! sustain us, feed
us with thy ambrosial food; suffer us to drink from thy
diamond cup of pure affection. We feel throughout our
whole body the spiritual thrills of thy compassion and
mercy.   

###  3. Scenes Along the Railroad 

By this time we reach Ismailia, the small clean town,
blessed by the presence of our Beloved. After a few
minutes, the train starts again. The country is fresh and
green from the unfailing blessing of the Nile; the palm
trees are laden with bunches of green dates, the cotton
belt is extensive and the reports are that this year’s crop
is excellent. As the train passes on we see hundreds of
men and women working in the fields, camels are grazing,
and there are many cows and sheep. Rice also is cultivated
in this part of the country. At 4.30 P.M. we reach
Benha where we have to change trains, and after thirty
minutes we are again on our way. It is 7.30 when we
enter the station of Sidi Gaber, and here Ḥájí <u>Kh</u>urasání
and Mírzá Munír are present to welcome and guide us
to our new quarters. On the way our train had crossed
the noble Nile. It is spanned by a most excellent iron
bridge. Toward sunset, the men and women farmers — Fellaheen — showing their religious spirit, leave their
work and perform their ablutions and prayers wherever
they happen to be. It is a most divine picture to see
these simple people praying to their Maker under the
open sky. Another lovely scene which is truly Biblical,
is the procession of women with jars on their heads, leaving
their curious mud-built villages to fill them at the
spring.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Calls on Us 

Ramleh is a modern Egyptian town with all the conveniences
of western civilization. {{p107}} It is a summer resort
for the most important European officials in the service
of the Egyptian Government, and also for the native
Pá<u>sh</u>ás. There are lovely parks, all kinds of hotels and
splendid houses. We have a nice furnished apartment
about two hundred yards from the residence of the Beloved.
At eight o’clock he came to welcome us and our
joy at again looking upon his benign face, knew no
bounds.   

He had just returned from calling upon Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl. He inquired about our health, and after a few
more questions, left us, but the happiness of those minutes
will remain in our hearts. During the last days
while the Beloved was living in the Victoria Hotel, many
English officials, native Pá<u>sh</u>ás, and Arab <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s have
called upon him, and on many occasions more than twenty
of these important men would gather in the salon to
listen to his talks. None of these are preserved. There
is a weekly meeting at the house of Ḥájí <u>Kh</u>urasání and
the Master attended it. At present Túbá <u>Kh</u>ánum, the
Master s daughter, with her son Rúḥí and Mrs. Getsinger,
are staying in the house of the Beloved.   

I will end this letter by the translation of two quotations
from Tablets: —   

###  5. Real Love Attracts Divine Confirmations 

“If thou desirest to be confirmed in the service of the
Kingdom of God, live in accord with the Teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh, and that is: real love for the world of humanity,
and the utmost of kindness for the believers of
God. {{p108}} This real love, like unto magnetic power, attracts
divine Confirmations.”   

###  6. Teach the Cause Through Deeds 

“If a soul calls the people to the Kingdom of God according
to the Principles of Bahá’u’lláh, there will be
many listeners. First, one may teach by deeds, then speak
the word. First, one must become thirsty, then the salubrious
water may be offered. No matter how delicious
the water is, one who is not thirsty will not enjoy it.
Therefore, make ye an effort, so that the people may become
thirsty; then enable them to quaff from this divine
Chalice.”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, JULY 25, 1913. 

###  1. A Call in Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl 

This morning the Beloved visited our apartment and
sat on the Veranda. He is trying to find a house in
Ramleh for Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl, so that he may be near
us. After a few moments he went out with Ḥájí Muḥammad
to look for one. We learned later that a house has
been found almost adjacent so that we shall have the
privilege of seeing Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl quite often.   

In the afternoon Ḥájí <u>Kh</u>urasání came and expressed
a wish to call on Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl. Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar
and myself begged him to take us, too. It is about one
hour’s ride to reach the place, and then one must walk
several blocks. We knocked at the door. After a minute
it was opened and Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl welcomed us. He
looked much older than when I used to serve him in
America. {{p109}} He still has the same desire to be left alone.
He loves to wait on his guests personally. After greeting
us, he inquired about many of the believers in America.
I was glad to convey to him their messages of love
and respect and to tell him how he is remembered and
honored by all the friends. He recalled his pleasant summers
spent in Green Acre, and wished that place a great
future. He asked about the health of Miss Farmer. He
inquired about the publication of his recent book, the
“Brilliant Proof” and requested that a copy be forwarded
to the Rev. Easton. He deplored his inability to travel
caused by his physical weakness.   

“If I were strong enough I would never stay in one
place more than a month. I would travel constantly
have advised the Bahá’í teachers, that this is the best way
to spread this universal message. They must fly from
one bush to another, and sing the songs of the Kingdom — the Kingdom of Abhá.”   

Then he served us with tea prepared by his own hands
and Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar related some of the incidents during
the trip of the Beloved in America.   

###  2. Alexandria is a Progressive City 

We were on our way home when we met Áqá Muḥammad
Báqir. The Master has appointed him to attend
to the occasional needs of Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl. He lives
near him. He told us that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent him to accompany
Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl to Ramleh.   

Alexandria to all intents and purposes is like a progressive
American city. Its tall buildings, its large department
stores, its clean avenues, its double-decked electric
cars, its delightful parks, its electrically lighted boulevards
and streets, its fine promenades around the seaport, are
all signs of a wonderful prosperous spirit. {{p110}} As I passed
along the streets it seemed as though I was walking on an
avenue in New York, and I wondered at the magical
transformations which had taken place since this city was
burned to the ground during the Arabi revolution thirty-one
years ago. The inhabitants of all nations, Greeks,
Italians, French, Jews, English, Arabs, Persians, live
here and associate with one another in perfect harmony.   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Talks with the Persian followers 

When we reached home it was nine o’clock and the
Master was sitting on the veranda with a number of believers.
I learned to my regret that I had missed a large
gathering of friends.   

“What did he speak of?” I asked. The answer was
given; about America, his addresses in churches and
temples, the unity of mankind and the beauty and holiness
of the spiritual life.   

###  4. Abu’l-Faḍl a Great Bahá’í Teacher 

Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl was there and the Master asked him
to inspect the house which he is going to rent for him.
When he returned he said that he was very satisfied with
the place and in a few days we will have him with us.
I shall ever be indebted to Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl who bestowed
so much kindness upon me during my first years in America.
He is today the greatest teacher in the Bahá’í world,
and through his writings he is beloved by friends and
respected by foes. May he live many years longer! How
the Master loves him, considers his comfort and tries to
prepare all means of happiness for him.   

In talking with Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said
when he will come to Ramleh he would be his physician,
and take good care of him. {{p111}} Abu’l-Faḍl is coming and
like a wise mentor he will guide and instruct us as long
as we are in Ramleh.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, JULY 26, 1913. 

Before chronicling the daily events I would like to
share with you the wonderful contents of a very great
Tablet revealed for the believers of God in Azarbayejan.   

###  1. The Fragrances of God and Their Marvelous Results 

O YE SPIRITUAL FRIENDS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ!   

“The faithful envoy has arrived and in the spiritual
world has conveyed the message to the believers of God
This blessed happy messenger is no other than the Fragrance
of attraction and the soul-refreshing breeze of the
Love of God. These stir hearts into cheerfulness and
make the spirits the treasures of joy and gladness. The
effulgence of Divine Unity has cast such splendor
over the hearts and spirits and created such tremendous
effect as to establish a bond of spiritual communication
between each and all, making them throb as one heart
and beat as one pulse. {{p112}} Therefore one observes that
spiritual reflections and merciful impressions are printed in
the utmost beauty and art, upon the Tablets of the hearts
and that their delicate forms are transparent and graceful
I pray God that, day by day, this spiritual communication
may become reinforced and cause more and more
the appearance of this Divine Unity in the world of humanity;
so that all mankind like unto disciplined soldiers,
may abide under the shade of the Word of God and
under the Flag of the Covenant, striving with all their
hearts and souls, that universal conciliation, cordial love
and spiritual communication may be firmly established
among the hearts of the inhabitants of the world; and
that all the children of men through the radiant, new Bestowal,
may consort and associate with each other in one
loving meeting; that strife and war may vanish from the
face of the earth; that the love of the Beauty of the
Most Glorious may encompass every atom of Creation;
that enmity be changed into amity; differences transformed
into good-fellowship; the foundation of animosity
destroyed; the basis of hatred demolished; the illumination
of Union cause the disappearance of the darkness of
limitation and the transcendent light of the Merciful
suffer the hearts of humanity to become the mines of the
refulgent Love of God.””   

###  2. Now Is the Time of the Union of All Nations and
Religions 

“O ye friends of God!   

“Now is the time when you must affiliate with all nations
with joy and the utmost kindness — thus may you
become the manifestors of the Mercy of His Highness
the One. Become ye the spirit of the world and the
quintessence of life in the temple of mankind. In this
wonderful century in which the Ancient Beauty — the
Most Great Name — has dawned from the horizon of the
world with infinite Bestowals. {{p113}} the Word of God hath
created such dominion and potency over the realities of
mankind that the effect and influence of human conditions
and environments are neutralized. With a penetrative
power He hath gathered all into the Court of Union
and addresses them as follows: —   

“‘Now is the time when the believers of God must unfurl
the Banner of Unity, singing the songs of friendship
in the Assemblages of the world and inviting all
to the universality and all-inclusiveness of the Grace of
God — so that the canopy of Holiness may be pitched on
the apex of creation and the nations brought under the
shade of the Word of Unity. This bounty shall become
unveiled in the Center of the world when the believers
of God will live in accord with the Teaching of the Merciful
One and occupy their time in the diffusion of the
sweet Fragrances of Universal Love.’   

###  3. In the Bahá’í Revelation There is No Limitation 

“In every dispensation the Command of friendship and
the law of Love have been revealed, but it has been circumscribed
within the circle of believing friends and not
with those outside of it. Praise be to God that in this
wonderful cycle the laws of God are not confined by any
limitations; neither must they be exercised toward a
special community to the exclusion of another. He hath
commanded the friends to show love, friendship, amity
and kindness to all the people of the world.   

###  4. Become Ye As Kind Fathers to the Children of
Humanity 

“Now the believers of God must live in accord with
these divine Teachings. They must become kind fathers
to the children of humanity; affectionate brothers to the
youths of mankind and soul-sacrificing children toward
those who are laden with age. {{p114}} The aim is this: You
must be in the utmost state of joy and fragrance and
show love and kindness to all, even to your enemies. Meet
persecution and adversity with trust. Whenever animosity
appears, deal with it with forbearance: make your
breasts targets for the arrows and spears of opposition.
Brave the ridicule, the blame and the rebuke with perfect
love: so that all nations may observe the Power of the
Most Great Name, and all people acknowledge the Potency
of the Blessed Perfection — showing how He hath
destroyed the foundations of strangeness, hath guided
the inhabitants of the world to unity and love, hath illuminated
the realm of man and transformed this terrestrial
globe into a delectable Paradise. These people are
like unto children, negligent and mindless. One must
train them with the utmost love and carry them with infinite
tenderness in the arms of Grace so that they may
taste the love of the Merciful One, become illumined like
unto candles and dissipate the darkness of this world.
Thus they may behold clearly and manifestly the glorious
crown and brilliant diadem with which the Most Great
Name — The Blessed Perfection — may my life be a sacrifice
to Him — hath adorned the heads of His Believers;
what graces He hath poured upon the hearts of His
friends; what love He hath brought into the world of humanity
and what friendship He hath caused to appear
among the children of men?   

“O Lord! O Lord! Confirm Thy righteous servants
in the practice of love and friendship to all mankind and
assist them in the diffusion of the Light of Guidance
which is descending from Thy Supreme Concourse upon
all the inhabitants of the world. {{p115}} Verily Thou art Powerful,
Mighty, Omnipotent, Generous! And, verily,
Thou art the Merciful, the Clement, the Compassionate
and the Bestower!   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

###  5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Ready for the Last Call 

This morning the Beloved called me to his presence
He spoke of the weather and of the state of his health
saying that he had not been feeling well, in Ramleh, but
that for the present he would not move to any other place,
no matter what might happen. He said, he has finished
his work. He has nothing else to do. He is now ready
for the last call! How he longs to quaff from that cup!
How sweet will be its taste! How delightful will be
that hour!   

He was surrounded by letters and papers. He handed
me a package just received from America to be translated
and made ready for his answers. He told me to
come back in the afternoon. Before leaving he wished
me to go into the reception room and visit Mrs. Getsinger,
which I did with great pleasure. We had an interesting
conversation about the Movement in the United
States and I read to her the above Tablet and together
we hoped that the believers of the Merciful would be inspired
to carry out its contents.   

###  6. Letters and News from America 

At four o’clock I returned. As I passed along the
street in front of the house, I looked up and lo — I saw
the Master sitting on the balcony dressed in his beautiful
white robe. He saw me and bade me come up.
When I entered the room he welcomed me with genuine
hilarity. He felt better this afternoon, and asked me to
read him the letters. He told me to sit down near the
open window, so that I might get the cool breeze, while
he walked back and forth. Did you ever think of the
great attention which he pays to all his servants? We began
to work. {{p116}} Because Mr. Joseph H. Hannen of Washington
D.C., was an active worker in the field and a
special friend of mine, I often read his reports first — so
this time I asked: —   

“May I read Mr. Hannen’s report?”   

The Master laughed heartily and said, that if Mr. Hannen
was my dear friend, he was at least his son.   

He was amused when I read how a clergyman was
brought into the Cause by hearing a lecture against it.   

###  7. Eloquent Speeches Must Be Delivered at Public
Gatherings 

As regards speaking at meetings he emphasized the
fact that he has written many times on this subject. He
sent a Tablet only a few days ago, which was meant for
all the believers. He wished me to send a copy of it to
Mr. Hannen and to write him that at the meetings and
gatherings eloquent addresses and inspiring speeches must
be delivered, explaining the principles of the Blessed Perfection,
and setting the hearts aglow with the Fire of the
Love of God.   

###  8. Persian American Educational Society 

He also was pleased to hear that $250.00 had been sent
to Dr. Moody in Ṭihrán, Persia, and expressed the hope
that the activities of the Persian American Educational
Society may increase yearly, and may be enabled to wipe
out its debt. He often speaks about this Society, its
large, disinterested platform and the fame which it has
acquired in such a short space of time.   

###  9. Many Tablets Dictated for Believers 

He revealed a Tablet for Mrs. Hannen about the Bahá’í
Sunday school and to many other believers in different
parts of the world. {{p117}} While he was dictating these Tablets
he was carrying on a long conversation with an Arab
<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>. When he had finished he came out, followed by
all of us. He took a long walk and about eight o’clock
returned to our apartment and stayed for nearly an hour
speaking at times and then lapsing into silence.   

###  10. Pray with an Attracted Heart 

Here I end with the following quotation from a recent
Tablet: —   

“Thou has written asking what thou shouldst do and
what prayer thou shouldst offer in order to become informed
of the Mysteries of God. Pray thou with an
attracted heart and supplicate with a spirit stirred by the
Glad-tidings of God. Then the doors of the Kingdom
of Mysteries shall be opened before thy face and thou
shalt comprehend the realities of all things.”

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, JULY 27, 1913. 

###  1. The Effect of Association with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

We are bathed in the sea of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s love; are
flying in the atmosphere of his beauty; drinking the wine
of his Grandeur; eating the food of his humility; listening
to the thrilling music of his divine voice; resting
under the ever-spreading tree of his teachings, and watching
the light and shade of his countenance. He inspires
our hearts with wondrous thoughts of social service and
mutual helpfulness. {{p118}} He reveals to our souls the secrets
of forgiveness and loving kindness. He teaches us patience
and long suffering. If hearts are not stony, these
lessons will, in the long run, bear fruit; and I believe
they will affect even the most adamant. For behind every
heart of stone, there is a warm one of flesh and blood
and under many a tattered coat, may live a noble prince.
His presence teaches us how insignificant are our endeavors,
how narrow our thoughts, how futile our works
in comparison with his grand accomplishments, his
sweeping, universal conception of mankind, his increasing
activities in all directions, and his attention to all details.
If we could walk in his footsteps, emulate him in
all our lives, serve our fellowmen as he serves them, spread
the Glad-tidings of the Kingdom as he spreads them, then
we shall have won his good pleasure.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Dictates Tablets for the Persians 

This morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar to
his Presence. He felt radiant and most happy. Mírzá
‘Alí-Akbar, finding him in some light-giving mood, relates
a few funny stories which make him laugh more.
Afterwards he sends for Mírzá Munír, and dictates to
him many Tablets for the Oriental believers, some of
which I translate herein because they contain paragraphs
concerning his trip to America. From now on there will
be a flood of Tablets flowing from his tongue. For more
than three years the Eastern believers have been deprived
of the traces of his pen. Now it is time to compensate
them.   

Toward noon he passed by the door of our house, followed
by an Arab. We thought that he was coming in
and so we prepared to receive him, but he passed on,
making the sign of salutation. {{p119}} He was evidently going
to fulfill an engagement.   

###  3. Tickets for Charity Bazaar 

Later he returned with a letter in his hand and distributed
among us several tickets for a charity entertainment,
which was to be held in the San Stefano Hotel. A
Pá<u>sh</u>á, who is a patron of the hotel had sent these tickets
to him. The fete was for a worthy cause — the erection
of a school, called Orwat-Ul-Woska.   

###  4. Importance of Cleanliness in All Things 

After the distribution of these tickets he spoke very
emphatically about cleanliness, especially in cooking. He
wished our Persian Bahá’í cook to wear a spotless white
apron, to wash his hands often with soap, to keep his
kitchen as clean as a pearl and to be as tidy and neat in
his cooking as the best French chef.   

Concluding his remarks he smilingly stated that if he
did not see these changes in the cook, he would use the
big stick, because some educators believe that one whipping
will do more good than a hundred words of advice.   

He recalled with much satisfaction a cook who had
kept a restaurant in Beirut many years ago, and who was
the embodiment of cleanliness. This cook did not touch
the meat with his hands, but cut it with a special instrument
and cooked it with great taste and delicacy. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
stayed in Beirut for a long time and he went often
to his kitchen to watch him at his work. {{p120}} As long as the
Master lived in that city he remained his customer.   

###  5. Description of a Charity Bazaar in Alexandria 

When he left we hurried along to the fete in the San
Stefano Casino. It was a palatial hotel, most splendidly
built. Hundreds of carriages and automobiles were waiting
in rows. As we entered we saw a large crowd of
people, nearly five thousand, dispersed all over the grounds.
Several bands of music were playing at different places.
Many other amusements attracted the attention of the
people. The wonderful sea with its ebb and flow was
shimmering under the sunshine. The crowd was orderly
and jovial. Except for the Tarboushes on the heads of
the young men, and the thin white veils which covered
the lower halves of the faces of women, letting their
black eyes and eyelids shine forth, I could not see much
difference between this and any American charity affair.
By seven o’clock it was almost impossible to move, so
dense was the throng. At night there were many moving
pictures, and an excellent display of fireworks which
evoked general applause. Later, the Master called at the
house of Ḥájí <u>Kh</u>urasání, and finding there a number of
Arabs, he gave them a talk which was taken down by one
of those present. After this meeting he returned to the
house, and entertained us with stories which evoked much
laughter. He was well and happy today.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, JULY 28, 1913. 

The following are a few quotations {{p121}} from Tablets revealed
yesterday for the Persian believers: —   

###  1. First One Must Teach Himself, Then Others 

“After my return from America and Europe, owing to
the difficulties of the long voyage and to the innumerable
inconveniences of the journey, a physical reaction
set in and I became indisposed. Now, through the Favor
and Bounty of the Blessed Perfection, I am feeling better;
therefore, I am engaged in writing this letter, so
that thou mayst realize that the friends of God are never
forgotten under any circumstances.... Now is the
time when the believers of God may imitate the conduct
and manner of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Day and night they must
engage in teaching the Cause of God but they must be in
the same spiritual state which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá manifested
while traveling in America. When the teacher delivers
an address, his words must first of all have a supreme
and powerful effect over himself so that everyone may
be In turn affected. His utterances must be like unto
flames of fire, burning away the veils of dogmas, passion
and desire. Moreover he must be in the utmost state of
humility and evanescence — so that others may become
mindful. He must have attained to the station of renunciation
and annihilation. Then and not until then, will he
teach the people with the Melody of the Supreme Concourse.”   

###  2. Heralding the Kingdom of God in the Cities of
Europe and America 

“Praise be to God that, through the Bestowal and
Grace of the Beauty of Abhá, (from the Continent of
Europe) (I have returned to the Continent of Africa.)
I have tarried in Egypt for a few days because I was
weakened by the fatigue of traveling through the Cities
of Europe; by the variable climates of the American
mountains and prairies and by the length and hardships of
the voyage. {{p122}} While in Europe one day we were in London
and another in Edinburgh; now in Paris and anon in
Stuttgart; once in Budapest and again in Vienna. We
were almost every hour in another place, delivering
lengthy speeches and addresses, and notwithstanding the
indisposition of the body, day and night I cried and raised
my voice in large meetings and important churches....
As there were many obstacles, the door of correspondence
was closed; but the faces of the illumined friends
were manifest at every hour in the Court of Consciousness,
and at all times they were present in my memory.
As I have now found a little leisure. I address you this
letter so that I may occupy myself with the servitude
of the believers of God, and become the means of the
happiness of the hearts. This is the utmost desire of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”   

###  3. While Encircled by the Whirlwind of Calumnies,
Blossom Ye Like a Rose 

“During this long trip great capacity was created in
every clime for listening to the Word of God; even in
the vast countries of the Orient the fame of the Cause
of God is spreading more and more. Therefore, the
friends of God must take as example my behavior and
demeanor. They must not rest one moment. They must
not seek quietude for one second. At all times they must
emanate joy and gladness. They must be occupied in
teaching the Cause of God. No event must sadden their
hearts. No catastrophe must break their spirit. {{p123}} With divine
happiness they must withstand every impending disaster.
During the time of peace, security, comfort and
the absence of grief, even the monkey will be a jovial
fellow. He will be happy, joyful, grateful, patient and
overflowing with gladsomeness. But the sincere servant
of Bahá’u’lláh, who is firm in the Covenant and steadfast
in the Testament, while surrounded by the most great sea
of tests; threatened by surging, rocking waves of persecution,
encircled by whirlwinds of calumnies and backbitings — will blossom like unto a rose and break into joyous
songs and sweet melodies like unto the nightingale.”   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Sacrificing His Life in the Path of Bahá 

“Your letter was received; but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, owing
to the infirmity of the body; the difficulty of voyaging
over seas and lands, the lack of rest, the striving and
exerting day and night; the delivering of long addresses
in different cities; and of answering the varied, and intricate
questions of the people; — has not been able to answer
it. His life, his identity, his heart and his body are
gladly sacrificed in the Path of Bahá! This is the Bestowal
of the Almighty! This is the Inestimable Favor
of God! This is the Favor of the Blessed Perfection!
These are the Graces of His Highness the One!”   

###  5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Tells of His Early Life 

It was about six o’clock in the morning when the door
of the house was opened and the Beloved came in. I had
Just finished dressing and was about to take my place at
my table to translate a few Tablets. The rest were
asleep, but they jumped out of bed and were dressed in a
few minutes. He was surprised that they were yet asleep
and told us he had already read many letters, written
several Tablets and attended to various other things before
leaving the house. {{p124}} Up to the time he was 32 years
old he never slept in bed, preferring always a piece of
mat and using for a pillow one or two books. He went
to sleep without changing his clothes, fearing that it
would take him some time to dress in the morning. But
now he cannot do these things. When he lived in ‘Akká
he generally kept ten secretaries busy; often dictating important
letters to three of them at the same time.   

###  6. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Tells the Arabs about His Western Trip 

Then he started to correct one of his addresses delivered
in San Francisco, and made some remarks about
the speeches before the open Forum and the Japanese Independent
Church. Just as he came suddenly, he left suddenly,
and there were many pledges that henceforward
everybody will be up before six A.M.   

He again came in the afternoon, stayed a long time,
and told us stories about three men who were great
cowards, but who became courageous and intrepid after
accepting the Bahá’í revelation. How graphic, how simple,
how matchless he is in his description of such events
Then he called on an important native Pá<u>sh</u>á and after
nine o’clock, returned to our house bringing an Arab
with him. After offering him coffee, he described the
meetings in the Bowery Mission in New York, and spoke
of the Salvation Army in London and of other incidents
of the wonderful Western trip. When he left the room,
we felt the sweet fragrance of the presence of God.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, JULY 29, 1913. 

###  1. Glad-Tidings of the Kingdom of Abhá from
Minneapolis 

This morning the Beloved sent for me and within a few
minutes I was standing in his holy presence. He dictated
several cablegrams, and spoke a few minutes on various
topics. Then I went to Alexandria to despatch the cables
and attend to other errands. As he handed me one of
the corrected addresses of California, he said these talks
must be translated into Arabic. Let it be done at once   

A package of newspapers was received from Minneapolis
in which the Glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abhá
were printed. These Glad-tidings had been sent to the
Master for correction while we were in Paris. I would
like to quote them because the Master was pleased with
my Persian translations of them.   

“Glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abhá!   

“We announce to you Glad-tidings of great Joy!
Similar words were spoken almost two thousand years
ago. Reflect and be not of the heedless. This is the
Great Day of God. This is the Day of Universal Peace
of Universal Brotherhood, of a Universal language and
of the Union of All Religions. This is the Day wherein
the Prophecies of the Holy Books of every tongue have
been, or are being, fulfilled. This is the Cycle of Bahá’u’lláh!   

“We announce to you His Holiness, the Báb, the Precursor
of ‘He whom God shall manifest.’   

“We announce to you Bahá’u’lláh, ‘He whom God
shall manifest.’ The one who has broken the Seals of
both the Creational and Collective books.   

“We announce to you ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Center of the
Covenant, the Interpreter of the Holy Books of all peoples
and of the Bahá’í Teachings, and the door through
which mankind can enter the Kingdom of God in this
Day and Dispensation.”   

For dinner the Beloved ate a special dish prepared by
one of the Pá<u>sh</u>ás and left at his house. {{p126}} In turn he sent
part of it to us. It was one of those rare delicacies of
Arabia, a kind of meat cake with vegetables and pinenuts.   

###  2. Modern Hospital in Alexandria 

I forgot to write that yesterday we called on Siyyid
Jalál, the son of a celebrated Bahá’í poet and teacher, living
in Ṭihrán. He is in the German hospital. A few
days ago he was operated on but now he feels much better.
The hospital is a model of elegance and cleanliness. All
the floors and walls are built of marble. Really I am
amazed at every turn, at the practical signs of progress
in Egypt. It is nothing short of miraculous! Walking
through the avenues and the European business districts
of Alexandria one thinks that one is living in Europe or
America.   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Takes the French Bahá’í Doctor
for a Drive 

In the afternoon I called on the Beloved and in his
presence found DeBons, a French Bahá’í dentist practicing
in Cairo — now on his way to Switzerland to meet his
wife. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is going to take him for a drive
through Nozha Park, which is the National Park of
Alexandria. I have heard much praise of it, but have not
yet been there. They say it rivals any park in Europe or
America. For nearly two hours ‘Abdu’l-Bahá entertained
the doctor driving through the park and speaking to him
about his spiritual experiences in America. {{p127}} When he returned,
he was as fresh as when I saw him in the morning.
For the last three or four days his health has been
improving and for this great blessing we proffer thanksgiving
and praise to the Lord. He walks among us as a
divine witness to all men. Every day spent in the neighborhood
of his light is equal to an age, the significance
and beauty of which cannot be grasped by the mentality
of man.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, JULY 30, 1913. 

###  1. The Cause of Bahá’u’lláh Is the Mainspring of Love
and Peace 

The Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is the Cause of life. Life
is the mainspring of material and spiritual activities. One
of the active principles is Love, the other is Peace. The
life of a Bahá’í is not rounded and developed without the
full manifestation of these two active principles. They
must become the dominant influence of his whole existence.
He must “love” the world and be at “peace” with
humanity; so that these two harmonious notes may blend
together and assist him to ascend to the highest summit
of true greatness and innate spiritual perception. The
prophets of God have come to inculcate in the life of
every individual these two principles; especially Bahá’u’lláh.
“He hath held aloft the banner of love and
peace. Whosoever is imbued with the realities of these
two principles, has life. {{p128}} Love and Peace are the causes
which hold together all the different elements of the mineral,
vegetable and animal kingdoms. Were it not for the
presence of these two divine forces constantly exercising
their benign influence, the whole scheme of creation
would have been smashed to pieces long ago. The power
of gravitation or attraction is no other than one of the
signs of these heavenly energies. Whenever the secret
power of these two spiritual verities is fully revealed in
the world of humanity, impelling mankind to grow
greater and greater in its capacity, then the glorious
zenith of divine civilization will become visible. It is our
duty to cause these two principles more and more to be
revealed, among ourselves, toward one another, and
among the people of the world. What a lofty privilege!
What a divine Bestowal! What a wonderful responsibility!
What a radiant glory! What ecstatic joy! What
pure happiness!”   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Tells about His Health and Work 

This morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent for me. Joyfully I
hastened to his holy house to receive the rays of his love
and benediction. He dictated cablegrams to various parts
of the world and spoke about the amount of work to be
accomplished. He stated that no one can imagine how
many different issues must be met, and how many conflicting
interests harmonized! He was now advanced in
age. The physical reaction of his long journey has had
a terrible effect upon his weakened constitution, and he
cannot work as vigorously as he used to in his youth.
When he reads a letter his eyes grow weary; when he
dictates a few Tablets, his mind gets tired, when he walks
a few thousand feet he becomes exhausted.   

How heart-breaking and joy-imparting is his condition
in these days. {{p129}} The barometer of his health never
stands on one mark for two days. Like the ebb and flow
of the sea, is the condition of his health. We watch him
with great solicitude, but are unable to do anything to alleviate
his pain or to increase his health. One day he told
us that the doctor enjoins upon him the dictum, Do not
work, Do not speak, Do not write, but God commands
him to work, speak and write. Now whose commands
should he obey?   

###  3. Oriental Bahá’ís Anxious to Receive the News 

A few minutes later I was out in the open, sad at heart
because I had seen ‘Abdu’l-Bahá so heavy-laden with the
burden of the world and there is not a single soul to
lighten it. While Siyyid Asadu’lláh was here he carried
on a large and profitable correspondence with all parts
of the Orient, thus informing the friends of the passing
events. They did not receive any Tablets, but his correspondence
kept them in touch with the Center and was
of course, a great consolation. But now he is gone to be
a soldier in the field and up to this date no one has been
appointed to fill his place; thus the believers in the Orient
are concerned and anxious. Mírzá Maḥmúd, upon his
arrival on Port Sa‘íd, discontinued writing weekly letters
and is now, day and night, busy compiling his notes. I
also am occupied with my own duties. Mírzá Munír
takes the dictation of Tablets for the Oriental Bahá’ís
which are being revealed almost every day.   

###  4. Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl and His Position in the Bahá’í Cause 

When I returned, the Master was in the house, Mírzá
Abu’l-Faḍl also being present. He recited in detail a resume
of his addresses in the Jewish synagogues of
America. {{p130}} The respect and utter humility of Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl in the presence of the Beloved is most touching. He
hardly raises his voice when he addresses him. Those
who have seen and heard Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl, know the extent
of his knowledge, the wide range of his learning, and
the brilliancy of his services to the Cause of God. Men
like him are rarest jewels and therefore they are loved
and honored by the Master. He has suffered imprisonment
for two years for the sake of his faith and has undergone
much persecution.   

###  5. Muḥammadan Mullás and Their Hair-splitting
Metaphysical Discussions 

In the afternoon the Master came in again and immediately
two Muḥammadan Mullás called on him.
These Arabs love hair-splitting religious controversies;
and therefore one of them tried to start the ball rolling.
The Master, with a wonderfully divine attitude, silenced
him and gently rebuked him for the utter uselessness of
theological discussions which are not productive of any
result. They were advised to investigate the Truth, free
from any prejudice. Then he spoke about his lecture in
Oxford University, his meeting with Mr. Alexander
G. Bell, the inventor of the telephone, in Washington, and
ended by telling them that his field of activity was in
Europe and America. He had come here to rest for a
few months.   

The Mullás were utterly defeated, begged humbly
for his forgiveness of their apparent negligence, and expressed
their conviction that they were highly profited
by the meeting and hoped that they would never forget
the lesson they had learned today.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, JULY 31, 1913, 

###  1. The Progress of the Bahá’í Cause in the Orient 

The progress of the Bahá’í Cause is evident. The
signs of awakening are apparent. The beauty of the
spiritual life is manifest. The traces of the Sun of
Reality are spreading. The mysteries of the Words of
God are revealed. The clouds of superstitions are dispelled.
The horizon of divine religion is clear. The
rose-garden of hearts is adorned. The nightingales of
significances are warbling. The flowers of faith are perfuming
the nostrils. The Breezes of the Holy Spirit are
vivifying the dead. The fountains of eternal life are
flowing. The vineyard of the Lord is verdant. The servants
are faithful, The gardeners are honest and sincere.   

From all all parts of the Orient the news of the forward
march of the Bahá’í Cause is being received. Men
and women are advancing toward the Kingdom of El
Abhá! On their lips are new hymns of praises! In their
hearts tumultuous voices of glorification. In their ears are
the sweet, ravishing melodies of the birds of paradise.
The teachers of the Cause are inspired with a new zeal.
Their hearts are fired with the unprecedented example
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Difficulties! There are none. {{p132}} From
every corner of the Orient the still small voice grows into
volume and force, becoming irresistible in its might, removing
every obstacle from its path, and attacking the
rank and file of the forces of darkness, putting them into
complete rout.   

Through the gloomy night of ignorance and fanaticism,
the light-bearers of Reality, with torches in their
hands are running through the length and breadth of the
East, illumining hearts with the effulgence of the Kingdom.
Lo! do you hear the songs of the Eastern teachers
which are being co-ordinated into one mighty voice: —   

Let us follow the example of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! He has
paved for us the highroad of teaching! Let us follow
him! Let us emulate him! We shall seek no rest, wish
for no comfort! We are his soldiers and he is our commander!
We must increase the power of our activity!
We must travel! We must forget everything else save the
promotion of the Cause!   

Thus a new spirit is aroused all over the East, impelling
the teachers to go forward, to rush onward, to follow
‘Abdu’l-Bahá!   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Tells about Ra<u>sh</u>íd Pá<u>sh</u>á and His
System of Extortion 

The Beloved called this morning. He was in a happy
mood. Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl was there; so the main part of
the talk was directed to him. First ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke
of the two Mullás who visited him yesterday, saying
that these Arab <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s do not understand what fair discussion
means. They love a good fighty argument better
than their lives. They do not mean to investigate a given
subject, examine its minor and major points and obtain
the conclusion. They love to go on, pro and con, ad
infinitum.   

Then he spoke about Ra<u>sh</u>íd Pá<u>sh</u>á, a former Governor
of Syria who had called upon him many times in
Paris. He said, in part, that this man, according to popular
tradition, must have been bad even before Adam
and Eve. {{p133}} He extorted money with the flimsiest excuses
from the peaceful citizens of Syria. For example, he
would send for a wealthy merchant or manufacturer to
come to Beirut on urgent business. Then on his arrival
be would tell him, “I have received bad reports concerning
your character and dealings. You must stay here till
I send a committee to investigate these reports and then
I will set you free.” The man, finding himself helpless
in the face of such accusations, stayed one, two, three,
four weeks. Meanwhile, there was no one at the head of
his business, and alarming reports come to him. Finally
he felt constrained to give a few hundred pounds to the
governor so that he might get away. Ra<u>sh</u>íd Pá<u>sh</u>á was
also a favorite spy of the Sulṭán of Turkey. He would
forward the most dreadful reports about the law-abiding
citizens, thus filling his pockets with bribery and extortion.   

###  3. The Episode of Ra<u>sh</u>íd Pá<u>sh</u>á and Madame Jackson
about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Freedom 

It so happened that at one time the secretary of the
Turkish Embassy in Paris met Madame Jackson at a reception.
Madame Jackson told him about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
incarceration in the town of ‘Akká, and of the cruelty and
injustice of the Turkish authorities. This secretary, being
a relative of Ra<u>sh</u>íd Pá<u>sh</u>á, answered Madame Jackson,
saying, that there must needs be at least 3000 pounds
sterling to bring about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s freedom. Madame
Jackson agreed to pay this sum if he succeeded in achieving
his liberty. Immediately he reported to Ra<u>sh</u>íd
Pá<u>sh</u>á that there lived a woman in Paris who was willing
to pay a large sum if ‘Abdu’l-Bahá could be set free.
The governor, who loved money better than his life,
cabled back to Paris, “Very well, it will be done.”   

Meanwhile ‘Abdu’l-Bahá heard about the episode in this
way: {{p134}} One day, the Mutaṣarrif of ‘Akká, who was the
husband of the sister of Aḥmad ‘Izzat Pá<u>sh</u>á, came running
to him, saying, “God be praised! All the means are
prepared!” “How?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked. “What has
happened?” “Oh! do you not know?” he said. “Soon
you will be free. You will go out of this prison. You
will travel wherever you wish.” Then he told the rest
of the story. As soon as he left ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s abode, the
latter sent a cable to Madame Jackson. “Beware! Beware!
lest you pay one cent for my freedom. In prison
I am feeling happy!” When the governor heard about
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instructions to Madame Jackson, he was,
of course, furious. He had thought it would be so easy
to get this sum of money. So he changed his tactics, and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá one day received a letter from his secretary
saying that the governor was very anxious to see him
enjoying the air of freedom. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not answer.
After a week, he received another letter from the
same secretary announcing that the governor had instructed
him to draw up a petition to his Imperial Majesty,
begging for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s liberty. Again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
did not answer. Then he wrote that the petition
was ready to be mailed. No answer. Again: the governor
is going to sign the papers and mail them tomorrow.
No answer. Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá received his last
letter, saying that the governor had read the petition and
had written over the envelope, ‘Not to be sent.’ No answer.
When the governor realized that he had failed in
everything, he sent his own son to ‘Akká to see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
personally, thinking that perchance he might succeed.
The son was, of course, lavishly entertained by
Mutaṣarrif. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was invited to meet him. After
dinner the son brought up the subject from various points
of view. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá took the attitude that he knew
nothing about the matter. {{p135}} After dinner he followed
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to his house and spoke a great deal, but to
no effect. “I am sorry to see you in prison,” he would
say. “Here I am happy,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá answered. When
in the morning he was leaving, disappointed, he made another
effort by saying, “I hope, my Effendi, that I shall
see you next time in Haifa.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá waved the
matter aside. When the governor heard the unsuccessful
report of his son, he was crestfallen and angry. At that
time he was so powerful that all the inhabitants of Syria
trembled through fear of him. His reports to the Sulṭán
were laws. One word from him would bring down the
ire of his Majesty on anybody’s head, no matter how
important and influential they were.   

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá realized that they were again at
their old tactics, trying to make him say the word “yes”
to their extortionate demands, he one day called Mutaṣarrif
to his house and told him defiantly: “Do not
make any more intrigues; you shall fail in all your secret
machinations. There is a destined period for my imprisonment.
Before the coming of that time, even the kings
of the earth cannot take me out of this prison, but when
the appointed moment arrives, all the emperors of the
world cannot hold me a prisoner in ‘Akká. I shall then go
out. Rest thou assured of this.”   

When the Mutaṣarrif heard this emphatic statement,
he wrote a letter to the governor, advising him not to
make any further move “because ‘Abbás Effendi knows
the Talisman of Imám ‘Alí. He has learned from the position
of the heavenly Constellations the time of his freedom
and no one can hasten it. {{p136}} It is better for us to give
up this idea.”   

###  4. The Infinite Patience of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Answering
the Tribunal Questions Put to Him 

At noon Mírzá Munír brought me a letter to translate
into Persian. When this was finished I called at the
Master’s house to deliver it. I knocked at the door three
or four times before <u>Kh</u>usraw answered. As I waited outside
I heard the voice of the Master, dictating Tablets to
Mírzá Munír. I was then announced and ushered into
the room. The Master welcomed me. He was sitting
near the balcony; in front of him was a chair piled high
with letters from the East and West. His dress and turban
were of snowy white matching his beautiful locks
and beard. Across the street there was a tall green acacia
tree which attracted his attention. Now and then his
eyes closed and again opened revealing infinite pity and
love hidden in his eyes. Mírzá Munír was sitting writing
down the heavenly words which flowed like a fountain
from the tongue of the Beloved. As I watched him, I
was struck by the divine beauty of his countenance, soft,
tender and most adorable.   

The many difficult problems of the Bahá’í world are
solved by him. Now he writes to Persia on how to hold
an election, then to far-off America on how to rent a hall.
One Bahá’í desires to know whether she should cook food
for her child; another person asks how to proceed to buy
a piece of land. There are some misunderstandings in
this assembly to be removed; the feelings of some person
are ruffled, and must be smoothed down. One man’s
mother or father is dead, he requests a Tablet of visitation,
another desires to have a wife. To one a child is
born, she begs for a Bahá’í name; another has taught several
souls, he asks for Bahá’í rings for them. This man
has had business reverses, he must be encouraged, another
has fallen from a ladder, he implores for a speedy
recovery. {{p137}} One has quarreled with his wife, and he wants
advice on how to be reconciled; another supplicates for
blessings upon his marriage. The Master goes over these
one by one with infinite patience and with his words of
advice, creates order out of chaos. The sorrows of the
world troop along in review before him, and as they pass,
lo, the transformation happens! The sorrowful becomes
joyful, the ill-tempered good-natured, the lazy active, the
sleepy one awakened. With magical words he transmutes
iron into gold and darkness into light. At last he rises
from his seat and for a while walks to and fro, still dictating
Tablets to the philosopher and to the simple; soaring
toward the empyrean of spirituality, giving us a vision
of sanctity, and of the roses of Paradise, and for a while
we roam, guided by him, in those delectable gardens of
Abhá, intoxicated with the fragrance of God; and then we
find ourselves in the streets, walking home upborn on the
wings of light.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 1, 1913. 

###  1. What Can We Do to Spread the Bahá’í Cause? 

What can we do to become more fitting instruments,
and purer channels, devoted whole-heartedly to the furtherance
of the Bahá’í Cause? Is it through the organization
of various committees? {{p138}} The discussion of various
plans? The reading of Tablets and Words? The delivery
of public addresses? The expounding of the Holy
Utterances? The holding of Friday or Sunday meetings?
The announcement of the Message? The publication
and circulation of literature? It may be through
any, or all of these, in fact each one of the above methods
is important in its own place. But from a larger outlook,
it is through the attraction of the heart, the purity
of conscience, the spirituality of ideals, the concentration
of selfishness, the leaping forth of the fire of the Love of
God and the entire renunciation of self.   

For the last few days many Tablets have been revealed
for the Persian believers, and therefore it is very fitting
to translate a few extracts: —   

###  2. The Difficulties of the Western Journey Have Left
Their Impressions on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

“The long journey over sea and land, the innumerable
difficulties in the morn and at eve, the lack of rest and
sleep, the delivery of detailed addresses in public congregations,
the meetings with visitors from sunrise to midnight
in America, the answering of countless questions
and the withstanding of the hardships of the trip, have
made their impression on this earthly constitution, and the
result is a great weakness.... It is now a few days
since I arrived in Ramleh, and feeling somewhat better, I
am engaged in writing to you.   

“Convey infinite longing and love on behalf of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
to all the believers of God. Day and night I am remembering
the friends, kneeling before the Threshold
and begging for them the confirmations of the Kingdom
of Abhá. {{p139}} I hope that from now on the broken chain of
correspondence will be taken up and that through the protection
and preservation of the Blessed Beauty the pen
will be set in motion.”   

###  3. Now the Importance of the Station of the Believers
Is Unknown 

“The Glances of Divine Providence are always vouchsafed,
the infinite Bestowals are continually descending.
There are clear evidences that in the service of the Cause
of God you are confirmed. Know ye the value of this
most great Favor and render ye thanksgiving unto the
Threshold of God by day and by night; because you have
adorned your heads with such Glorious Crowns and have
illumined such a light-giving candle in the assemblage of
the world! Now the greatness of this station is hidden
and invisible, but ere long it will become evident and manifest.”   

###  4. Service of the Believers of God 

“Thank God that thou are assisted in serving the believers
of God. Thou art the enkindled brasier of the
Fire of Love and a lamp of the utmost purity through
which the Light of God’s attraction shines forth. Appreciate
the value of this Divine Favor. Be self sacrificing,
and give exhilaration and rejoicing to the friends
of God and engage in adoration and thanksgiving to the
Most Glorious Lord with infinite gladness and happiness.   

Today the Beloved came to see us in the morning. He
sat on the veranda and asked Mírzá Munír to bring the
Tablets which he dictated yesterday to be corrected by
him. For half an hour he read them over and made a
few corrections here and there. {{p140}} Then he dictated a Tab1et
to Maharajah of Couch Bahar of India. He also dispatched
eight cables to the various cities of Persia giving
the believers the good news of his health. Then went out
to call on Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Faḍl.   

###  5. A Bahá’í Meeting in Alexandria 

For the first time since my arrival in Ramleh I went
to a Bahá’í meeting in the house of <u>Kh</u>urasání. There
were many Persian and Arabian Bahá’ís present. After
our entrance, according to the Eastern custom, rose-water
was given us with which to anoint our faces. Then tea
was served and conversation started. I told them something
about our American trip in which they were greatly
interested. We spoke of certain people who rise to a
great station in the Cause, then suddenly fall and are forgotten.
One of the old believers illustrated this subject
as follows: —   

“If a person scales only a few steps of the ladder and
falls, he can arise, shake off the dust, heal his bruises and
scale the ladder again. But if he falls from the highest
step, it will be most difficult for him to arise.”   

Then an old man began to chant a prayer of Bahá’u’lláh
when some one brought in the news that the Master
was arriving. Immediately the man stopped his chanting,
all voices were hushed, and everybody was on
his feet, awaiting the coming of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As he entered
all heads bowed down and he walked toward the upper
part of the room and seated himself on the divan. He
spoke in Arabic, for the sake of the Arabian Bahá’ís
The subject was the Pyramids and their antiquity. When
he left the room he called me to go with him and I was
very happy. He spoke to me with much gentleness and
kindness. {{p141}} He is at all times thinking of the welfare and
comfort of his servants.   

###  6. Bahá’í Detachment and Independence 

While he walked along the street he was commenting
on the fact that he desired every Bahá’í to be severed and
detached. If he passes between two mountains of gold,
he must not look to either side. Those souls who have
entered under the shade of the Blessed Perfection must
display such independence as to astonish the people of the
world. If men come to them with money and supplicate
them to accept it, they should reject it.   

###  7. Arrival of Members of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Family 

On the way Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar brought the news that the
Greatest Holy Leaf, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sister, his daughter,
Shoghi Effendi, and five or six others had arrived from
Haifa. The Beloved came to see us, sat for one hour,
drank a cup of coffee, and then left us to return to his
house to see the newcomers.   

In the evening Shoghi Effendi brought me a few letters
from America sent by Aḥmad Yazdí, and the new
book by Mr. Horace Holley “The Modern Social Religion,”
which is just out.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 2, 1913. 

###  1. “The Greatest Holy Leaf” — the Daughter of
Bahá’u’lláh 

Today the Beloved did not come to see us in the morning
because he was entertaining “the Greatest Holy Leaf”
and the rest of the friends who had Come with her. {{p142}} In
the Bahá’í Cause she is a unique woman. She has devoted
all her life to the service of humanity. She is a
glorious star set upon the crown of womanhood, and a
light-giving personality. Everybody takes her advice because
she is a loving mother and sister to every Bahá’í.
Her noble life is a glorious epic of self-sacrifice, generosity,
and kindness. She radiates joy and ecstasy and is the
worthiest representative of her kind. All those who have
come within the radius of her calm, spiritual influence
and have spoken even a few words with her, bear testimony
to the fact that she is a heavenly soul — wonderfully
spiritual, highly cultivated and attuned with the ethereal
music of the celestial spheres. Well may all womankind
be proud of her sweet life, spent in the path of God, consecrated
to the Love of God and dedicated to the service
of the Almighty!   

Two pilgrims have just arrived from Persia. One is
from Yazd, the other from <u>Kh</u>urasán, a relative of Bábu’l-Báb,
Mullá Ḥusayn Bu<u>sh</u>rú’í — the first believer
in the Báb.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Talks with Two Pilgrims 

I was going to take a walk when I saw the Master,
dressed in his pure white garment, slowly coming toward
me. I stood aside in a reverent attitude until he arrived,
then I followed him. He felt very tired because he had
read and written a great deal during the day.   

He wished that he could get away, and be alone for several
weeks and do nothing but rest, but he wondered
whether he would be happy! He entered the house and
our dear pilgrims wanted to kneel before him and kiss
his hands, but he prevented them from doing so. {{p143}} He
inquired from each how the Cause was progressing in
their respective cities. The one from Yazd answered that
the Cause was spreading very rapidly in that part of the
world, the teachers were very zealous and active, the
meetings very radiant and that every day from ten to
fifteen people were instructed in various gatherings. The
Master praised their zeal and courage and expressed the
hope that they would increase their enthusiasm and their
power of teaching.   

###  3. This Is the Day of Teaching 

In talking with these pilgrims the Master emphasized
that this is the day of teaching. This is the day of service.
This is the day of the illumination of the world of
humanity. Nothing else will give permanent result. This
is their work.   

Then he left us, but our hearts were full with his love,
a love which never grows dim, but is light upon light.   

###  4. Mr. Atwood, an Englishman 

I went out, walking toward the Hotel Plaisance where
Miss Hiscock and Mr. Atwood live. I had a most interesting
talk with the latter. He is very cultured and
learned and the Master thinks highly of him. He writes
articles for Magazines, is well-informed on many subjects
and has lived in Ramleh with his wife and two children
for nearly four years. {{p144}} From now on I hope to see
him as often as I can for I have great admiration for him.
He is a man of intelligence and sound mind.   

I will end my letter today with the translations of a few
extracts from the Tablets.   

###  5. Filial Piety 

TO A FATHER WHOSE SON
IS A TEACHER IN THE CAUSE.   

“Every son who does not become a cause of glory for
his parents is a manifest loss. How many children turn
out to be fruitless and unfaithful! Therefore render
thanksgiving unto the Lord that thou hast such a kind
and skillful son. He is a servant of the Cause and very
efficient. He is favored at the Threshold of the Most
Glorious King. His heart and soul are vivified through
the Breaths of the Merciful. His eyes are turned toward
the horizon of His Highness, the Unconstrained. His
tongue is fluent with the divine proofs and evidences, and
his nostrils perfumed with the sweet Fragrances of the
Clement One.”   

###  6. The Future of Persia 

“The region of Núr is the birthplace of the Speaker on
the Mount. Consider to what grandeur, importance and
splendor it shall attain throughout future ages and cycles.
It shall become the abode of the Paradise of the Kingdom;
the forest for the lions of the Forgiving Lord, the
Holy Ground for the people of all nations and the abode
of the angels of the Most High, for the Fire of Sinai
flamed forth from this region and the Most Great Luminary
dawned from this horizon. But a thousand times
alas, that the inhabitants of that country are still heedless
and unaware. {{p145}} Ere long they shall become awakened and
mindful, and they will glorify and magnify the Lord for
these privileges.”   

###  7. What ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Saw and Ddd on His Western Tour 

O YE ILLUMINED FRIENDS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ:   

“It is well-nigh three years since, like unto the wind
I have been crossing vast deserts and like unto the nestless
and shelterless bird, I have day and night been singing
over mountains and shores. Now, in the middle of
the ocean, I watched the crest of the furious tempest and
while traveling I beheld the vastness and the immensity
of the wilderness. One moment of rest I enjoyed not;
one second of peace I sought not. Throughout many
cities of the Occident I delivered the Glad-tidings of the
appearance of the Sun of the Orient, in many churches
I raised the cry of Ya Bahá’u’l-Abhá, and before innumerable
audiences, with resonant voice gave the Gospel of the
Kingdom.   

“Praise be to God that the rays of the Sun of Reality
are shining upon the East and the West, changing dark
nights into luminous days. From every direction the cry
of ‘Ya Bahá’u’l-Abhá’ is being heard and from every side
the voice of ‘Oh my Lord the Supreme!’ has reached to
the zenith of heaven....   

“In short, after great difficulties, from the West I have
returned to the East. I shall tarry in Egypt for a while
so that I may gain physical strength and energy; perchance,
God willing, I may render a service to the Threshold
of God, and at the Court of the Beauty of Abhá,
may be confirmed in Thralldom. {{p146}} If the believers of God
loosen the tongue of teaching, in a short time, undoubtedly
this world will become another world, the rays of
the Most Great Luminary shall shine and its darkness be
transformed into the illumination of the East and the
West.”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 3, 1913 

###  1. Spiritual Sustenance Distribute in the Morning 

His Holiness the Báb has said that every day before
sunrise the spiritual sustenance of mankind is provided
and distributed. Similarly, how appropriate it is to adore
the beginning of every letter with the name of the Lord
of mankind and with quotations from the Tablets revealed
from the tongue of the Beloved! He thus writes to a Persian believer:   

###  2. Spiritual Receptivity 

“The Cloud of Providence hath poured down the rain
of guidance upon the East and the West; the rays of the
Sun of Reality has shone forth upon all the inhabitants of
the world, but out of the brackish ground nothing will
grow except thorns and thistles and the effulgences of the
Orb of Truth do not penetrate through the black stone.
Therefore, thank God that thy pure heart was the clear
mirror reflecting the radiant rays of divine guidance, and
that thy mind was fertile soil, because, through the downpour
of the rain of Grace there have appeared the flowers,
anemones of wisdom. Thank God for this Eminent
Bounty, for verily thou art of those who have attained.”   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Sang a New song in Every Garden 

“Thy letter was received. {{p147}} Thou hast lamented and
complained because it is some time since thou hast received
any letter from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. For forty years ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was kept in prison, but his infinite longing was to
spread with a resonant voice the word of God throughout
all countries and to unloosen his tongue in the exposition
of Truth and in teaching the Cause. No sooner
was he freed from prison, than he hastened to every clime
and country. On every mountain he raised a cry of ‘He
is God’ and in every city he spoke with public-spirited
men. In every garden he sang a new melody, and like
unto the bird of the morning raised the note of Ya Bahá
El Abhá. In every meeting he elucidated the teachings
of this divine Cause and while traveling through the
Western countries he summoned all to the Kingdom
of God. Under such circumstances, there was no
time to write, and therefore correspondence was neglected.”   

###  4. The Muḥammadan Month of Fasting 

This is the first of the month of Ramaḍán — the
month of Muḥammadan fasting. The Beloved made this
announcement this morning as he entered the house. He
sat down on the veranda and spoke on the subject of
fasting. The Muḥammadans are very strict about it.
One must eat, drink and smoke nothing from sunrise
until sunset. As the eastern calendar is lunar, the month
of fasting falls in different seasons; as a result of this
arrangement it is in August this year — a month extremely
hot with days exceptionally long. The laborers and farmers
suffer very much from thirst during the day, but
they do not break the laws of their religion. If by mere
chance a Muḥammadan is seen eating in the street, he is
punished by the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>. {{p148}} In the evening all good Muḥammadans
go to the Mosque to pray, and strictly obey
all the ceremonials connected with this holy month.
Every person — whether he understands it or not — should
read the Qur’án, at least once, from cover to cover. This
act is most meritorious.   

The Master told Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar to go to Alexandria
and bring our two new pilgrims back to live with us.
They had taken rooms in a native hotel somewhere down
town. By three o’clock they were here full of joy and
delight because they were going to be near the Beloved
and see him every day.   

###  5. What Is the Real Object of the Fast? 

In the afternoon the Master came and as there were
present several Arabian believers, he talked in Arabic
on physical and spiritual fasting. Real fasting is to abstain
from carnal desires and the promptings of ego.
Fasting means to purify the heart from every stain of
egotism, replacing material tendencies with spiritual susceptibilities,
refining the moral fibre, intensifying the Fire
of the Love of God, cleansing the self from the dross of
haughtiness, teaching humility and dispelling the darkness
of ignorance.   

After the Beloved left, the audience scattered, and went
out for a brief stroll. In a few minutes I found myself
in the Hotel Plaisance talking with Mr. Atwood, Miss
Hiscock and a very charming Turkish lady. {{p149}} She spoke
French and English quite well besides three or four other
languages.   

I will conclude today by quoting the translation of another
Tablet.   

###  6. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Writes to an Indian Prince 

“THROUGH REV. PROMOTHO LOLL SEN
“TO HIS HIGHNESS PRINCE MAHARAJ COUCH BAHÁ,
“(Upon him be greeting and praise)   

“He is God!   

“O HAPPY STARRED AND NOBLE PRINCE:   

“The gift you have forwarded was very acceptable because
it was from your Highness: this exiled one over
mountain and plain, this wanderer over land and sea took
that cup as a symbol, signifying: ‘I am thirsty for the
Water of Reality and longing for intoxication with the
Wine of Knowledge.’   

“Therefore I upraised the hand of supplication toward
the Kingdom of the Incomparable One, praying: — O
Thou Almighty, Deign to fill this Divine Cup with the
Wine of Thy Love and let this golden goblet overflow
with the nectar of Thy Grace; {{p150}} so that friends and strangers
may become exhilarated with the wine of ‘Am I not
your lord?’ and shareless ones become the adorers of the
Ideal Wine.   

“In short I offered the utmost prayer and supplication
at the Threshold of the Possessor of Glory that your
kind father the leader of the Worthies, the Glorious
Amir, may be submerged in the Ocean of divine Grace,
become intoxicated with the Wine of Celestial Bestowal
and Favor, obtain the Peace of the spirit in the Rose-garden
of the Merciful in the midst of the Paradise of
Knowledge, and attain to the station of Transfiguration
in the Delectable Heaven of God.   

“May the almighty confer the happiness of both
worlds upon thee, O happy starred Prince, grant eternal
joy and felicity never-ending, suffer thee to become the
manifestation of confirmation and to inspire thee under
all circumstances with a new spirit!   

“This is the prayer of this wanderer in behalf of that
leader of freedman.   

“Upon thee be greeting and praise!   

(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 4, 1913. 

###  1. The Blessings of the Universal Mind 

Praise be to God that the world has heard the message
of Reality, listened to the clarion call of Wisdom, quaffed
the Water of Eternal Life, hastened toward the arena of
Knowledge, embraced the Beloved of Truth, has been
quickened by the breaths of the Holy Spirit, stirred by
the Glad-Tidings of the Lord of Hosts and rejoiced by
the wonderful words of God! May the hearts become as
fountains from which the limpid water of divine spirit
ever flow! May the minds become as the rose-gardens
wherein the flowers of idealism grow and develop! May
the spirits become as mines out of which nuggets of love
and jewels of friendship are produced! This is the
world’s heavenly heritage. The inner world, like a beautiful
meadow, is carpeted with hyacinths of affection,
violets of harmony, anemones of immortal ideals, and
lilies of spiritual susceptibilities. {{p151}} No one should hide
these tender flowers under a glass. Let the light shine.
Sing like unto a nightingale. Gird up the loin of endeavor.
Soar heavenward. Step into the arena of activity.
diffuse the radiancy of the celestial light. Leap
forward. Raise the ringing watchword of Peace and
Brotherhood. Do not tarry. Travel on and on in the
mystic realms of Guidance. Your helper is God. Your
inspirer is the Holy Spirit. Your co-workers are the
angels of the Supreme Concourse. Ye have received the
Truth, and the Truth hath made you free. What greater
blessing is there than this? This is Eternal Glory and
everlasting Life.   

In order to teach the Cause of Peace, every person must
become a clear channel for the expression of God and the
manifestation of the attributes of God. We are all His
servants, and before His throne we stand with the utmost
humility. We must increase our effort, strive in the pathway
of righteousness, illumine the world of humanity
with the rays of brotherhood and interracial feeling and
upraise the standard of the solidarity of mankind. This
is the world’s work! This is the task set for man!
With the assistance of God and the cooperation of all
public-spirited leaders we will not fail.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Family Prayer in the Morning 

Hardly were we out of our beds when <u>Kh</u>usraw rang
the bell. Ḥájí Siyyid Javád and myself were summoned
by the Beloved. When we arrived at the door of his
apartment, <u>Kh</u>usraw made a sign to wait. The door was
shut and we could see nothing. In a moment I heard
a sweet voice of a woman. Oh! She was chanting a
prayer and I was all attention. I knew what it was.
Like a flash it dawned upon me. {{p152}} It was the family morning
prayer offered at the Threshold of Bahá’u’lláh and
presided over by the Center of His Covenant. As I
waited there I pictured in my mind a spiritual society,
when every home would be a temple of God like unto the
home of the Beloved. From these hearths every morning
chants of thanksgiving and praise would be sent up to
heaven from the lips of those whose hearts were stirred
by the spiritual Fragrance, whose spirits were treasuries
of the mysteries of God and whose consciences reflect the
longing and aspirations of the angels!   

The chant continued soaring higher and higher, carrying
me away to a glorious world! I thought I was
listening to the delectable voices of the Seraphim and
Cherubim. Then it ended in a hush of silence, leaving
behind the delicate hues and perfumes of the world of
God and filling the void with a rare atmosphere of spirituality!   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi 

Now the door opened and we were bidden to the Master’s
writing room. As we sat there we heard Shoghi
Effendi chanting with pathos and sweetness. As he ended
the prayer suddenly I heard the voice of the Master. I
was on my feet. What marvelous depth of feeling! It
causes the stones to dance with joy! He was teaching
Shoghi Effendi how to chant and how to control his
voice under various expressions.   

What a heavenly Feast I have had this morning!
Manna from on high! What a great privilege to have
even a mental glimpse of this Holy Shrine of the Lord
of Mankind where every morning, prayers are proffered
for the general welfare of all the human race; {{p153}} such
prayers as will effect the very foundations of the social
consciousness of every man and woman in this world.   

Then the Master entered our room and said that, inasmuch
as it was the month of Ramaḍán, he couldn’t
serve us tea. He had prepared many envelopes containing
Tablets to be mailed and he asked Ḥájí Siyyid Javád
to take them to Port Sa‘íd and there to be registered.   

###  4. The Persians Delighted with the Pictures in
American Magazines 

While I was in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence the mail man
brought several letters from America and four big packages
of the Magazines, “Travel,” kindly sent by Mr. Roy
C. Wilhelm. These magazines delighted many. Already
several copies are with Shoghi Effendi, some of them are
with Mr. Atwood. Everybody is interested in the pictures.
I would appreciate it if the friends could send
every month some of the current magazines and papers.
They would delight the hearts of many friends, especially
the illustrated ones.   

###  5. Universal Homage Paid to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

In the afternoon I called on the Master. He was sitting
on the balcony. He asked me about the news from
America. I read him the letters just received from Miss
Thompson, Mrs. Ralston, Miss H. Magee, Mrs. Fraser,
and others.   

After half an hour’s talk about the Cause in America
he left the house and I accompanied him. He is shown
marked respect by everyone as he walks in the streets.
The policeman standing at the corner salutes him, the
man sitting on the ground gets up as though compelled
to do so by a superior force. {{p154}} He walked toward
our house and surprised everyone by his sudden appearance.
For nearly an hour he sat on the veranda watching
the slow stream of life passing by. Now and then he
spoke in monosyllables and then he took his customary
walk.   

###  6. Life during the Month of Muḥammadan Fast 

During the days of Ramaḍán life is very interesting
just before and after sunset. Before sunset, because
everybody is exhausted with hunger and thirst; then restaurants
are filled by the people awaiting anxiously the
setting of the sun, and the streets present a hustling, motley
crowd; after sunset, because once they have satisfied
their appetites they go out to the cafes, amusement places
and theaters.   

###  7. How Eager Are the Bahá’ís of Persia for Martyrdom 

Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl came in the evening, and told us a
few incidents out of the rich treasury of his life. When
he was imprisoned in Ṭihrán with 18 others, there was
an old man among them by the name of Mírzá Muḥammad
Riḍá. He was well known for three rare qualities: firmness,
fearlessness and truthfulness. He defied the prison
authorities by his courage; awed the enemies by his firmness
and set at naught the intrigues of the foes through
his truthfulness.   

“Whenever,” Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl said, “Ḥájíbu’d-Dawlih,
one of the Ministers of the Court, came to the prison to
investigate the condition of some one, Mírzá Muḥammad
Riḍá would approach him and speak to him with great
earnestness. Finally Ḥájíbu’d-Dawlih would turn to him
with a despairing look saying, ‘Sir! This is impossible!
I cannot do it. Why did you not ask the Prince Ná’ibu’s-Sulṭánih
about this? He can do it. {{p155}} He has the authority.’
At last one day we asked him ‘What is this
which you talk about with Ḥájíbu’d-Dawlih, whenever he
comes to the prison, and why does he refuse you so emphatically?’
He said: ‘I ask and plead with him to sentence
me to death. I tell him: I am an old man, I am of
no good to the world. I want to bathe my body in blood
for the sake of Bahá’u’lláh. Please, please, I beg you to
do something for me. Is this too much of a favor that I
ask of you? Are you not kind enough to fulfill this last
wish of an old man? Praise be to God that you are an
influential person. But he does not listen to me and
answers me loudly in the manner you have all heard.’”   

###  8. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Confounds the Mullás in the Mosque 

Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl was giving us a graphic description
of another prison scene, and he had just reached its climax
when the door opened and the Master entered. Apparently
he felt well and in a happy mood. He told us
that last Friday he had gone to the Mosque of Sidi Jabar.
There were many Mullás present. One of them was
chanting verses of the Qur’án, while another was
addressing the people. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá could hear neither,
so he addressed the one who was speaking, “What art
thou doing? Hast thou not hard the saying of Muḥammad,
that when the Qur’án is read everyone must listen?”
The man turned red and was ashamed and all the other
Mullás looked at each other wonderingly.   

###  9. Story of Mullá Sádiq, the Fanatical <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> 

Then he related another story: During the early years
of his arrival in ‘Akká, he was one night invited to a feast,
where, for the edification of the guests, the Qur’án was
being chanted by a very good singer. {{p156}} The Muḥammadans
having forgotten their reverence for Holy things, and
overlooking the injunction of Muḥammad, smoked and
talked on such occasions, and when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived,
there was a hubbub of confusion, people chatting, smoking
and drinking coffee and tea; while in a corner of the
room two singers chanted the Qur’án with great feeling.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá looked about and saw beside him a very
fanatical <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>, Mullá Sádiq. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked him
whether this was fitting and if, according to the text of
the Qur’án these people should not listen quietly. He answered:
“Yes.” “Then enjoin the law of God upon
them,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told him. Mullá Sádiq arose from
his seat: “Be silent,” he hurled at them with tremendous
fury, and struck at their water-pipes, glasses and cups,
breaking them all in his religious zeal. He then
harangued them for their lack of religious spirit, their
forgetfulness of the Laws of God, and their awful disobedience.
The people were astonished and thought that
he had become a lunatic; but from that time on, at all the
feasts, nothing was served and everybody listened reverently
while the Qur’án was chanted.   

Although Mullá Sádiq considered the Bahá’ís infidels,
yet he used to come every night to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s house;
staying for supper and talking until midnight. He was
so fanatical that if any person deviated one hair’s breadth
from the prescribed formulas of the religion, he would
consider him an atheist.   

###  10. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Love-pat 

The Beloved continued talking and relating several
amusing stories, which made us laugh. When he had
finished he told us that his intention had been to entertain
us. Then he arose to leave and as he passed me he looked
at me with twinkling eyes — and raising his hand brought
it down on my left cheek. {{p157}} It was a hard blow and everybody
enjoyed it, especially myself. It has been some time
since I had received a “love-pat” and I was thinking that
I was somewhat neglected. A “love-pat” from the Master
is worth all the kindnesses of all the people of the world.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 8, 1913. 

###  1. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Does Not Rest 

Let me share with you another translation of the words
of the Beloved revealed to the Persians: —   

“It has been some time since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has been
deprived of correspondence, because he has been engaged
in the delivery of public addresses. He has been speaking
constantly. He has been crying out at every morn
and shunning rest at every eve. On many a night and
day he has been giving the Glad-Tidings of the appearance
of the Kingdom of Mystery in the temples of both
friends and strangers. This delay in correspondence
comes from the lack of time and opportunity; otherwise
you are always before his sight. {{p158}} It is hoped from
the Favor of the Self-Subsistent Lord that your hearts
may be flooded with a new effulgence — that is, that you
may obtain a new joy and ecstasy and leap high like an
inextinguishable flame — so that the light of your love
may illumine all regions.”   

###  2. The Significance of Spiritual Meetings 

“The meetings that thou art holding in thy house are
the means of strengthening the hearts of the spiritual
ones, of guiding the seekers and of awakening the sleepy
ones. These meetings are illumined with the splendor
of divine Providence, and like unto the rose-garden of
Wisdom they are adorned with the flowers of significances
and Ideals. I hope that they will make progress.”   

###  3. The World Is a Farm and the People are Farmers 

“O thou who are attracted by the Fragrances of God!
Every person is a farmer. One sows the seeds of Industry;
another scatters the acorns of commerce, and a
third farms politics. All various agricultural pursuits
culminate in harvests, yet these do not enjoy the blessings
of the eternal springtime, neither do they yield inexhaustible
benefits. but as the friends of God are scattering
seeds in the farms of reality, they will gain an increasing
blessing and will collect throughout centuries and cycles
thousands of harvests. Now praise be to God that thou
art sowing seeds in the ground of Truth and art the
farmer of His Highness the Peerless One.”   

###  4. Spiritual Guidance 

“Thank God that a light of guidance has shone in the
court of thy heart and soul! Thirsty wert thou, thou
didst attain to the fountain of eternal life. {{p159}} Sick wert
thou, thou didst receive the Most Great Antidote of the
Glorious Lord.”   

###  5. Be Seekers of Truth 

“Your letter was received. I supplicated and entreated
at the Threshold of the Kingdom of Abhá to Confer
upon you a new Grace and Bounty; so that those souls
may ever walk in the straight Path, move in the Ancient
Highway of the Lord and be seekers of Truth and
speakers of Truth. This is the utmost hope of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
.”   

###  6. Divine Confirmations 

“O thou servant at the Threshold of the Blessed Perfection!
Offer thou glorification unto the Lord because
the radiant morn of the most great Guidance has appeared
upon the dawning-places of the heart and spirit the
musk-diffusing fragrance of the garden of realities has
reached the nostrils; the divine Confirmations have rent
the veils asunder; the sight and the insight have beheld
the most glorious signs; the dove of the Love of God has
returned to the meadow of the Covenant and the moth
of attraction has circled around the divine Lamp.   

###  7. Selfish People Are Tied with Iron Bands 

Our home was illumined very early this morning by
the presence of the Beloved. He walked in with
confident strides. His face was beaming with joy.
health. And the sun of his countenance irradiated happiness,
so we in turn were made glad for our peaceful life
depends upon his good health.   

As he sat upon a chair he told us that he had slept
soundly the last two nights, and today felt very well.
I could see the effect on his animated face. It had
not any of the former weariness. Then he spoke about
fasting and of how it is necessary for the rich to think {{p160}} of the poor during the month of Ramaḍán. Those souls
who prefer themselves to others are tied with selfish iron
bands, while those who prefer others to themselves are
the benefactors of the human race. Such was the conduct and the
life of Bahá’u’lláh.   

###  8. How ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Built a Bath for Bahá’u’lláh 

The name of Bahá’u’lláh brought to his mind the following
incident: —   

In the military barracks of ‘Akká, there was a small
primitive bath which the Blessed Perfection used occasionally.
After their departure from this place ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
rented a little house in the town. This house consisted
of two stories, two rooms being on the lower
floor and four on the upper, all of very modest proportions.
Now the family was numerous, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
wondered how all those souls could be accommodated in
this small house. Finally thirteen of them agreed to
occupy one room, and here they lived and slept and
worked together. They kept this house for well-nigh
twenty years. It so happened that, although it was small,
it yet contained a primitive bath, and the Blessed Perfection
could use it as often as he wished. At the end
of twenty years, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá rented a much larger house,
but it had no bath. He went to Bahá’u’lláh and asked
permission to build one. The more he begged, the more
definitely was he refused. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, that a
bath could be built for only fifty pounds, but Bahá’u’lláh
did not give his consent.   

After a month had passed he went to an Arab friend
and borrowed from him 250 pounds at two per cent.
This money he took to a merchant who was in former
times a grain-dealer, but who was now out of work. {{p161}} He
told him something to this effect:   

“We will enter into a partnership; the capital will be
from me, the labor from you. With this fund you will
deal in grain for four months. After paying off all the
expenses of rent, etc., and receiving your monthly salary,
we will divide the profit; one-third for you and two-thirds
for me.”   

This agreement was made and the merchant started
the business. After four months they cleared their accounts.
The debt was paid back with its two per cent
interest; the merchant received his one-third profit; all
the other expenses were defrayed, and 30 pounds left in
the balance for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. With that sum he built
a bath in the house of Bahá’u’lláh. This house is kept
intact to the present day.   

###  9. Spiritual Humility and the Story of the King and
the Arab 

Then the conversation turned upon another subject — how outward circumstances, such as wealth, honor, titles
and even spiritual gifts made some people proud.   

Concerning this the Master told a story:   

It is said that at one time a king went traveling incognito.
He put on a humble suit of clothes and started on
his adventures. After a few days journey, during which
he had lost his way in the scorching desert, he finally
reached the tent of an Arab. The Arab, finding the man
exhausted from heat and hunger, dragged him to the
shade. When the king was revived, he asked the Arab
what he had to eat and drink. “I have a goat-skin of wine
and a little goat,” the Arab answered. “Very well, bring
the wine and let the goat be cooked.” The wine was
brought. When the king had drunk one cup, he looked
at the Arab and said: “Do you know who I am?” {{p162}} “No.”
“I am a soldier in the king’s army.” The Arab was glad
to entertain a brave man.   

He drank another cup. “Do you know who I am?”
“Who are you?” “I am a Minister of the King’s Council
Chamber.” “I am delighted to receive such a distinguished
statesman.” A third cup was taken. “Do you
know who I am?” “Well?” “I am the King himself.”
The Arab could stand it no longer. He arose from his
place and took away the goat-skin of wine. “Why do
you do this?” the guest asked, astonished. “Because
I believe that if you drink another cup, you will declare
yourself to be the prophet of God, and a fifth one may
raise you to the station of God himself; so it is better
for you to cool down a little.”   

###  10. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Generosity 

At five o’clock ‘Abdu’l-Bahá returned with Mírzá ‘Alí
Akbar, and went out to call on Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl. He
came back after two hours and complained of fatigue,
because he had been speaking with several Arabs who
had made an appointment to see him. He said, that from
morning until this very moment beggars of all nationalities
and religions had knocked at his door, and that even
now one was waiting outside and he gave me some money
for him.   

His munificence extends to all people. Freely he gives
without distinction for race or color. Our duty in life is
to follow his glorious example, in taking care of the
poor in time of need, and in practicing charity and kindness.
I do not see or hear what he does and says during
the day, but I know that every minute is spent in the
service of others.   

How to make the world better, how to improve the
conditions of mankind, how to raise the standard of moral
consciousness and how to make the hearts more glad is
his hourly preoccupation. {{p163}} Before leaving he told us that
the duty of each believer is to be the servant of the other
and to attend to his brother’s wants. He considered himself
the servant of all the friends of God.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 6, 1913. 

###  1. God’s Favors Measureless 

This morning I was musing upon the events of the past
two years, the extraordinary occurrences concerning the
Cause, the historic tour of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá through the
United States and Europe and the contrast of our present
quiet stay in Ramleh. “What does the future hold for
us?” I asked subconsciously. Bahá’u’lláh has caused
the descent of divine blessings; he has spread before us
a heavenly Table bearing many kinds of spiritual food,
he has left amongst us his son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá — to interpret
his words and to spread his Universal Message and he has
summoned into existence glorious souls all over the world
to promulgate His principles. We must let the lamp of
hope burn, we must free ourselves from regrets or pessimism.
If we fall, we must immediately rise and push
forward. The same God who has assisted others will
come to our help.   

###  2. Spiritual Relationship 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited us this afternoon and we gathered
about him like moths around a candle. Little by little
the friends arrived. Then an American Bahá’í came
with an Arabian believer — a tall young man. {{p164}} The Master
spoke with them on the spiritual union of hearts, irrespective
of color and nationality.   

This spiritual union is one of the wonders of the age,
than an oriental and occidental can meet on common
ground. Although there exists between them no racial,
no patriotic, no political relationship, yet they are able
to enjoy a friendship as though they belong to the same
race. This is a spiritual bond. Often two brothers
reared in the same household are antagonistic, but on this
divine plane others who have no material connections
can in reality be more sympathetic than if they were blood
relations. Happy are you that you have drunk from
this spiritual fountain and have attained to the reality
of existence.   

Then he spoke about his western trip, mentioning the
names of the various cities of America, and of how his
time was spent in those places. Although often he had
not felt well, he had been happy because he could teach
the Cause and spread the Glad-Tidings.   

###  3. A Walk through the Streets and the Radiance of
the Star of Hope 

At sunset he ordered tea and in the calm atmosphere
of a lovely eastern evening, we felt his power more than
ever. He is the King of our hearts and spirits and our
love for him is increasing daily. He left very quietly,
followed by the Arab believer. I felt a new ray of hope
dawning upon the horizon of my soul. After dinner I
wished to be alone so that I might contemplate the divine
sweetness of the Beloved. Walking through the streets
I looked up and millions of stars were shining in their
accustomed glory. The night was beautiful. {{p165}} The Eastern
sky was radiant. The stars were the shining lamps
of God. At last I sat down on a broken wall and I looked
about me. Thinking upon the past, I became confident
for the future. God in his bounty has guided the ship
of my destiny so far and he will continue to do the same.
I returned with a light step. On my way back I met
three other believers. They are sincere in their strivings
and longing to be of more useful service. How confident
they were! How simple! how spiritual! how glorious
their faith! they inspired me with a greater faith. In
the darkness there arose a light, full of radiance and
beauty. I entered the house very happy. My heart was
singing. The future was in the hands of God.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 7, 1913. 

###  1. The Beauty and Charm of the Palaces of Ramleh 

From my room I see the great clock of the New Victoria
Hotel, wherein the Beloved stayed from time to
time. The manager with much pride shows to the guests
the various rooms occupied by the Master. He knows
something about the Cause, and recognizes the great
honor and blessing bestowed upon him and his hotel.
When the Master was here the last time, he gave two
large feasts just before his departure for America. There
are a few other hotels and houses in which the Beloved
has lived periodically. The homes of the Pá<u>sh</u>ás are
really wonderful specimens of the best Renaissance
architecture. {{p166}} They very much resemble the houses and
villas I have seen at Nice. Wonderful palaces, furnished
with a taste truly magnificent, and are enclosed within
gardens, the beauty and charm of which rival the fairy-lands
of the artists and the poets. These “villas” are
surrounded by walls from two to four yards high. The
principal avenues are macadamized and clean and the
narrow streets are also very much like the garden paths
of Nice. As one walks through them the perfume of
the flowers is inhaled, the branches of the trees overhanging
the walls give a cool, inviting shade and the climbing
vines add to the charming verdancy. A man passing
through the streets and observing the houses, sees all the
windows tightly shut. The stranger may think that they
are not inhabited, but on inquiring about this custom
of closing the windows, he is politely informed that as
the owner is Muḥammadan, the blinds are drawn, so
that no foreign eyes may gaze upon the dark beauties of
the women.   

###  2. The Egyptian Pá<u>sh</u>ás are Proud of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
His Philosophy of Religion 

Several of the houses of these Pá<u>sh</u>ás are honored by
the presence of the Master, for they admire him and appreciate
his teachings of tolerance and broad-mindedness.
It is very strange that although these men do not believe
in the Cause, yet they boast before strangers about the
existence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.   

A very prominent Pá<u>sh</u>á, who was an admirer of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
, received from time to time some English periodicals
with accounts of the Bahá’í movements, among them was
the Christian Commonwealth which contained an article
explaining the Cause.   

After showing the article to a visiting Englishman,
the Pá<u>sh</u>á said: —   

>  “We have produced in the Orient a man such as ‘Abbás
Effendi, who alone visited Europe and America, and who
through the sheer force of his personality and the
wonderful soundness and brilliancy of his philosophy, captivated
the pulpits and platforms, revolutionized the current
of western thoughts, opened before your faces vistas
of glorious ideals, and drew to his audiences thousands
of men and women who were deeply attracted to his humane
and divine wisdom, while the Press of the West
from one end to another had but one tongue by which to
praise his many virtues and to elucidate his system of
religion and philosophy. {{p167}} Yes, we are proud of him. We
honor him because he comes from the heart of the Orient.
He represents us, he utters our ideals and longings. You
have never sent us a man who could travel in the Orient
and deliver lectures as ‘Abbás Effendi has done in the
West.” 

Thus these people are spreading the principles in a
most effective manner, because they are men of great
influence, although not “believers” in the Bahá’í Movement.   

###  3. A Call from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His Encouragement 

This morning the Master did not come to our house but
passed by, asking for Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar. During the
day he came in two or three times, but for only a few
minutes. His health has improved much. He seems very
busy, for he is out often, paying visits to this or that
person.   

In the morning I was told many interesting stories of
how certain people had become Bahá’ís and the manner
in which some of the believers taught. {{p168}} These stories
are really worth recording, for they illustrate the peculiar
disposition of a people who may be instructed by a line
quoted at the right time, but refuse to listen
to all kinds of logical arguments.   

In the evening the Beloved came with a number of
friends, tea was prepared according to his directions and
served by himself. He stayed for half an hour, speaking
now and then about the Cause and encouraging the Pilgrims
to teach when they are back again among their
associates and relatives.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 8, 1913. 

###  1. A Practical Lesson in Cleanliness 

Today I played the part of house-cleaner and cook.
I spent most of my time in the kitchen cleaning the dishes,
washing the utensils, scrubbing the floor and dusting the
ceiling and the cupboard. It was an object lesson to our
cook, who does not know the simple ways of cleanliness.
When I left the kitchen all the Persians came in and admired
the spotlessness of everything. The cook was
most willing to learn, but there had been no one who
would take a day off to demonstrate a method of tidiness
to him   

My parents did not teach me any of these things;
in fact did not know them, was the way he explained
this lack of knowledge.   

Most of the simple, loving folks here have plenty of
religion. They are honest, truthful, hospitable, but they
lack the knowledge of hygiene and sanitation. {{p169}} Their
children are allowed to remain dirty; in many cases they
do not dress them well for fear of bringing them to
notice and of possibly attracting the “Evil Eye.” Woe
betide anyone if he praises or admires the beauty of
the child of a Muḥammadan! What these people need
is a practical knowledge and the inculcation of sanitary
laws. Once they learn these, they will forget their superstitions;
the outlook of their cramped lives will be expanded,
the light of intelligence will shine, and the beauty
of holiness appear. The most important thing for them
is the supreme knowledge of cleanliness which is next
to godliness. The Bahá’í Revelation is in inculcating this
lesson, and they are learning as fast as opportunity is
offered to them. Bahá’u’lláh has said that cleanliness is
the perfume of paradise!   

###  2. The Story of the Dervish and his Resignation 

While I was busy with my house-cleaning, the Master
was dictating Tablets for the Oriental believers. In the
morning he came to see the pilgrims, but most of them
were not yet up. However, within a few minutes they
were in his presence. He asked the cook what he was
going to prepare for us. The cook did not know and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
demanded from one after the other what they
liked, and finally the decision was made. Then the
Master told us the story of a Dervish, as follows: When
Bahá’u’lláh with his family were leaving Ba<u>gh</u>dád, a Dervish
begged ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s permission to join the party.
He was told that the trip would be most difficult, but the
Dervish was willing to accept all manner of hardships so
he traveled with the party as far as Constantinople. Then
when they left for Adrianople, he stayed behind but joined
them later, for having become accustomed to associate
with the Bahá’ís, he could not live without them. {{p170}} In
Adrianople, he rented a room in an adjoining Mosque
with another friend, and for some time they lived together
peacefully. One day the Dervish came to Bahá’u’lláh,
saying: “My friend attacked me this morning
and gave me a sound beating, but I said nothing. I was
in a state of utmost resignation. Then after half an
hour he returned, kissed my hands and said: ‘Verily, you
have attained the stage of great merit, you are now a
saint.’” Bahá’u’lláh, listening with interest to this story,
said laughingly: “if he beats you another time and you
demonstrate such resignation, he may believe that you
have attained the station of Prophethood.”   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Amid the Roses 

In the afternoon, we met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a garden
walking among the lovely roses. He was talking on the
mission of the Manifestation of God.   

Before sunset we went to a Bahá’í meeting in the
house of <u>Kh</u>urasání. They expected ‘Abdu’l-Bahá but
he did not come, because he was very tired on account of
the activities of the day. In the evening a number of
Arabs called on him in his own house. One of them had
composed an eloquent poem in his honor, and read it
aloud. They stayed until twelve o’clock and went away
impressed with his knowledge and wisdom.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Raises the Call of the Kingdom. 

In a Tablet revealed to the Persian believers he says:   

“O YE FRIENDS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ: — It is now three
years that, like unto a nestles and shelterless bird, I
have been wandering through mountains and plains and
flying over the wilderness and Sahara. I rested not one
moment, neither did I tarry long anywhere. Constantly
was I moving and traveling. {{p171}} The cry of the Kingdom
of Abhá was raised and the most great Glad-tidings
penetrated throughout those vast and remote regions.
The Flag of the Cause of God was unfurled over every
hill and waved over every country. As I was occupied
day and night, spreading the world-consuming call of
the Cause, I failed to correspond with the friends of the
heart and the soul, but as soon as I returned to the Orient,
notwithstanding my indisposition, I immediately started
to correspond. For the utmost desire of my heart and
spirit is to remember the believers and to mention the
names of the friends, especially those who have been at
all times, the objects of tests and who are submerged in
the sea of trials; notwithstanding this, with infinite firmness
and steadfastness, you withstood the attack of the
waves, underwent bravely violent storms, and guided the
Ark to the shore of salvation. Therefore I am greatly
pleased and most satisfied with the believers of Bu<u>sh</u>rúyyih,
Kheir-ol-Gara and Fárán and all those of
<u>Kh</u>urasán. I hope that in the future their flame of enthusiasm,
and the fire of their devotion may be enkindled
more and more. Upon ye, and upon the maid-servants
of the Merciful be Bahá’u’l-Abhá.”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 9, 1913. 

###  1. The Bounties of God 

No matter where we go and what we do, the protecting
hand of God overshadows us. {{p172}} We are tenderly and
wistfully taken care of by Him who rules the world of
Creation. In His mighty grasp He holds the scepter of
Guidance and in His hand He carries the golden crown
of the heavenly Glad-tidings. He illumines the hearts
of the sincere ones with the light of Providence and summons
all the nations to come under the Tent of His
Mercy. He quickens the dead with the Breaths of the
Holy Spirit and inspires hearts with divine Knowledge.
He adorns the heavens with countless scintillating stars
and commands the winds to blow from every direction.
He causes the water to gush out of the adamantine rock
and irrigates the soil with the rain of Reality. He reveals
unto man the mysteries of His Kingdom and
spreads abroad the vision of Paradise! Glory be unto
Him for this Manifest Bestowal. Thanks be unto Him
for this Evident Grace! Praise be unto Him for this
spiritual outpouring!   

His true servants adore Him under all conditions and
circumstances. They obey His will and follow His commandments.
They lose the self and attain to the station
of renunciation. The love of humanity flows through
the stream of their lives. They become the spiritual
springtimes which are followed by no autumns. They
become the guardians of the rights of men. They are the
angels of the Supreme Concourse, the fruitful trees of
the Orchard of the Almighty and the singing nightingales
of the meadow of Truth. It is the hope of every
lover of humanity to become the center of these merciful
qualities, to attract these praiseworthy attributes, to surround
himself with these wonderful virtues and to reflect
the rays of the sun of righteousness!

2. A Tablet for the Believers of Iṣfahán, Persia 

A Tablet was revealed yesterday for the believers of
Iṣfahán. {{p173}} Iṣfahán is my native home and I have a
secret predilection for that place. The Tablet is through a
Siyyid Asadu’lláh, a native of that city who is a fine
young man amongst the present pilgrims. After having
a most memorable visit of many days with the Blessed
Master, he leaves tomorrow via Constantinople for his
home. Here is the translation of the Tablets: —   

O YE FRIENDS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ! His Honor Siyyid
Asadu’lláh arrived in Alexandria and a meeting was obtained.
When he received permission for his departure
he mentioned your names and asked for a Tablet.
But ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, like unto a bird who has been constantly
flying for many days and nights is exhausted.
He has not rested for one moment, and is in the utmost
fatigue and weariness, to such an extent that he has
not the endurance for writing even one word. Notwithstanding
this, through the tremendous power of the Love
of God and the rising of the waves of affection for the
believers of God, I am thus engaged; so you may realize
how this heart is attracted toward those blessed souls,
and is the captive of the memory of the friends.   

“In short, it has been some time since, like unto a
Breeze wafting, I have been traveling in the regions of
the West, but under all conditions and circumstances, I
have remembered the friends of the East. At every moment,
the spirit enjoyed a new exhilaration, and often I
regretted the fact that I was far from the opportunity
of association with those faithful believers. I did not
choose any plane as my shelter. One night I was crossing
a mountain, and spending the day on the plains and in
the flowerbeds. At one time I was traveling in the
midst of the great ocean and at another, landing on the
shore of a continent. {{p174}} Day and night I raised my voice
and cried out in the name of His Highness the Almighty!
Now at last I have reached Alexandria and have looked
in the faces of the Oriental believers. Praise be to God
that I beheld such pilgrims who are in the utmost of
supplication and adoration of God. I have also remembered
you. It is hoped that the Sun of Reality may so
shine upon the East that the West may become illumined
with one of its effulgent rays and that the friends of
Persia may be the means of the union of the hearts of the
people of other countries and arise for the guidance of the
inhabitants of the earth. Praise be to God that the confirmation
of the Blessed Perfection descend incessantly
like vernal showers and that merciful reinforcements are
constantly bringing assistance. Therefore, O ye believers
of God, avail yourselves of this opportunity, be ye engaged
in the enlightenment of souls and think ye of the
unlimited illumination of your hearts. Enlighten the
East. Perfume the West and let nostrils inhale the
Fragrances.   

Upon ye be Bahá’u’l-Abhá.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

###  3. Contrast between the Oriental and Occidental
Houses 

This morning the Beloved paid us an early visit. He
called each one by name and our hearts glowed with unchangeable
love. He said to the pilgrims that it was the
wonderful Love of God that gave him the impetus to
write so many Tablets to the friends of Persia. Otherwise
physically it would have been impossible. Then he
said that he could not sleep last night, because he had
been submerged in a sea of thought and reflection. He
pointed out the contrast between the Oriental and Occidental
houses by saying, that all the Oriental houses were
enclosed within beautiful courts and gardens. {{p175}} If a person
cannot sleep during the night, he can go out in the
court, walk around quietly, commune with the stars, and
pass the night in the open. But one cannot leave the
Occidental houses except to go into the streets.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Gives Money to the Poor 

In the afternoon he returned and asked for Mírzá
Munír. While he was standing in front of the house,
an Arab stopped and begged for money to feed his children,
because he was a stranger in the city. I wondered
whether he was telling the truth, but the Master gave
him one Majídi, which is quite a sum in this part of the
world. Then he went into the garden nearby. For more
than one hour he sat silently, his eyes half-closed; only
now and then opening them to look at the flowers, and
thus he remained in the garden until sunset.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 10, 1913. 

###  1. How ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Dictates Tablets to His Friends
in All Parts of the World 

This morning I was called into the presence of the Beloved.
He was very happy. He asked for the letters
which have come from America and Europe. I returned
home and brought a full-sized package. As soon as he
started to dictate, and the words of wisdom like unto
a sparkling stream flowed from his blessed mouth, he
was a transfigured person. He sat immovable on the
sofa, his eyes most of the time shut, but his heart a waving
ocean of revelation. {{p176}} Now he revealed a Tablet to
a believer in Constantinople, and again to a friend in
Rangoon, India; Stuttgart and Switzerland, London and
Paris, New York and Honolulu, Washington and Boston
were represented. How wonderful and significant
appears to me this golden net-work of spiritual correspondence,
reaching to the different parts of the earth!
This correspondence is not based upon any commercial
or material scheme. It is the eternal plan of God, to diffuse
the fragrance of the spiritual rose and scatter the
rays of the Divine Sun! Every day an ideal Congress
of religions and nations is held in the rather small room
of the Beloved and he presides over the proceedings with
a dignity and wisdom that is nothing short of miraculous.
Some of the friends who became the recipients
of the Tablets are as follows: Miss Beatrice Irwin, Miss
Rhoda Nicols, Mrs. Isabel Fraser, Mr. Ch. Remey, Miss
A. Boylin, Miss 0. Schwartz, ‘Abbás Butt Ally, Mr.
Ekstein, Madame d’Ange d’Astre, J. Miller, Dr. Skinner,
J. Wieland, Miss Alma Knoblock, etc., etc. Toward the
end, the Master was so moved that he got up from his seat
and began to walk to and fro while continuing dictation.
I tried to keep up with the rapidity of his uttered words.
When I mentioned the name of one of the believers, his
whole countenance changed, and he was very happy, saying
that he loved him, because he was very sincere in
the Cause. In the Tablet, addressed to this particular
Bahá’í, he said:   

“May His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh be thy Confirmer and
Helper! May the Effulgence of the Sun of Reality be
the light of thy path! May the sea of Divine Confirmation
cast its waves over thee! May the cloud of Celestial
Grace pour upon thee! May the Breeze of Providence
be the cause of the fragrance of thy nostrils! May
the treasury of the Kingdom be thy wealth! This is the
prayer of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in thy behalf.”   

What a heavenly prayer! Then he revealed a Tablet,
on the sinfulness of backbiting, evil-finding and gossip,
which must be spread all over the Bahá’í world. {{p177}} Soaring
again toward the spiritual realms of eloquence and pausing
for a moment, he said, if these Tablets do not move
and stir the hearts out of their sleep and do not spur them
into activity, they are harder than stones; because in this
condition of weakness, he was writing to them with such
love and tenderness.   

It was about 11:30 that I left his presence. In the
afternoon he went to the rose-garden, and while sitting
on the soft grass dictated many more Tablets to the Persian
believers.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Speaks on Theosophy 

In the evening he came to our house. He sat on the
veranda. Many believers were gathered around him.
He spoke on the doctrines of the Theosophists, of his
interview with Mrs. A. Besant in London and with other
prominent Theosophists in the West, about the story of
the boy who is being educated in Oxford to become the
manifestation of God, and a most instructive exposition
of the principles of reincarnation which was greatly beneficial
to all. Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl said afterward:   

“I have read many books on this subject, but have
never seen anywhere, such clear and lucid explanations.”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 11, 1913. 

###  1. The Spread of the Bahá’í Cause Similar to the
Spreading of Early Christianity 

Three of our pilgrims — one from Iṣfahán, another
from Yazd and a third from ‘I<u>sh</u>qabád, departed for their
respective countries, carrying away the Glad-tidings of
the Kingdom of Abhá. As they travel along, from country
to country, before reaching their native lands, they
will cheer many hearts, console many despondent spirits,
teach many souls, and diffuse far and wide the fragrances
of the Roses of Love and Affection. How exactly
parallel is the promotion of this Movement to that of
early Christianity! Whole-hearted, spiritual, zealous
men and women, without the expectation of any salary,
are spreading the Cause throughout all the countries of
the world! Their only reward is the good-pleasure of
the Lord of Mankind. They are affected neither by the
praise nor the blame of the people! They work for the
sake of God. They are always in good humor, ever
teaching their fellowmen the ways of charity and freedom,
amity and concord. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent for the pilgrims
early this morning, so that he might speak to them
words of blessing and comfort. He praised the steadfastness
of the Persian believers before the executioner’s
sword and under the severest trials; how they danced
with joy when they were surrounded by persecution, and
how they faced martyrdom with benign faith and smiling
countenances!   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets Are the Never-fading Roses
of the Kingdom of Abhá 

Early in the morning I went down to the sea, and as
I passed the house of the Beloved, I saw him walking
in his room and talking to the Pilgrims who were about
to leave. {{p179}} At four o’clock he sent for Mírzá Munír. In
the rose-garden nearby many Tablets were dictated for
the Eastern and Western Bahá’ís. These Tablets carry
with themselves, not only the ideal fragrances of the
paradise of Abhá, but the perfume of the flowers before
his loving vision. They have a special charm and significance
to me and as I translate or read them, the beautiful
rose-garden with its luxuriant verdancy and fragrant
flowers passes before my sight, and I look upon each one
of these Tablets as a spiritual rose, never-fading, imperishable,
sent as a divine gift to the friends of God.
These roses of the Kingdom of Abhá are being scattered
all over the earth, to perfume the nostrils of mankind,
not only in these days, but throughout the coming generations.
Just think of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, visualize him in your
mind! He is walking among the flower-beds, pausing
here to pick a rose, there a violet, inhaling them with
the sweetness of his spirit and dictating words of knowledge
and wisdom!   

###  3. The Most Great Sin Is Backbiting 

Herein I translate the important Tablet on backbiting.
It is written to Doctor M. G. Skinner of Washington,
D.C.   

“He is God.   

O THOU MY DOCTOR!   

“Thy letter was received. Thou hast written regarding
thy aims. How blessed are these aims! especially
for the suppression of backbiting (gossip, fault-finding,
etc). I hope that you may become confirmed therein;
because the worst human quality and the most great sin is
backbiting; {{p180}} most especially when it emanates from the
tongues of the believers of God. If some means might
be devised so that the doors of backbiting could be shut
eternally and each one of the believers unsealed his tongue
only for praise of the other, then the Teachings of His
Holiness Bahá’u’lláh would be spread, hearts illuminated,
spirits glorified and the human world attain to Everlasting
Felicity.   

“I hope that the believers of God will shun backbiting
completely, (gossip-making and fault-finding) and each
one praising the other cordially, and believing that backbiting
is the cause of divine wrath; that if a person back-bites
to the extent of one word he may become dishonored
amongst all people: because the most hateful characteristic
of man is fault-finding. One must expose the
praiseworthy qualities of the souls and not their evil
attributes. The friends must overlook each other’s
shortcomings and speak only of their virtues — not of
their faults.   

“It is related that his Holiness Christ — may my life
be a sacrifice to Him — one day accompanied by His
Apostles, passed by the corpse of a dead animal. One of
them remarked: ‘How putrid has become this animal!’
The other exclaimed: ‘How it is deformed!’ A third
cried out: ‘What an odor! How cadaverous looking!’
But His Holiness Christ said: — ‘Look at its teeth! How
white they are!’ Consider that He did not look at all
for the defects of that animal, nay rather, He searched
well until He found its beautiful white teeth. {{p181}} He observed
the whiteness of the teeth only and entirely overlooked
the deformity of its body, the dissolution of its
organs and its evil odor!   

“This should be the attribute of the children of the
Kingdom!   

“This should be the conduct and the manner of the real
Bahá’ís!   

“I hope that all the believers will attain to this lofty
station.   

Upon thee and upon them be Bahá’u’l-Abhá.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

Toward evening the Beloved called at the apartment
of Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl and finding there a few young Arab
students, spoke to them on general subjects. For the
present Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl is writing a book which when
finished may be considered the chief work of his busy
and eventful life.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 12, 1913. 

###  1. The Bahá’ís Must Start a Forward Movement of
Teaching 

This is the time when the believers must give attention
to the spreading of the Teachings among those people
who have not yet heard of this Cause. There should be
a general forward movement in all the Bahá’í Assemblies.
The supreme question of spreading the Lights of the
Kingdom of Abhá must gain the upper hand. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
desires to see the results of the work of the friends.
We must recruit new soldiers for the Army of Abhá.
The friends should avail themselves of this great opportunity.
They should loosen the tongues of eloquence and
invite all men to the heavenly Banquet. They should
speak with fire and let the spirit of God inspire their
hearts. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is crying: Teach, Speak, Spread the
Message! Can we remain indifferent, speechless, and {{p182}} voiceless? No! a thousand times No! Why has God
given us tongues? To speak about his Grace, to proclaim
His Manifestation, to raise our voices in public
meetings and gathering-places, to widen the circle of
human thought and to teach His Principles.   

Because ‘Abdu’l-Bahá travelled throughout America and
Europe, the zeal and enthusiasm of the Persian teachers
have been increased a hundred times. We have seen him
with our own eyes, heard his teachings with our own ears.
The slogan of every Bahá’í must be: “Let us teach the
people brotherhood and tolerance!”   

###  2. Mrs. Getsinger and Her Forthcoming Trip to India 

This morning the Beloved sent for me. He was feeling
well. Mrs. Getsinger was called into the room and
the plan of her journey to India discussed. Since her
arrival she has been living with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s family
which is presided over by the Greatest Holy Leaf! Then
the Beloved dictated a few Tablets and cablegrams. In the
afternoon he passed by the house, followed by Shoghi
Effendi, and asked for Mírzá Munír. Many Tablets
were revealed in the garden. No one is allowed to go
there during these hours unless permitted by him. One
of the Tablets is to Mr. Ekstein of Stuttgart. He is a
fine Bahá’í and translated the words of the Master on
many occasions during our trip to that city. The Tablet
is as follows:   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Praises the German Bahá’ís in Tablet 

“O THOU ILLUMINED MAN!   

“The days that I spent with thee in Stuttgart I shall
never forget, for at all times we associated with the
Assistance of the Breaths of the Holy Spirit. {{p183}} The power
of Confirmation of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh waved over
those meetings, the lights of the kingdom shone forth
from the horizon of Abhá, the invincible aids descended
successively, the hearts were in the utmost joyousness,
the spirits were exhilarated with the Divine Glad-tidings,
and each one of the believers like unto a candle. On
this account those days will never be forgotten   

“Now it is my hope that after my departure; the Fire
of the Love of God may flame forth with greater intensity,
and that thou mayest sing a heavenly melody in
every gathering.... I am most grateful and satisfied
with the believers of Stuttgart. Truly I say that they
are blessed souls. I will never forget them for one moment.
The thought of them makes me very happy....”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 13, 1913. 

###  1. The Story of the Man Who Made It Appear That He
Was a Bahá’í in 1830, while the Movement
Began in 1844 

This morning the Master came in to inquire about
the health of his servants. We responded joyfully to
his humorous questions about fasting, eating, etc. After
walking a few minutes he sat down and corrected the
Tablets which had been dictated during the last two
days. {{p184}} Then, in connection with his remarks about those
persons who profess to be Bahá’ís because they expect
some material reward, he related the following story: —   

“When the Bahá’ís were living in Ba<u>gh</u>dád there was a
very prominent man who used often to come to see
Bahá’u’lláh. He sat in His Presence with the greatest
respect and listened attentively to his utterances. One
day he tried to express his faith and belief in the Cause
with all apparent sincerity and devotion. ‘Yes, my Lord!’
he concluded his talk, ‘I thoroughly believe in this Cause.
In the year 1830, one or the great teachers of this Movement
passed by our city. I met him and he talked with
me for several days and his words convinced me of the
validity of this revelation. From that time on I have
been a believer.’” Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá laughed, saying,
that this man did not know that the movement was inaugurated
only in 1844 and so, in order to convince Bahá’u’lláh
of the genuineness of his belief, he had set the
time of his acceptance 14 years before the declaration of
the Báb!   

###  2. The Story of the Fifteen Robbers of Ba<u>gh</u>dád 

At another time there were fifteen robbers in Ba<u>gh</u>dád.
They raided many houses during the nights. The government
and police were unable to find their whereabouts.
One night they robbed the stores of several Persian merchants
and according to the law of capitulation, the
Persian Consul did his best to catch them. This Consul
was, however, very greedy and avaricious, and he thought
more of his personal profit than of finding the robbers
and of giving back to the merchants their stolen goods.
One morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arose early and came out of
the house. He saw in the court fifteen uncouth men
waiting for him. {{p185}} Their spokesman told him that they
were the band of robbers and that in order to escape the
wrath of the Consul and his rapacity, they had come to
take refuge under the shelter of Bahá’u’lláh and become
Bahá’ís. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá inquired about their whereabouts
gave them a little advice, and sent them away. Then
knowing that if the goods were taken by the Consul, they
would never be returned to their owners, he sent one of
the believers to the chief of the band, requiring him to
return everything, which he did without any protest.
The merchants in turn, received quietly all their stolen
goods without the mediumship of the Consul. But when
the Consul heard of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s part in this affair, he
was very wroth, because the matter had been taken out
of his jurisdiction. He had expected to fatten his
pockets, and not succeeding in this he forever afterward
tried to injure the Bahá’ís on every occasion.   

Among these robbers there was one by the name of
Haydar. As a punishment for his former raids, the government
had cut off both his hands. He was, notwithstanding
this handicap, the cleverest of them all. One
morning, a Bahá’í came to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, saying that
last night his money which was sewed in a special
pocket of his vest had been stolen. He did not know
how, and he wondered who had done the deed. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
told him to go and bring his vest, and when it was
before him, he observed that the pocket was not ripped
with a knife, but chewed to pieces with teeth. He did
not say anything, but sent for Haydar. When Haydar
arrived, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told him: “Thou hast stolen the
money of this poor man. Give it back to him.” He tried
to deny it, but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: “Look at this vest!
Thou hast chewed the pocket with thy teeth; it is not torn
with a knife as any other man would have done were
he in possession of his hands.” No, he would not confess
that he had stolen it. Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ordered the bastinado
to be brought in. {{p186}} After receiving a few lashes
on the soles of his feet, he brought out of his pocket the
small bundle of money and gave it to its owner. Then
he was released.   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Talks about Helping the Poor and Needy 

Before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s departure for America, the poor
of all nationalities came to him, Persians and Turks,
Arabs and Syrians, Greeks and Europeans, belonging to
all religions and faiths. He gladly helped everyone
without any distinction for race or color; but this year he
could not give to the same extent, because the expenses of
his travels in America and Europe had totaled a great
sum. Even now he was under a heavy debt. However,
although these difficulties existed, he would not send one
man away without satisfying him and relieving his immediate
needs. The worst condition in life is, when one
is in urgent want of the means of livelihood. It is indeed
very sad when a person begs for assistance to be unable
to lighten his burden, or to contribute anything toward
his relief.   

###  4. The Story of the Muḥammadan Mullá and the
Questioner 

Then, changing the mode of his expression, he said:   

“One day a layman went to a Mullá and asked several
questions. The Mullá did not answer him. The man
then said: “Have you not read in the Qur’án ‘You must
not turn away a questioner?’” The Mullá in turn rejoined: — “Hast thou not also read the injunction in the
same holy book, ‘Give thou not thy possessions to the
fools.’ {{p187}} Now, my possessions are the ideals of knowledge
and of Truth. I must protect them from intruders.”   

Then he interpreted a dream of Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar and
left our precincts to attend to the many works of charity
which call for his personal attention.   

###  5. Arrival of a New Pilgrim 

A new pilgrim arrived today from Beirut. He is an
old Bahá’í and has a most interesting history. He has a
limited education, but out of the clearness of his heart
and the beauty of his faith, he interprets the verses of the
Qur’án and can carry on most instructive discussions on
spiritual subjects. The Master has expressed a wish that
he should interpret in his presence, one Qur’ánic verse
every day.   

###  6. With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Rose-garden

When I returned from Alexandria in the afternoon I
was told that the Master had asked for me. I went immediately
to the garden. Seeing me standing near the
door, he permitted me to enter and to take a seat. He
was walking in the avenue fronting a most charming
rose-garden, and dictating Tablets to Mírzá Munír.
Shohgi Effendi was there also. For nearly three hours,
the limpid stream of revelation flowed to irrigate the
parched ground of hearts in distant climes! Just as the
sun was sinking behind the western horizon, he revealed
a most touching prayer. His voice was like the music
of the spheres, now chanting in a clear rich voice, now
in a low, sweet undertone. The effect made us forgetful
of everything. The dusk of the evening, the murmur
of the breeze through the roses and trees, the unbroken
calmness of the atmosphere, the spiritual beauty of the
presence of the Master, and then as we looked up, the
twinkling stars all combined to weave around our hearts
a garland of spiritual enchantment! {{p188}} We were in reality
worshiping the glorious King of Kings in the holiest
moment of our lives! The prayer was a supplication
to the throne of the Almighty for the purification of
souls and the spiritualization of hearts, — in order that
men might sing the praises of their Lord, and cause the
ringing cries of “Ya Bahá’u’l-Abhá” to ascend from their
meeting places to the Supreme Concourse.   

As we left the garden, I carried with me that wonderful
prayer of the Beloved! On the wings of Light it had
ascended to the throne of the Almighty and had been accepted
by the Ruler of Mankind.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 14, 1913. 

###  1. Bahá’í Schools in Ká<u>sh</u>án and Ṭihrán and Their
Examinations 

Yesterday afternoon the Master read to us a letter
received from Ká<u>sh</u>án, giving the details of the examinations
of the children of the Bahá’í school in that city. He
said that there were more than 700 persons present on
Commencement Day and that all the pupils examined
came out with flying colors. The school has become a
credit to the Bahá’í community and every one speaks about
it. Another letter from Ṭihrán was given us by the
Master to read. It contained a graphic description of the
examinations at the school of Tarbíyát. {{p189}} Thirty students
together with the President of the school and the teachers
presented themselves before the Board of Examiners,
appointed by the government in the College of Darel-Fonoun.
Twenty-one out of the thirty pupils received
their diplomas. This shows the earnestness of these students
of Tarbíyát and their thorough education. After
this examination which lasted several days, the Faculty
of the school gave a public reception, to which more than
2000 persons were invited. The school of Tarbíyát is well
known throughout Persia as a Bahá’í institution. It
ranks high for its educational standard, and its Branch
for the girls is headed by Miss Lillian Kappes. Notwithstanding
many stumbling blocks in its path, it has
been slowly, but surely forging ahead. Its progress and
steady advancement is very dear and near to the heart of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He hopes that it may become a wonderful
influence for culture and refinement throughout Persia;
and those friends in America who are assisting it are
helping the Cause in an unqualified manner. Not only
the American friends have realized the importance of this
fact, but also the Indian Bahá’ís in their far-off country.   

###  2. The Orient-Occident Unity 

In a Tablet revealed two or three days ago to the believers
of Rangoon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says:   

“Whatever contribution you may send to the school
of Tarbíyát is in the estimation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, most acceptable.
In this we observe the aim of God working
for the advancement of public education in Persia. The
Western friends have rendered a worthy service to the
Tarbíyát School through the instrumentality of the
Orient-Occident Unity in Washington. It is hoped that
this channel of philanthropy will be continually widened,
its various interests solidified, its annual scholarships kept
up and increased in number, and its wholesome, disinterested
influence expanded. {{p190}} Inasmuch as it is a universal
undertaking, and every universal undertaking is
divine in origin, its activities will continue. God has confirmed
this work in many ways and will confirm those
who are serving it.”   

###  3. Talk of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Writer 

This morning the Beloved sent Ba<u>sh</u>ír for me. When
I stood in his presence, he spoke with great tenderness.
In his face there was the serenity of the Kingdom, the
newness of the spring and the freshness of roses.
Through his tongue the angels of love and affection uttered
words of truth and beauty. I could almost hear
the aeolian harps playing infinite chords of sound and
color. My spirit was transported into the seventh heaven
of ecstasy!   

He told me that he had allowed me to stay near him,
so that he might educate me according to his own standards.
As soon as he observed that I had attained to that
standard, he would send me away. Daily I must prepare
myself for the services of the Cause. I must live in such
a manner that wherever I go, I may attract from the
Kingdom of Abhá the divine Confirmations of the
Blessed Perfection. Like unto the nightingale I must
sing; like unto the bird I must soar; like unto the tree
I must bear fruit; like unto the breeze I must waft over
mountains and deserts, and similar unto the artist I must
paint. Sanctified and holy I must occupy my time with
the diffusion of the Lights of the Kingdom, and strive
in the enkindlement of hearts and the regeneration of
souls. I must be the servant of the Blessed Beauty and
create a great reverberation in the spheres of thought and
ideals. I must protect my eyes in order to behold His
beauty, and my ears, so as to hear His music. {{p191}} ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wish for me is that I may be trained in accordance
with the nature of his great teachings, and try to
walk in the footsteps of his mission. Then when he
sends me away, he may ever receive, glad news from me,
so that he may declare that his son is the spreader of the
Cause of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh, the conqueror of the
cities of the hearts, the torch-bearer in the highway of
guidance, and a radiant star in the heaven of the Supreme
Concourse. There is much work to be done. Gird up
the loins of endeavor. Be on the alert. Be wakeful and
pray. In a short while he shall send me away. The
time is coming soon. Now daily he is watching me, just
as the gardener watches the growth of the plant with
solicitude and care. Like unto the magnet I must draw
the Confirmations of the Kingdom of Abhá unto myself
and be connected with the most Great Sea. I must
not rest one moment. I must seek no comfort; yea, yea
I must walk in his footsteps. He declared by the Blessed
Beauty that there was no other ideal in his mind except
the ideal of servitude at the Threshold of Bahá’u’lláh. I
must live eternally in this condition. All other conditions
are non-existent when compared with this supreme
state — the guidance of God. I must spread this ideal
among the people. Bahá’u’lláh alone is my faithful
helper and supporter. The time for my service has come
I must be confident and rest assured that the Blessed Perfection
is with me....   

These utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá flashed through my
mind and heart like so many rays of light. I was dazzled.
>From the height of authority and inspiration he was
speaking. I was moved to tears and my whole body was
shaken to the core; then the Beloved, seeing my condition,
changed his tone and spoke of other things. He
dictated several Tablets for the believers of Persia. Then
I left his presence. {{p192}} I walked as a man in a dream.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Praises Mrs. Goodall and Mrs. Getsinger 

In the afternoon he passed by the house. He called
me to go with him. In reply to a cablegram to Mrs.
Goodall, he had received an answer which had made him
very happy. He said that she was his beloved, heavenly
daughter, that she was the daughter of Bahá’u’lláh, ever
serving the Cause with a rare faithfulness and magnanimity.
He also spoke very lovingly about Mrs. Getsinger.   

He said that if Mrs. Getsinger conducts herself according
to his instructions she shall move India and teach
many souls. Her words are endowed with Spiritual efficacy.
Severed from all else save God she must go to
India, relying upon Bahá’u’lláh for Confirmation.   

I gave the Master a list of the names of the Bahá’í Assemblies
of America and Europe requesting him to reveal
a Tablet for each assembly.   

At the gate of the garden, two poor Persians were
standing. He told me to bring them in, and finding that
he did not have money, he borrowed two English pounds
from a believer, and gave one to each.   

###  5. Difference between ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Others 

In reference to a certain individual, he said, that the
difference between himself and many men is that he
wishes the welfare of the people for their own sakes, an
without any ulterior motive. He desires that every one
of the friends may shine like unto the sun. Others may
love you, but it may be for some purpose. They may
love you because they expect some day or some time,
to receive a reward from you; but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá expects
no reward. {{p193}} There are some people who are submerged
in mud, yet they believe that they are world-illuminating
suns. He wishes to free them from this water and clay,
clear their wings from these impediments, but they cry
out: “No, No, we are suns and stars; we are not in need
of thy education,” Notwithstanding this, he must open
the way for their freedom.   

###  6. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Three Roses 

Then he walked toward the end of the garden, and
spoke with the gardener. The latter picked three roses,
one white, one pink and one red, and offered them to the
Master, a beautiful symbol to those who know the meaning
and significance of each color. With these roses in
his hand, he faced the setting sun, — the horizon was
suffused with purple and crimson. For a long time he
looked toward the West, as though expecting to see the
sun rise from that direction. He was in deep thought.
Without a word he left the garden and we followed him.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 15, 1913. 

###  1. How Are You Today? 

How are you today? Are you happy? Are you glad
because you are living in this unparalleled cycle of the
Lord? Are you facing the world and its puzzling problems
this morning with courage and enthusiasm? Are
you going to make another heart happy beside your own?
Will you open wide the window of your soul? {{p194}} Is the
meadow of your life verdant? Will you continue to be
hopeful and optimistic? Will you dedicate yourself
anew to the service of your fellow men? Are you feeling
the whir and stir of the new dawn? What will you do
next to benefit mankind? What kind of thoughts and
ideals will you hold in the secret chambers of your minds?
Will they be exalted and lofty? Will they be humanitarian
and disinterested? Let us on this day make a new
resolution. Let us stand up and with a radiant faith proclaim
the Cause of God.   

###  2. Talk on Religion and Atheism by an Illiterate Bahá’í 

This morning our new pilgrim — Ḥájí Muḥammad
from Beirut — carried on a long discussion with me.   

“Religion and atheism; faith and agnosticism are like
two streams which have been flowing from unknown
sources since the genesis of mankind. The former is
sweet and the latter is bitter. When the stream of religion
becomes active, the stream of atheism is dried up;
therefore the fresh stream of faith must ever be strong
and aromatic, in order to consume the bitter stream of
unfaith which is tasteless. In this day Bahá’u’lláh from
the inaccessible heights of the mountains of revelation
has sent down upon the valley of humanity fresh and
sweeping torrents of Faith to swell the volume of the
stream of religion, and to irrigate the network of the
brooks of materialism. Each Bahá’í is a new torrent and
must roar with the power of reality. This stream of
truth is greater than an ocean. It clears the path from
all thorns and thistles and leaves behind it culture and
civilization.”   

To hear from the tongue of a simple man such a dissertation
was an extraordinary thing.   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Sends His Secretaries to Nouzha Park 

At 3 o’clock Ba<u>sh</u>ír told Mírzá Maḥmúd and me that
according to the wish of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi
would take us, this afternoon, to the famous Park of
Alexandria. {{p195}} I welcomed this invitation, because I had
been looking forward to the day when I could see this
public garden. We took the electric car for Alexandria
then another one through the city. The park has a fine
gate, and as one enters, one finds shady, inviting avenues
on every side. There are many animals, and a part of
our time was spent in watching them. The flower-beds
are laid out very artistically, there is a lake and many
small reservoirs of water in which gold fish disport themselves
with great abandon. Tall palm trees, at the top of
which many clusters of green dates are hanging, lend a
charming effect. It was about sunset when we left the
Park, having thoroughly enjoyed the scenic beauty and
large green vistas. We walked back half the way, and
then took the car.   

###  4. Attending a Bahá’í Meeting with New Pilgrims 

When we returned, the Master was talking to the
friends. He told us to go with the rest of the believers
to the weekly meeting in Ḥájí <u>Kh</u>urasání’s house. There
we saw three other pilgrims from Cairo, Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim, El Yahou and Mírzá Javád. {{p196}} Later on three
other Arab believers arrived to meet the Master, and so
the gathering was enlivened by the presence of these
newcomers. Tea was served, prayers were chanted, and
different ones spoke.   

###  5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Khedive of Egypt 

During our absence in the afternoon, Osman Pá<u>sh</u>á,
one of the Ministers of the Khedive, called on the Master
conveying the loving greetings of the Ruler of Egypt
and his longing to meet him. The date was then fixed
for the afternoon of August 17th. His Highness the
Khedive is now staying in Alexandria. His summer resort
is near Ramleh. He lives in one of his palaces
fronting the sea called Raas-ottin. The Khedive is
friendly to the Bahá’í Movement and has special regard
for the Master. It may be that history will record that
he is one of the few Oriental Rulers who has received
‘Abdu’l-Bahá with due honor.   

###  6. A Sweet Tablet to the Little Darling Mona 

While we were walking through the Garden of
Nouzha, the Beloved was dictating beautiful Tablets to
Mírzá Munír in another garden in Ramleh. One of
these Tablets is to the little daughter of Mrs. Theodora
de Bons whose husband is a dentist in Cairo. Now all
three are on a vacation in Switzerland. Her name is
Mona; so in this delightful manner the Master begins
the Tablet:   

O THOU MY DARLING LITTLE MONA! Thy tiny eloquent
letter was received and thy sweet dear thoughts
became known to me. {{p197}} Rest thou assured that I shall behold
thy charming, lovely face, and from thy dainty
mouth shall hear a wonderful melody and song in glorification,
thanksgiving and praise of the Almighty!   

“Upon thee be Bahá’u’l-Abhá.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 16, 1923. 

###  1. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Writes to a Hindu Bahá’í 

May I be permitted to start the day’s record with a
Tablet revealed to an Indian Bahá’í in Rangoon, who has
translated into the Hindustani language the holy books of
Íqán, Seven Valleys and Hidden Words? His name is
‘Abbás Ally Butt Cashmirce. Mr. Joseph Hannen, of Washington,
D. C., had forwarded a copy of a letter written
by him to the Master and the following is an answer
to it: —   

“He is God!   

O THOU ‘ABBÁS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ!   

O THOU NAMESAKE OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ!   

“The letter that thou didst write to Mr. Joseph Hannen
was forwarded by that beloved person to me. Couldst
thou realize what an ecstatic condition was obtained
through the reading of thy letter, unquestionably thou
wouldst become enkindled like unto a candle. Like unto
the moth thou wouldst burn thy wings and even as the
nightingale thou wouldst break forth into songs of
thanksgiving and glorification.   

“I love thee, and my heart and soul obtain the utmost
joy and fragrance when I remember thee. {{p198}} I hope that
thou wilt become assisted in rendering mighty service   

“It is my desire that thou wilt become confirmed and
aided in the diffusion of the Fragrance of God and in the
spreading of the Tablets and Holy words.   

“Convey to all the friends the wonderful, Abhá greetings”   

“Upon Thee be Bahá’u’l-Abhá!   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

###  2. El Yahou Arrives from Cairo 

One of the pilgrims — El Yahou, an old man — had
brought with him from Cairo a bouquet of fragrant white
flowers and six white fezes for the Master. He stayed
with us last night and kept our party in a good humor
until very late. In the morning he wanted the flowers
and fezes to be taken to the Master, which I did with
great pleasure. I knocked at the door, and the beloved
opened it. He took the bundle out of my hand and told
me that he would send for him in a few minutes.   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Dictates Tablets in the Garden 

In the afternoon after four o’clock the Beloved could
be seen in the garden of roses, preparing spiritual bouquets
to be forwarded to the Believers of the East and
the West. May these heavenly roses perfume the nostrils
of all mankind! May they scatter their aroma to all
parts of the globe! May they refine the atmosphere of
materialism and unbelief! May they dispel the clouds of
superstitions and doubts! May they adorn the chambers
and halls of the spirits and souls!   

###  4. Walks and Bahá’í Reminiscences 

Every night after dinner Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar and I take
a long walk as far as Sidi Jaber. {{p199}} Arriving there, we sit
in front of a Turkish Cafe facing the broad avenue.
round this cafe there are many palm trees. We watch
the long streams of carriages and automobiles driving
by from Ramleh to Alexandria, many of them carrying
shrouded Turkish and Arab ladies of the social world
going to theaters and places of amusement. Then we
drink coffee, lemonade or sherbet, all for the sum of five
cents. After half an hour’s rest we walk back, talking
now and then about America and the friends. These
lovely walks in the moonlit Egyptian night are most attractive.   

###  5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Gives Persian Names to Two German
and Austrian Bahá’ís Traveling in Persia 

A letter from Ma<u>sh</u>had stated that two European believers
have arrived in that city, a German and an Austrian.
The Master in answer wrote: —   

“Thou hast given the utmost praise to the two believers,
German and Austrian. Go to Stuttgart and see
with thine own eyes what is there! Those two blessed
souls who are living in your midst are the samples of
these other friends. Such persons have entered beneath
the Tent of Providence in Germany, each one of whom
sings like unto an ethereal Angel. Their hearts are attracted
by the Love of God and their spirits rejoiced by
the Glad-tidings of God! Exercise the utmost kindness
and love toward these two holy souls who are with you
Give the name of Ḥusayn to the German and Ḥasan to
the Austrian. In these names there is a wisdom. {{p200}} You
will become informed with their purport later.”   

###  6. The Believers must Summon the People to the
Kingdom 

In another Tablet he says:   

“All the believers of God and the maid-servants of the
Merciful must summon the people to the Kingdom and
be the cause of the guidance of the inhabitants of the
world. They must live and conduct themselves in such
a manner that in sanctity, prayerfulness and devotion they
may become distinguished from the rest of mankind.”   

###  7. Acquire Complete Concentration 

To the two French Bahá’ís who bade us farewell in
Marseilles, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: —   

“Praise be to God that you have not forgotten the time
of our meeting and that your hearts and souls are attracted
to Bahá’u’lláh. I hope that you will obtain complete
concentration of thought; so that you may have
no idea and conception save Bahá’u’lláh. Then you
shall make extraordinary progress, and the Confirmation
of the Kingdom of God shall descend upon you. You
shall develop a seeing eye and a heart overflowing with
the Love of God. Your breaths shall have influence
upon others and your tongues will become the interpreters
of the holy Books. Therefore, strive as much as you can
to attain to this station.”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 17, 1913. 

###  1. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Khedive of Egypt 

This was an important date in the Bahá’í calendar because
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the ruler of Egypt met each other
for the second or third time. Beyond this bare announcement
I have no other information. The Master may give
us, later, an account of the meeting, and thus in our imagination
we may construct a picture, or he may not
divulge any of the details. None of the believers were
with him. For the present it is enough to know that on
this day, between three and six p.m., the sovereign of
Egypt had the honor and privilege of talking with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
.   

###  2. A Traveling Companion for Mrs. Getsinger in Her
Approaching Visit to India 

I was given the utmost joy of standing in the presence
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá this morning. The more you receive his
benediction, the greater becomes your hunger.   

Mrs. Getsinger was called in and the question of a
traveling companion was discussed. Different names
were mentioned, but no one measured up to the requirements
of the Beloved. Then the name of Mrs. Isabel
Fraser was presented. “Yes, yes,” he exclaimed delightedly.
“She is just the right person.” He loves her very
much, and he always desires to assist her in serving the
Cause. Why did we not think of her sooner? She will
be able to render a great service in India. She has no
other thought except the Love of Bahá’u’lláh. {{p202}} Then he
dictated a cablegram to be sent to her without delay, the
contents of which are as follows:   

If possible leave immediately for Port Sa‘íd. Wish
send thee India for service. Cable Yazdí. ‘Abbás.”   

###  3. Story of the French Ambassador and the Turkish
Minister of Foreign Affairs about Christ’s
Resurrection 

Between 6 and 7 the Beloved came to our house and
stayed for more than an hour. He spoke of the enmity
of the ignorant people in every age and cycle for the
manifestations of God. This enmity comes through the
accumulation of dogmas and traditions and from blindly
following the religious leaders.   

Some people, he told us, are like unto the spiders. The
more you tear to pieces their cobwebs of imaginations and
imitations, the greater will become their zeal to spin again.
Once the French Ambassador at the Sublime Porte
satirically asked Fu’ad Pá<u>sh</u>á, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs: “How did Muḥammad ascend to heaven according
to your trustworthy tradition?” Fu’ad Pá<u>sh</u>á, realizing
the scoffing tone of the Ambassador, cheerfully
volunteered the answer by saying: “With the same ladder
that your Lord Christ ascended to heaven after his resurrection.”
His Excellency could not say anything. This
able answer seemed to silence him, and put him “hors de
combat.”   

Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá related several stories of the time of
Bahá’u’lláh when he was in Ba<u>gh</u>dád. These stories entirely
lose their beauty and charm if translated into English,
because they are in accord only with the Oriental
conception, and parts of them are masterful plays on
words and their various shades of meanings, which can
be enjoyed solely by the Persians. {{p203}} The Master knowing
so well their nature, from time to time, supplies the demand
and thus makes them more attracted to the Cause
by his peerless witticisms. He had just come from his
Interview with the Khedive, and as he was in such a delightful
humor, I believe the meeting must have been very
satisfactory.   

I concluded the day with the translation of Tablets to the
Persian believers:   

###  4. The Principle upon Which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Western
Trip Was Based 

Consider how ‘Abdu’l-Bahá forgot every material
thought and mention and turned his face toward the
countries and empires, cities and villages, mountains and
deserts of the West. Day and night he was engaged in
teaching the Cause and conveying the message The
principle upon which his trip was based was this:   

“O God, make all my ideals and thoughts One Ideal
and One Thought, and suffer me to attain to an eternal
unchangeable condition in Thy service!”   

He sought no rest, neither did he breathe one breath of
Comfort Notwithstanding the weakness of his constitution,
the infirmity of his body and the nervous fever, every
night, he was in a city and every day in a community.
Although at times he was hardly able to speak, yet he
delivered lengthy addresses. Working in this manner
shall bear fruits.   

###  5. America Cannot Be Compared to Europe 

In another Tablet, he says: 

“Praise be to God that this second journey is happily
completed, and that from the West I have returned to
the East. {{p204}} But this second voyage cannot be compared
with the first European trip, because America cannot be
compared with Europe. That country is another world;
its inhabitants are another people; their capacities are
receptivities of another type; therefore ‘Abdu’l-Bahá found
a vast arena, and an unlimited expanse and opportunity.
In all the conventions and conferences he raised the
clamor of ‘Ya Bahá’u’l-Abhá,’ and caused the clarion of
‘O My Lord the Clement’ to reach the Supreme Apex.
>From the infinite Bestowals of the Blessed Perfection I
am anticipating the appearance of the results of this trip.
I hope that this conduct of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will become an
example for the believers; so that all of them may convey
the message accordingly; be wanderers over deserts and
mountains; seeking no ease or composure and taking
their lives and spirits on the palms of their hands, and
sacrificing them to the Blessed Perfection.”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 18, 1913. 

###  1. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His Attitude toward Humanity 

The most significant Personality living in this age and
generation is the Personality of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Few souls
in the history of mankind have been so successful in
combining the harmonizing influence of the East and the
West. Day and night he wields the scepter of spiritual
powers. His gentle, loving Presence is felt in the remote
corners of the earth. His unerring judgment reads the
secret longings of the hearts. His knowledge spiritualizes
the lives of men. His love ennobles every being.
His sublime consciousness embraces each race and nation
of the earth. {{p205}} His universal conceptions enkindle the fire
of brotherhood; his divine mind grasps the plan of creation
and its ultimate fruition. In his dealings with the
people he is merciful. In his treatment of the poor he is
generous. In his association with men he is helpful. In
his intercourse with society he is democratic. In his
contact with his enemies he is forgiving. In his attitude
toward mankind he is a father. He loves all; He showers
his mercy upon all; He exercises kindness toward all.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the mystery of love but an open mystery.
God in his wisdom is daily revealing the secret of this
Love; so that we may learn more and more of its ineffable
sweetness and thoughtful tenderness. His life is a living
book of love in all its heights and depths; its ink has been
the blood of the martyrs, its chapters the tragic lives of
glorious souls; it is written with a pen made of precious
stones on the pages of universal history. Who can measure
the glorious possibilities of a life so complete as the
life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! He stands in the center of immensity.
He voices the mysteries of eternity; he upholds
the heavens of justice; he paves the path of the kingdom
of God; he ushers in the dawn of the new era; he breathes
a new spirit into dead bodies; he begems the firmament
of the Cause with the radiant stars of praiseworthy virtues;
he breaks the seals of the heavenly books; he fires
hearts with the Flame of the Love of God; he sings the
songs of the coming age; he calls all the inhabitants of
the globe to spiritual solidarity and he spreads far and
wide the Fragrance of the rose-garden of Abhá!   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and ‘Abdu’l-Hudá, a Favorite of the Sulṭán 

This morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to see us and stayed
a long time. He spoke about a great <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> who lived in
Constantinople and was a favorite of ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd. His
name was ‘Abdu’l-Hudá. {{p206}} He tried his utmost to intrigue
against the Master but failed to accomplish his purpose.
After the declaration of the Constitution in Turkey the
enemies of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> confiscated his property and reduced
him to wretched poverty. This sudden change in fortune
so deranged his mind that he died a year later. This
man had thought that Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd desired to
send for the Master to come to Constantinople to fill a
high position in the government, so he worked hard to
poison the mind of the Sulṭán against the Beloved. The
Master sent him a message to the effect, that he could
rest assured that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would not come to Constantinople,
even if he were sent for. He was a humble
servant of God. What connection between him and
royalty? He loved God and could worship Him better
in the solitude of his prison than amid royal splendor;
nay rather, the latter would separate him from the Threshold
of the Almighty.   

In the afternoon while passing by the door of the
House he called for Mírzá Munír to go to the garden
and take down the dictation of holy Tablets. In the
evening a number of the newly arrived pilgrims received
permission to see him.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 19, 1913. 

###  1. The Coming of Isabel Fraser to Egypt 

“Coming immediately, Fraser.” The words danced
before my eyes as the Beloved handed me the cable. {{p207}} In
my heart there was gladness, on my face a smile of contentment.
I looked up into the Countenance of the
Master, and saw that my elation was but a reflection of
his own satisfaction. Such a Bahá’í is priceless. Well
done good and faithful maid servant, you have made the
heart of the Beloved very happy! You have won the
ball of victory from the field of spiritual Glory! In the
presence of the Master you have received a new baptism
of fire and spirit. He will put in your hand the torch of
guidance; on your lips the words of light; in your heart
the symbol of life and he shall send you off with a new
power, a new dedication, a new vision. May the Hand
of God protect you throughout your voyage and bring
you safely into the land of Egypt wherein the ideal
Joseph lives! We are all gladness because you are coming
and look forward to the day when we will again talk
of holy and divine things as we were wont to do in London
and Edinburgh, Bristol and Paris. You will be a
welcome guest in the holy household. You shall have
much to write for the Bahá’í world.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Attends to His Mail 

I stayed only a few moments in the presence of the
Master this morning. He had sent for me to give me the
above news. I took to him a big package of Tablets with
their translations for the friends in America, and Europe.
He himself attends to the final dispatching of the rather
voluminous mail to all parts of the world. For the last
few days his health has been very good and his food, although
simple, is regularly served. He takes long walks
either at early morning or in the late afternoon, and at
such times he is always alone. {{p208}} Outwardly he is walking,
but in reality he is thinking and communing with our
Maker.   

###  3. Thou Must Be Firm and Unshakable in Thy Power 

In the afternoon I had again the good fortune of being
summoned into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s room. A cable has been
received from Doctor Getsinger saying that he was willing
to obey the call and to come. Mrs. Getsinger was
sent for and in the course of conversation the Beloved
told her that she must be firm and unshakable in her
purpose and never, never let any outward circumstances
worry her. He was sending her to India to bring about
certain definite results. She must enter that country with
a never-failing spirituality; a radiant faith, an eternal
enthusiasm, an inextinguishable fire, and a solid conviction — in order that she might achieve those services which
were required of her. Let not her heart be troubled. If
she goes away with this unchanging condition of invariability
of the inner state, she shall see the doors of confirmation
open before her face, her life will be a crown
of heavenly roses and she shall find herself in the highest
station of triumph. She should strive day and night to
attain to this exalted state! Let her look at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!
She does not know a thousandth part of the difficulties
and seemingly insurmountable obstacles which daily arise
before his eyes. He does not heed them. He is walking
in his chosen highway. He knows his destination. Hundreds
of storms and tempests may rage furiously about
his head, hundreds of Titanics may sink to the bottom
of the sea, mad waves may rise to the roofs of the
heavens: all these will not change his purpose, will not
disturb him in the least. He will not look either to the
left or to the right. He is looking ahead. Far, far, away,
piercing the impenetrable darkness of the night, past the
howling winds, and the raging storms, he sees the glorious
light beckoning to him. The balmy weather is coming,
and the voyager shall land safely. {{p209}} Kurrat-ul-ayne
had attained to this supreme state when they brought to
her the terrible news of the martyrdom of the Bahá’ís.
She did not waver; she also had chosen her path; she
knew her goal. And when they imparted to her the news
of her impending death, no one could see any trace of
sorrow in her face; rather she was happier. Although
she had never cared for dress, she wore on her supreme
day her best white silk robe and most precious jewels and
perfumed herself with the fragrant attar of rose. She
hailed the chamber of death as a happy bride entering
the nuptial bower of the bridegroom.   

Then, turning his face to Mrs. Getsinger, he ended his
talk by saying that she must attain to this lofty summit
of unchanging Purpose. Like Kurrat-ul-ayne nothing
must shake her firm faith.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His Talk with Miss Hiscock 

Miss Hiscock, who was with the Holy Family, was
called in. The Master told her that he was well pleased
with her. Her aim was to serve the Cause and the day
was coming when he should command her to teach. She
said:   

“I have no other hope save this Cause and the love of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”   

The Beloved answered that he knew, he knew.   

Afterward he told me that Miss Hiscock’s heart was
very pure. She was very sincere.   

Late in the afternoon he called on Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl
and stayed with him for nearly one hour. He passed by
our house but did not stay for tea. His spiritual figure
saluting us remained with me all night as a heavenly
picture of a divine being descended from on high.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 20, 1913. 

###  1. Strange Customs in Different Countries Are Not
Tokens of the Inferiority of the People 

Instead of giving you extracts from the daily talks of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, often I am obliged to substitute them with
extracts from Tablets, for only when I am called into
his presence, or when he comes to see us am I able to
give an account of what is passing. The rules of social
intercourse are so different from those in America that
we see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá much more seldom than when we
were traveling with him. We know well that no nation
can ever claim to be perfect, but that each one according
to its capacity and environment, has, and is contributing
something to the upbuilding of a universal civilization.   

###  2. On Divine Guidance from a Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

“O ye blessed souls! In the world of existence no
bounty remains eternal and permanent and no gift continues
to be immutable save the Bestowal of ‘Divine
Guidance’! This is the everlasting Grace! Praise be to
God that you have attained thereunto. Should you live
thousands of years and unloose thousands of tongues in
thanksgiving for this Grace, you would be unable to
render adequate praise; for praise is limited but this Grace
is unlimited. {{p211}} How many souls have longed to live in this
Day, yet their hope was unrealized and how many thousands
of people have undergone severe discipline, yet were
deprived of the Day of the Promised One.   

“Consider what a Bounty God has conferred upon you!
Without undergoing any hardships you have reached the
goal and without traversing vast Saharas you have drunk
from the ocean of sweet waters. Without any suffering
you have tasted of the fountain of guidance! This is the
great Bestowal if man can appreciate its value:
otherwise in the estimation of the ignorant, Guidance and
error are practically the same. A person who is not
thirsty is unaware of the delicacy of sweet waters, likewise
the salty ground does not absorb the outpourings of
the vernal showers and the withered tree is unresponsive
to the call of the rain from the cloud of spring.   

“Therefore thank ye God that you have received a
goodly portion and have become the confidents of the
mysteries of the Kingdom.”   

###  3. Lack of Trustworthiness 

In a Tablet he says:   

“Untrustworthiness is a poisonous arrow which mortally
wounds the heart, the soul and the spirit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”   

###  4. Persecutions in the Path of God 

In a Tablet he says:   

“Praise be to God that you are soaring in the Divine
rose-garden, have found your way to the Kingdom of
Mysteries and have become the recipients of the Favors
of His Highness the Incomparable One! {{p212}} On the other
hand you have endured the ridicule of the ill-wishers;
you have suffered sorely and have tasted the poison of the
tyrannical serpents, but as this was in the path of the
Glorious Lord, the venom became honey and the pain
health. Look at the outcome of such events. These
ordeals result in Divine Gifts. This blame and derision
will be followed by praise, glorification and adoration.
Ere long it will become evident and manifest.”   

###  5. Teaching the Cause 

In a Tablet on Teaching the Cause of God, he says:   

“Be thou in a state of utmost joy and fragrance and
render thanks unto the Forgiving Lord, that praise be to
God, thou art victorious and triumphant and art speaking
for the Glorification of His Highness the King of Mankind
and that in conveying the message thou art striving
and putting forth praiseworthy efforts. Know thou of a
certainty that the authoritative Firman is today revealed
from the Kingdom of Abhá for those who teach the
Cause. I hope that thou mayst become assisted in this
and be a means for the guidance of innumerable people!
This is the Divine Bestowal! This is the Eternal Honor!
This is the Everlasting Life!”   

###  6. Faithfulness at the Holy Threshold 

He writes:   

“I supplicate and entreat at the Threshold of the
Blessed Perfection and beg for the Divine Friends infinite
Bestowal and Grace: — so that they may become confirmed
in loyalty at the sanctified Threshold. {{p213}} May they
remember His Bounties and Favors sacrifice their
lives in His path and freely resign their possessions in the
Highway of the Merciful One.”   

###  7. Arrival of a New Pilgrim 

Today we welcomed another pilgrim from Tabriz
His name is Ḥájí ‘Abbás. He is a Turkish poet and does
not speak Persian very well. He is an old Bahá’í and has
served the Cause for many years. He will stay for nine
days. Generally all the pilgrims have permission to stay
nine days after which they return to their native land.   

We have heard from Haifa that Mrs. Stannard has
arrived there from Port Sa‘íd. In order to regain her
health she may spend the rest of the summer. The
Master was very anxious to know where and how she
is, and the other day he sent her a loving message of
inquiry through Miss Hiscock.   

###  8. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Photograph in Constantinople 

Our new pilgrim told us that while he was walking
through the streets of Constantinople he saw a photograph
of the Master surrounded by a group of Western
Bahá’ís, which was exhibited for sale in the window of a
photographer. In the picture the believers held aloft the
“Greatest Name” in their hands. Many people were
buying copies. This is very significant, considering that
In the same city lived the despot who imprisoned ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in the fortress of ‘Akká for more than forty years.   

###  9. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Talks on His Meeting and Conversation a Persian
General in Paris 

In the afternoon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walked in the garden and
two of the friends who had just arrived from Cairo went
there to see him. {{p214}} As I was returning from the Post
Office I passed by and observed him talking with much
animation. Immediately afterward I was called into his
presence.   

After supper while I was sitting in my room, writing,
the door opened and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came in I had neither
my Tarboush nor coat on and I jumped up from my seat
confusedly. He walked toward the veranda and asked:   

>  “Is there any one here?” 

It was a typical Oriental night, very quiet and enchanting
In a little while the friends gathered around him.
He asked questions about the believers of Cairo, and
Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim of <u>Sh</u>íráz answered them. In the
course of his talk ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that in this day the
greatness of the Bahá’í Cause is acknowledged by all
people, even by outsiders. A few months ago in Paris
one of the Sardars of Persia came to call on him. He
told ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the following story: When he was in
London he was invited by one of the English Peers to a
reception. There he met many members of the English
Nobility with their wives and daughters. He was introduced
to all and when they heard that he was a Persian,
many came forward expressing the utmost delight in
meeting a person who belonged to a race which had given
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the world. They asked him “Do you
know ‘Abdu’l-Bahá? Have you met him?” He noticed
that the wife of his host instead of wearing precious
stones on her fingers like the other women, wore a solitary
simple ring. He was a little surprised. He
approached her, saying: “What is this stone?” She answered:
“This is agate. Do you not know it?” He rejoined:
“Yes, but why do you wear it?” “Upon this
stone,” she answered proudly, “is impressed the name of
Bahá’u’lláh.” The Persian General was ignorant of the
teachings of this Cause, and could not understand the
significance of “Revelation.” {{p215}} He could not comprehend,
how a man communicates with God. These subjects were
beyond his mental capacity; neither should any one try
to teach him these things, because he had made up his
mind not to understand them. However, he knew, because
he had witnessed it with his own eyes, that this
Cause has become the means of the honor and glory of
Persia throughout the civilized world. To this he would
bear testimony to the end of his life!   

The teachings of the Blessed Perfection are so humanitarian,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued, that even the enemy
testifies that they are the spirit of this age. For example,
Bahá’u’lláh says: “O ye people of the world! Ye are the
fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch! Consort
with the followers of all religions with joy and fragrance.”
Throughout many cities of America and Europe, in
churches and meetings, he declared these Teachings with
a loud voice and there was not a single soul to contradict
them. Then he gave a detailed account of the meetings
in Washington, New York and San Francisco and
ended his talk by saying, that this Blessed Cause has such
great power that it shall, ere long, vanquish all opposition.
We must live and act in such manner as not to
lower the station of the Cause, but rather try by day
and by night to raise its banner higher. The Blessed
Perfection has given us wares which are eagerly sought
on the market place of the world.   

After a few moments of silence he departed, but left
us happy.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 21, 1913. 

###  1. The qualities of the members of the Spiritual Assembly. 

This morning Shoghi Effendi came and told me that
the Master was ready to receive me. {{p216}} Within a moment
I was standing in his presence. He inquired about my
health and asked how I was getting along with my fast.
Yet eleven days remain to the month of Ramaḍán, after
which the Muḥammadan world will hold a natural Fete.
Then he called in Lua Getsinger and inquired concerning
the Cause in America. A cablegram has been received
from Chicago about the re-election of the House of
Spirituality. He said that there was no need for re-election
at present. He told us that in the election of the
members of the House of Spirituality no political tactics
should enter. They must be free from self, nor anxious
to further their own personal ambitions. The existence
of the Spiritual Assembly is for no other purpose than to
discuss those means which call further the promotion of
the Cause; otherwise its non-existence is better than its
existence. The members must not be opinionated, but
must devote their attention to the services of the people.
The promotion of the principles of the Cause must be the
uppermost idea in their minds. Nothing else will yield
fruit. No secret canvassing will add to the luster of any
person. The people must be free and untrammeled to
choose whomsoever they want. As soon as political plans
are introduced in the Cause, the spirit is killed. The
apostles of Christ never devised any political schemes
whereby to win the majority vote. They went out into
the world and taught the gospel of light to all mankind.
The result is that whenever we mention the names of
John, or Peter or Matthew, a wonderful spirituality is
obtained, hearts are inspired and souls rejoiced. These
disciples were not politicians, they were the harbingers of
the Glad-tidings of the Kingdom. They did not know
anything about elections, votes, initiative and referendum.
They were filled with Christ. They knew Him only.
Similarly this Cause is pure Spirituality. It deals with
the moral aspect of humankind. {{p217}} The hearts of the believers
must be fountains of the Love of Bahá’u’lláh.
Freeing themselves from all withering restrictions, they
should occupy their time with the promulgation of the
word. They must love each other and banish all phantasms
of suspicion and doubt.   

Then he left the room and for a few moments I had
time to speak with Mrs. Getsinger. She is most happy
in her spiritual nest, and is learning to chant many prayers
of Bahá’u’lláh in the original.   

In the afternoon for nearly two hours ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
dictated Tablets to Mírzá Munír in the garden, and
when he passed by our house, he carried in his hand a
bouquet of yellow roses.   

In the evening some Arab friends called on him and
he entertained them until midnight. When they left he
was very tired, but well. How glad we are when he is
in good health.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 22, 1913. 

1 Story of the woodcutter and his wife. 2. Story of the
sinner and the Mullá. 3. Story of Baktashi and his
strange death amid the laughter of his friends. 4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
goes to the Mosque and gives money to the poor.   

###  1. Story of the Woodcutter and His Wife 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá told us three stories about Baktashis who
belong to a religious sect in Turkey. I am inclined to
report them as the Master has in each case been a direct
factor in them.   

When the Bahá’ís were staying in Adrianople there was
a Baktashi who lived close by them. Professionally
he was a wood-chopper, socially he was a wit. {{p218}} Once he
became severely ill and was on the eve of departure from
this world. Becoming acquainted with this fact, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
called on him. He was lying on a low, uncomfortable
cot, and his old wife was sitting beside it with
the marks of solicitude and care on her wrinkled face.
Suddenly she started to speak, addressing her husband:
“Thou art going to get well very soon. This sickness
shall pass away and thou wilt be strong. Oh, my beloved!
I am praying to Alláh for thy speedy recovery.
May Alláh hear my prayers!” The sick man, as though
pulling himself out of a heavy drowsiness, half-opened
his eyes and said: — “What can I do even if I get well?
I am tired of the world and want to leave it, my dear.
Oh! I am so weary, so weary.” And he closed his eyes.
The wife, with much agitation declared: “Oh no, no!
May Alláh never bring that black day! My darling!
Thou wilt gain back thy health. Together we will go
into the garden and there eat all kinds of fruits. Hand
in hand we will walk through the woods and listen to the
songs of the birds. Yes, yes, I will nurse thee back to
health, oh thou, the apple of my eye!” The sick man,
without opening his eyes, and seemingly with much struggle,
answered her back: — “Oh my wife, be silent!
Nothing shall happen if I get well, only this: I have to
chop ten or twenty or thirty more loads of wood. That’s
all. Have I not cut enough already? Oh, let me die!” In
this world we are all more or less wood-choppers. If
we are attacked by illness and survive it, we have to
work a little longer, chop a few more loads of wood, and
the world will go on as before.   

###  2. Story of the Sinner and the Mullá 

There was another Baktaski who, in his younger days,
was an officer in the Turkish government. {{p219}} This man became
very sick, and the members of his family had summoned
a Mullá to his bed. Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called
on him and they asked the Mullá to pray that God
might forgive his past sins before his death. After the
performance of many ceremonials, the Mullá, in his
most solemn voice, told the patient to repeat the formula: — “Oh, God! I have sinned much. Confer upon me
thy forgiveness.” The sick man did not answer. The
Mullá repeated the formula over and over, but to no
effect. Finally the patient, getting tired with this repetition,
turned his eyes to the Mullá and said with earnestness: — “Man! for many years I have sinned against God
and his servants. I have ransacked houses, orphaned
children, burned hearts and committed all kinds of iniquities.
Is the government of God so childlike as to forgive
all my past sins by the repetition of a mere formula? Is
God’s system of dispensing justice so loose? Be gone,
thou ignorant Mullá! Thou art telling me all these
things to get ten Piasters as thy fee. Come, come, my
friends, give him some money and let him depart quickly
from my presence. He is a Satan and a tempter!” Then
the Mullá left the room in haste, and when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was alone with him, the man fell on his knees, and
from the depths of his heart, cried out: “Oh Lord! Oh
Lord! I am a real sinner and thou art the just God!
beg Thy Mercy! I have committed many sins. I have
not done that which Thou hast commanded me and have
practiced those things which Thou hast made unlawful.
With humility and contrition I am standing in Thy Presence.
Do with me whatsoever Thou willest!” {{p220}} ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was much affected by this outpouring of sincerity
and departed, praying that his supplication might become
acceptable at the Threshold of the Almighty.   

###  3. Story of Baktashi and of His Strange Death amid the
Laughter of His Friends 

Facing the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Adrianople there
was a cafe. Here every day sat a retired officer of the
Turkish Army belonging to the Baktashi’s sect. The
Baktashis are always on good terms with the Bahá’ís.
They are a peaceful people. This retired soldier received
a pension of 5 Piasters (25 cents) a day from the government.
Every morning he would come and take a chair
in front of the cafe, and order a cup of coffee. Then the
people would gather around him and listen with delight
and laughter to his stories until noon. At that hour he
would call the waiter and give him five cents to buy him
two loaves of bread, two rolls of roast-meat and a dish of
salad. Then he would ask for a clean table and use
his neat handkerchief as a tablecloth. Every day he invited
one of the habitues of the cafe to lunch with him.
“Come here, my friend!” he would say placing a chair
on the other side of the table, and leaving before it a
loaf of bread, with one of the roast-meats. “Come and
be my guest today!” Then he would commence to eat.
Every mouthful that was taken was followed by the
short sentence “Oh God! I thank Thee! How delicious
is this lunch!” — till it was finished. Then again he would
start his conversation, always tempered with sharp wit
and the joy of living. From time to time he would come
to the Mosque of Sulṭán Sulaymán where the Governor
and the officers would gather about him to pass a pleasant
hour. He would keep them roaring with laughter over his
stories. One day, when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was also present,
the Baktashi entered with a mat under his arm. Laughingly
he saluted every one and said: — “Today I am
going to start on a long journey; therefore, I beg you to
forgive all my past shortcomings!” {{p221}} “Art thou going to
Ba<u>gh</u>dád?” one asked. “Further! much further!” “Surely
to China?” “Very much further.” Then no doubt
to Australia?” “Still further.” All this time everybody
laughed because they thought that he had a joke up his
sleeve. “Please, please,” he pleaded, “I beg you to forgive
me. Say that you do!” In order to humor him, they
said: “All right, we forgive thee!” Then he said: — “I am now happy. I will also forgive you, my good
friends!” Then he walked toward the court of the
Mosque; spread on the ground half of his mat, laid
himself down and covered his body with the other half.
The spectators, thinking that they had reached the climax
of the joke, laughed uproariously. Five minutes passed — no movement; ten, fifteen minutes, half an hour, no
sign of life. The time grew heavy and strained. They
looked at each other, with wonder in their eyes. Then
laughing and shrugging their shoulders, they left their
places and gathered around the mat. One of them, on
tip-toe, cautiously lifted one corner. Wonder of wonders!
The Baktashi had breathed his last. Then these
men carried him on their shoulders laughing and singing,
took him to the undertaker laughing, washed his
body laughing and buried him with roars and thunders
of laughter. It was a most phenomenal event! This
Baktashi used to call on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He had heard
about Bahá’u’lláh and knew something concerning the
Cause. The believers asked him several times to call
on the Blessed perfection, but he always refused, saying:
“How can I, the essence of sin, stand in the Presence
of the Essence of Holiness! I am not worthy of
this privilege. Whenever I find that I have deserved
such an honor, I will go; but not now, not now!” {{p222}} Thus
this good man lived and died in happiness.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Goes to the Mosque and Gives Money
to the Poor 

It was about noon when the Master passed by our
house and called for Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar to follow him.
When Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar returned he told us that as there
was a great festival at the Mosque of Sidi Jaber, the
Master had been invited to be present. The Mosque was
most beautifully decorated with flags and draperies. The
Khedive was there. After the ceremonies, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
came out and all the poor, men, women and children
gathered around him with their tattered garments and
dusty appearances. He placed money in their hands,
patting each on the shoulder and cheering everyone with
his loving glances.   

About four o’clock he went to the garden, but this
time all alone.   

Today I received letters from our American friends.
I read them with much pleasure, and their contents will
be presented to the Master at the first opportunity! May
this link of spiritual correspondence bring the East and
the West closer together!   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 23, 1913. 

###  1. The Bahá’ís Must Embody Their Teachings in Their
Lives 

The Bahá’í Movement has come into the world principally
as a Cause of Love, Spirituality, Unification, Reformation,
Reconciliation, Universal Peace, Idealism,
International Language, Unity of Religions, General
Education, Brotherhood and Celestial attributes which
will contribute toward the Union of the Orient and the
Occident. {{p223}} The inevitable conclusion is that those who
call themselves Bahá’ís must embody these principles in
their lives; so that mankind may discern with their own
eyes the concrete, spiritual results of the Bahá’í teachings
and arise to spread them more universally. We all desire
to see our ideals realized in a human being. If we admire
courage, we would like to see this quality in a hero. If we
love Love, we consider it a high privilege to behold this
attribute manifested in a person. In brief, we are hungering
for results.   

###  2. The Story of the Man Who Did Not Know the
Window in His Own Room 

The other day Mírzá Munír told us a story which
will illustrate this point. There was a young man in
Beirut who worked as a waiter in a restaurant. For
some time he had lived in a small room on the top of a
house. He worked all day and returned to his room at
night. One day he met an old friend of his on the street,
who had just arrived from his native town. “Where are
you going to live?” he inquired.   

“I am at this very moment looking for a hotel.”   

“Oh, no! Don’t go to a hotel. Come and be my
guest.”   

After some insistence the invitation was accepted.   

“Here is the key to my room. Take it. The address
is at such and such a place. Go there now and rest. I
will come after work, about nine o’clock.”   

The man took the key and found the place. {{p224}} As soon
as he had unlocked the door, a stuffy odor struck him.
He waited outside for a few minutes, and then with
much difficulty, entered. He found the room dark and
dirty and all the furniture covered with several layers
of dust. As he was accustomed to cleanliness, he began
to sweep the floor and to dust the objects. In carrying
the furniture and boxes from one corner to the other, he
uncovered the rusty shutters of a window, apparently
untouched for a long time. He opened it with much effort
and a flood of light poured into the room. Then,
he sat down and waited for his friend till night came,
then he went out and bought a candle. He lighted it
and began to read a book. Nine o’clock, and his friend
did not arrive; ten o’clock and there was no sign of him;
at eleven o’clock he got up from his seat and went out
to see what had become of him. He saw a man walking
to and fro on the veranda.   

“Who art thou?” he asked in the darkness.   

“I am ... and it seems that I have lost my room.”   

Realizing that this was his friend he told him that
this was his own house. The friend walked in and looked
about with evident astonishment:   

“I have lived in this room for a long time,” he said,
“and never knew that it had a window. I have never
lighted a candle. I enter the room by night and feel my
way to the bed. I take off my clothes and sleep. Before
sunrise, I dress and go out. Thus I have never been
here in the daytime. Now, when I came tonight, I
looked at the room and saw an open window; so I thought
that it surely was not mine, and for more than two hours
I have been pacing outside wondering what I should do.”   

Now God and His generosity has given us many
things but we have to find them; he has revealed many
precepts, but we have to live by them. If we close the
shutters of our hearts, the light will not come in, the
spiritual atmosphere will not become purified, dormant
powers will not be awakened, divine susceptibilities will
not be obtained; {{p225}} intellectual faculties will not become active;
heavenly illumination will not be realized; Celestial
Love will not be revealed; results will not be produced,
and moral civilization will not raise its standard.   

###  3. No Power On Earth Can Withstand the Cause
of God 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá passed by our house before noon and called
for Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar. He sent him to Alexandria to
attend to an errand and to personally call on an important
personage. Then he spent the afternoon in the garden
dictating Tablets for the Oriental Bahá’ís. About sunset
he came to us. Many believers were here, and he spoke
now in Arabic and again in Persian.   

He told us that the stories of the prophets recorded in
the Qur’án were not mere historical writings. They were
warnings to future generations after Muḥammad; so
that they might know how former people treated the
Messengers of God. Although they opposed the Cause
yet they were defeated in their purpose. Who can stand
before the Will of the Almighty? Let me give you an
example. His Holiness Christ, after his crucifixion, had
only eleven disciples. One of these had betrayed him;
another had denied him thrice, and the rest had deserted
him. On the crucial night of his life, he was left all
alone, friendless and helpless; yet in future years the
combined forces of the Roman and Greek emperors and
philosophers could not stamp out His Power. Like a
mighty torrent everything was swept before it. Now
after the departure of Bahá’u’lláh, at least five hundred
thousand men and women believed in Him; thousands
having already testified with their blood, and the rest,
ready at any moment to give up their lives. {{p226}} If we reflect
for one moment and compare the immediate results of the
two Movements, we will logically conclude that no power
on earth can stand in the path of the progress of the Bahá’í
Cause which is the Cause of humanity.   

Then he spoke of some of the incidents which had
occurred during the stirring days of ‘Akká, when, the Investigating
Committee at the instigation of his enemies
had arrived to send him to Feyzan. The events of those
years, 1906-7 if collected and written, would form one
of the most dramatic chapters in the Master’s epic life.
They illustrate more than anything else his divine courage,
endurance, patience and spiritual control over great
difficulties.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 24, 1913. 

###  1. How Tablets to the American Friends Are Spread
All Over Persia 

The other day I observed one of the pilgrims from a
faraway town of Persia holding a book in his hand. He
was reading it with great attention. Approaching him I
looked at the top of the page. To my surprise I read
the name of Mr. William Hoar of New York. {{p227}} It was
a copy of a Tablet revealed for him by the Master on
the eve of his departure from ‘Akká many years ago.   

“Do you know whose Tablet you are reading?” I
asked.   

“Of course I do. It belongs to one of our American
brothers,” he said with pride.   

“How did you come to get a copy of it?” I asked.   

“Oh! It is spread all over Persia,” he rejoined. “By
the way,” he said, as though remembering something,
“tell me about this Mr. Hoar. When I go away I would
like to tell the story to my friends, because we used to
read this Tablet at every meeting.”   

“Very well. Then ask the others to gather together
in the room and I will talk to you about him.” Having
told them all I knew about Mr. Hoar, and of what a
splendid and upright Bahá’í he was, I got a copy of the
Tablet, and I will share its contents with you; the original
is in eloquent Arabic.   

###  2. An Eloquent Tablet to Mr. William Hoar
of New York 

“TO MR. WILLIAM HOAR,   

“(Upon him be Bahá’u’lláh)   

“He is God!   

“O THOU VISITOR TO THE BLESSED TABERNACLE!   

“Verily the Messenger of Confirmation and the Commander
of Assistance invited thee and brought thee safely
to this radiant Holy Land. Verily thou hast crossed
the seas and passed through the cities until thou didst
reach to this Center of Lights, this Origin of divine
Traces and this Dawning-place of the inspiration of thy
Lord, the Mighty, the Master of Destiny! Verily, Verily,
I say unto thee, this is a Bestowal through whose mention
the Unitarians are rejoiced and for whose attainment
the sincere ones are longing. {{p228}} This is a food for
the spirit, a sustenance f rom heaven, a Grace through
which the hearts are resuscitated and a favor by which
the souls are re-vitalized. Render thou thanksgiving
unto the Lord for His Generosity and Liberality. Appreciate
thou its value and guard its preciousness.   

“I declare by the True One, that if a faithful believer
in God, while turning his face toward His Kingdom, the
Supreme, arrives at this White Land — the Luminous Spot — and perfumes his nostrils through the Fragrance of
Holiness, which is being diffused to all parts of the world, — the most dynamic Power shall aid him, the Glorious
Giver shall reinforce him with His Love and Good-pleasure
and confirm him in the accomplishment of a matter
which shall have no parallel in the realm of existence
and no similarity in the World of Visibility.   

“But as to thee, gird up the loins of endeavor and return
to that distant continent which is thy home and
give the Glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God to the
people, — the Kingdom whose doors are opened before the
faces of all that who live upon the earth and in
the heavens; a kingdom for the attainment of which the
chosen ones from amongst the dwellers of the cities of
the Almighty have longed, but have not attained. Verily
the capability for the receiving of this uninterrupted
Down-pouring, is a grace from the Graces of God and
a most glorious gift; and verily the Generosity of Thy
Lord is not limited.   

“Declare thou unto the people: Verily at this time
the Sun is shining, the orbs are gleaming, the stars are
sparkling, the lamps are ignited, the fire of the Love of
God is flaming high, the heavens are expanding, the seas
are becoming tempestuous, the breezes are wafting, the
Rain is pouring down; {{p229}} the earth is adorned, the Tabernacle
of the Lord is lifted up, the rose gardens are embellished,
the orchards are in luxuriant growth, the birds
are singing, the flowers are blossoming, while Fragrance
scatters and the zephyrs blow!   

“How long, how long will ye remain asleep in your
tombs, and rest upon the beds of negligence! Will ye not
awaken from your slumbers, cleanse your ears, respond
to the call of your Lord, the Omniscient and become the
objects of the Favor of your God, the Clement; reading
the verses of His Mercy and worshiping the Adored
Countenance in this Manifest Day? Hasten ye, Hasten
ye, O ye sincere ones! Hasten ye! Hasten ye, O ye attracted
ones! Hasten ye, Hasten ye! O ye expectant
ones! Hasten ye, Hasten ye, O ye longing ones! Ere
long ye shall behold the Banners of Guidance waving
from the summit of the highest mountains; the Knowledge
of God encircling this terrestrial globe and the signs
of the Bounties of your Lord manifesting in all directions
as the appearance of the sun in midday. On that
day the faithful ones shall break into songs of gladness,
the people of Unity shall rejoice and the hearts which are
filled with the Love of the Living, the Self-Subsistent
will become dilated, the heedless ones will be in loss, the
violators of the Covenant will regret and the rebellious
ones be in degradation.   

“O ye servants of God! Avail yourselves of the opportunity
which is offered to you through these Favors,
and do not ye forget that which was promised you in
all the holy writings. This day is the day of attraction!
This day is the day of enkindlement! This day is the
day of soaring toward the ethereal atmosphere of the
Merciful! This day is the day of the Call! This day
is the day of Grace! This day is the day of the Most
eminent Bestowal! This day is the day of the discovery
of the most valuable treasure! {{p230}} Oh ye servants of God!
Deprive not yourselves of the Ocean of Favor, and shut
not your eyes to the vision of the signs of your Lord,
the Omnipotent. Approach ye toward the Kingdom of
Abhá, the Supreme Heaven, the Loftiest station with
radiant faces, with hearts overflowing with the mention
of God and breasts dilated by the verses of God: — so
that you may attain to that which was longed for by the
righteous ones — the station coveted by the saints and
prayed for by the holy souls. Verily this is that which
causes astonishment to the people of intelligence.   

“Convey my greetings and praise to all the believers
of God in that vast and spacious continent and say unto
them from the tongues of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: — ‘O ye believers
of God! It is incumbent upon you to work mightily (in
the Cause), and to strive nobly to declare the Bounties
of God; be ye engaged in the Commemoration of the
name of God; be ye severed from all else save God; take
a firm hold of the rope of virtue, shun obedience to the
dictates of self and passion; practice kindness toward all
the people of the world; serve the Cause of Universal
Peace and show ye love to all the nations of the earth.’   

“Upon ye be greetings and praise!   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

###  3. The Minute Questions Asked of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

I did not see the Master this morning. Having received
large packages of letters from the various countries
of the East, he was busy reading them. Like simple
children they come to him for advice to solve their
problems.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Jokes and Beats His Secretary 

At four o’clock I found myself at the door of the
Master’s house. He was coming down with firm strides.
The carriage was waiting. {{p231}} He had promised to take Mr.
Atwood for a drive, and this was the day of fulfillment
In my hand I had a package of letters to be read to him
Looking at the rather thick package, he laughed and
taking it out of my hand, showed it to the upper windows
(apparently some of the members of the holy family
were looking down) saying:   

“Look what an amount of work Mírzá Aḥmad has
brought for me. Does he not deserve a sound beating?”
and with the umbrella’s handle he gently struck me twice
on my back. Then he entered the carriage, after him
Shoghi Effendi and next myself. Before reaching the
Hotel Plaisance to call for Mr. Atwood, he talked with
much humor, laughing all the time.   

###  5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Says That If People Wish to Sneeze
They Ask Him about It 

On the way he told us that matters had reached such a
point that if the friends wanted to cough or sneeze they
wrote to him to do it for them. He has repeatedly written
that any realizable plan which has for its aim the
spread of the Cause is acceptable. Each one wishes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
to free him from his perplexities and to lighten his
work; but no one yet has asked to come and be of service
to him; and help to lighten his load.   

###  6. A Talk by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Creation 

Finally we reached the hotel, picked up Mr. Atwood
and started again. Mr. Atwood has written two articles
on the Bahá’í Cause. The first has appeared in the Christian
Commonwealth, the second will be published in another
English paper. {{p232}} On the way he asked two questions,
one on creation and its apparent incongruities and anomalies;
the other on free will and determination. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
answered as follows: If we look upon creation
from a remote outlook, we see symmetry and harmony;
the apparent differences and anomalies blending into
one harmonious whole; but if we study the world of
genesis from a partial standpoint, these freaks of nature
come to our notice at every turn. All parts, kinds and
species of the creational life are interrelated. There is
an invisible chain binding all into one mass of homogeneity.
Those anomalies of creation which we call
freaks are not freaks at all; but are made by a definite
wisdom. As soon as we learn the purpose of their creation,
they are no longer freaks, but parts of a whole.
For example, we know the wisdom of the existence of the
eyes, the ears, the teeth, the hands and the feet, but we
may wonder why a single hair is grown on the top of
somebody’s nose. This also has a purpose were we to become
cognizant of it. The law of composition and decomposition,
amalgamation and dissolution, construction
and destruction, protection and danger are two basic
principles of creation. An organism — whether living or
inanimate — must be decomposed at a stated time; so that
through its scattered atoms, elements of other organisms
may be composed and created. Creation therefore, is
based upon the activities of these two fundamental laws.
On the other hand, there is the law of the eater and of the
eaten. The higher forms of life feed upon the lower
species of genesis. The grass takes its nourishment from
the soil, and every day grows taller and taller like unto
this (extending his hand toward the tall grass waving
in the field). The animal in turn (showing a cow grazing
in the field) eats the grass and is sustained by it.
After a while man appears, kills the cow and eats it.
Thus we observe that the various kingdoms of Life feed
upon each other; but they have no conscious knowledge
of the other’s existence. {{p233}} Hence the inferior degree is
entirely out of touch with the superior degree, but the
upper can look down upon the lower and help it. Therefore,
while we are living in this world, we are not informed
of the existence of the Spiritual world, but the
dwellers of the spiritual world know about us and can
assist and help us.   

###  7. Explanation of Free Will 

As regards free will. There are two distinct kinds of
affairs, the first dominated by man, the second which is
beyond his control; the first voluntary, the second involuntary.
I am a free man so far as walking is concerned,
but I am not free to soar in the air, unless I build
an aeroplane.   

###  8. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Talks to <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s and Young Egyptians
of His Trip to the West 

While the carriage was rolling on past fields of cotton,
palm groves, and primitive hamlets, the Master continued
speaking on the above two subjects. We returned about
7 o’clock. Mr. Atwood enjoyed the ride and thanked
him for it. At 8:30 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to our house
There were some Arab <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s waiting. After indulging
in some poetry and philosophic jargons to which the
Master listened patiently, one of them ended by the announcement
that his wife and children were sick and he
had no money. The Master gave him five Majídis (5
dollars) and he left the house happy. Afterwards six
young Egyptian nobles arrived. {{p234}} For more than two
hours ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke to them about the virtues of
the English and American people, of their scientific
achievement, and of his travels throughout those distant
countries, so full of wonders. Then he gave a resume
of his lecture in the Jewish Synagogues of America. He
was very lively in his descriptions and laughed throughout
this interesting talk. The young Egyptians were all
attention.   

Today the Master was very happy and well. And his
words created joy and spread sunshine. When he
laughed the waves of his mirth rippled over the sea of
our lives; creating wider and wider circles of the joy
of living.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 25, 1913. 

###  1. International Bahá’í Correspondence Conducive to
Unity 

Most important of all is the establishment of a line of
correspondence between the East and the West. Not
that it may go on for a year or two only, but that it may
continue without interruption. The success of every affair
depends upon one’s firmness in following it up. Of
no less importance is correspondence between the various
Bahá’í Assemblies; for each assembly thus becomes informed
of the status of the other, and gives its moral
support. It would be well to designate certain active
centers in America — Chicago, Washington, New York,
San Francisco, Boston, etc., — to correspond regularly
with European and Oriental Assemblies and in turn disseminate
the news they receive to smaller centers; {{p235}} that
the future Bahá’í conventions may give one or more sessions
to the consideration of this important subject; that
the secretaries may report on what they have done during
the year and how many letters they have written and
received.   

As a confirmation to the foregoing statement, I translate
the following Tablet, and am sure, that after reading
it, the Bahá’ís will do their utmost to carry out its contents: —   

“The correspondence of the believers of God with all
parts of America and from America to all directions is
very acceptable and seasonable. It will be the means of
drawing hearts together. Display the utmost effort in
this matter. The friends of God must be like bouquets
of roses, disseminating their sweet fragrances one to another.
They should assist each other: — so that, through
the powers of the Kingdom, cooperation and reciprocity
may be obtained. Correspondence and communication
are the two greatest means for solidarity.   

“It is said that correspondence is equal to half-meeting.   

“Forward a copy of this Tablet to all parts, — so that
the friends of God in every city may correspond in a
representative way, with other cities; especially with
America. This will be the cause of enkindlement and the
means of attraction. The souls will become exhilarated,
the spirits gladdened, the hearts stirred into cheerfulness,
and the breasts dilated.”   

###  2. The Weather in Ramleh 

The days and nights of Ramleh are without rain. In
the shade it is always cool. The sky is as blue as the
bluest turquoise. At night the heavens are illumined
with radiant stars. {{p236}} During the winter there is no snow,
and the weather is balmy.   

###  3. Receipt of Bahá’í Reports from America 

Today, at about half past three, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, passing
by the house, called out my name, and in a second, I was
following after him. He told me to bring the letters
with me. I was glad for this. Reaching the gate of the
garden, I knocked at the door, and the gardener opened
it. The Master entered, took off his black coat and yellow
“Abá,” and placed them on the branch of a fig tree.
He was now all in white. For a few minutes he walked
along the avenues and I could see his wonderful stature
through the branches stirred by the wafting of the breeze.   

He told me that when the weather was good his constitution
responded to it and that he felt like a different
person.   

Then he started to dictate Tablets.   

The third monthly report of Mr. Joseph H. Hannen,
from Washington, D.C., was read. As he listened, his
face brightened, and recalling different names mentioned
in the letter, he exclaimed “Bravo Mrs. Belmont,”
“Bravo So and So.” He directed me to send copies of
this report to Cairo and Ṭihrán; — so that they might
spread it to other Bahá’í Centers, and to keep the original
for him. In the evening he told the believers that a good
report had been received from Washington which made
him very happy. They should read it.   

###  4. The Story of Fu’ad Pá<u>sh</u>á, the Grand Vizír of
Turkey 

After two hours of dictation he left the garden to see
a house which he desired to rent for the coming pilgrims
from India and Persia. On the way we met the son of
the former Consul of Damascus, Há<u>sh</u>im <u>Kh</u>án, with
the Secretary of the Consulate of Alexandria. {{p237}} They had
come to pay their respects to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. After seeing
the house, the Master took his guests to the apartment
of Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl, and there, on the veranda, he conversed
with them. As the son of the Consul — a pleasant,
polite young man — had just arrived from Constantinople,
the conversation naturally turned in the direction of the
late war and its dreadful consequences.   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that the thoughts of the statesmen of
the East are atrophied, and their hearts devoid of desire
for the progress of the nation. Their ideas are petty,
not sublime; selfish, not disinterested; local, not general.
They think more of the advancement of their own interests,
than of those of the country. They are not far-seeing
patriots, but inexperienced tyros. They sell the
resources of their country, if they think that by so doing
they can fill their own pockets. Except in two instances,
the Muḥammadan countries of the East have not produced
any real statesmen for the last 200 years. When
he was in Constantinople he heard on every side the
praise of Fu’ad Pá<u>sh</u>á, the then Grand Vizír. At that
time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was about seventeen or eighteen years
old. One day he was in the house of Kamál Pá<u>sh</u>á, the
former Ambassador of Turkey to Persia. The latter
spoke Persian fluently, and as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had known him
when he was an official in Ṭihrán, he called on him
during his short stay in Constantinople, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
returned the visit. While they were engaged in conversation,
Fu’ad Pá<u>sh</u>á was announced. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá thought
to himself: “Now I shall have the opportunity of meeting
this celebrated statesman, and of hearing words of
political wisdom from his lips.” As soon as Fu’ad Pá<u>sh</u>á
entered, his first word was addressed to Kamál Pá<u>sh</u>á.
“I could not sleep last night.” {{p238}} A statesman who can
not sleep all night must of necessity be thinking out the
vast plan of some administrative reform, or public or
civic welfare. “I did not enjoy one wink of slumber
till this morning: the result being the composition of
two blank verses,” he said. “Do you want me to read
them to you?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was astonished at this state
of affairs, that the Grand Minister of an Empire does
not sleep all night for the writing of two blank verses.
The lines were some poetical exaggeration about the
beauty and tresses of his Beloved. When he left the room
‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked Kamál Pá<u>sh</u>á: “Why did you praise
so volubly those vapid verses ?” He said: — “Why, we
can’t do otherwise.”   

###  5. Gaem-magam — the Persian Statesman 

Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told us another story about this man.
He had ordered the killing of several hundred persons,
exiled two or three thousand innocent men, and paid
a large indemnity of eight millions to one of the European
powers, to satisfy their demands based upon certain occurrences
which had transpired in Syria. But in Persia,
during the Ministry of the Great Gaem-magam, the Legation
of one of the Foreign Nations was burned down and
seventy-two people were killed by the populace, yet
that far-sighted and astute Persian Minister so dexterously
satisfied that foreign Power without paying an
indemnity or killing or banishing anyone, that this one
act alone became the greatest political feat of that Persian
statesman, Gaem-magam.   

###  6. The Story of the Sick Soldier and the Watchman 

While ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in Adrianople, <u>Kh</u>ur<u>sh</u>íd
Pá<u>sh</u>á, the Valí, one day asked him about the future of
the Turkish Empire.   

“Do you want me to give you my frank opinion?”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said.   

“Yes, of course,” he answered.   

“Then, let me illustrate your position by a story. {{p239}} During
the war against a foreign nation, one of the soldiers
was stricken with a severe sickness. The military doctor,
observing his case, recommended him to the watchman,
saying: “This man must not sleep tonight. It is
the crisis of his illness, but tomorrow morning he will
feel much better. Nurse him very carefully and watch
over him.” The doctor left, and about sunset the watchman
came around to look after the sick man. After an
hour or two he saw that he was getting worse, and was
moaning and lamenting loudly. In order to alleviate
his pain, the watchman gave him an opium pill, as a result
of which he slept soundly all night. In the morning,
the doctor called and saw that the condition of the patient
was worse than the day before. Not being able to understand
this relapse, he sent for the watchman. “What
did you do for him last night?” “Oh, he was in such a
frantic condition that I gave him a pill of opium, after
which he slept soundly.” “Did you not think that I, who
am a doctor, knew this remedy just a well as you, but I
did not give it to him because I knew that it would make
him worse?” “What do I care? I wanted to sleep and
this patient disturbed me. I gave him an opium pill,
and it served its purpose. To-night there will be another
watchman. If the patient is getting worse, it does not
trouble me in the least.”   

“Now”, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told the Governor, “it is your watch-time.
You are not doing anything to improve the condition
of the sick country. You are putting it to sleep
by giving it narcotics, and when you leave your position,
what do you care whether the patient will live or die?
You have had your night’s sleep. {{p240}} Instead of watching
the patient solicitously, and pulling him through, you
prefer your own rest and comfort.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 26, 1913. 

###  1. The Bahá’ís Must Raise a New Voice 

Last night Ḥájí Muḥammad, the brother of Aḥmad
Yazdí, arrived from Port Sa‘íd, and brought us our mail.
I had a few letters from America, the contents of which
gave much pleasure to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The breeze of good
news must ever waft from the direction of the West to
gladden the heart of the Center of the Covenant. May
the believers of God, during the coming years plant new
seeds in the gardens of hearts, educate new souls in the
divine school, adorn with new stars the heaven of Reality,
upraise new banners in the army of the Kingdom,
cultivate new flowers in the Paradise of Abhá, issue a
new voice through the pillars of the earth, herald the new
message with a new enthusiasm, break through the rank
and file of indifference with a new impetuosity, invite
new guests to sit around the heavenly table, ask new
thirsty ones to drink from the spring of life, create a new
motion in the spiritual spheres, throw a new stir in the
world of ideals, and pave new highways leading to the
Supreme Concourse.   

In the morning I went to Alexandria, and having dispatched
some letters and attended to duties entrusted to
me by the Master, returned. {{p241}} All day our house was an
interesting center for the coming and going of the believers
and pilgrims. Ḥájí ‘Abbás, received permission
to return to his home via Constantinople and Russia.   

###  2. The Article of Arthur Brisbane on Science, Translated
and Published in Arabic Daily and Discussed
by Students 

In the afternoon I called at the apartment of Mírzá
Abu’l-Faḍl. There were several young Arab Bahá’ís present,
and to my pleasant surprise, the subject of discussion
was an article by Arthur Brisbane, feature writer of Mr.
Hearst’s papers in the United States. The article dealt
with the wonders of science and the discoveries of this
age. It was translated into Arabic by an Egyptian daily
and published in the current issue. Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl
could not agree with certain statements made by Arthur
Brisbane. After much discussion pro and con, he directed
Ḥusayn Rúḥí to write an answer and to forward it to
the Editor of the paper. {{p242}} As I sat there, I thought how
small the world was! What would Arthur Brisbane say
or think did he know that his article, written thousands
of miles away, in a new world, surrounded by a complex
civilization, was being discussed and criticized by
a number of Arabian students, supervised by a Persian
philosopher, in a summer resort of Ancient Egypt.
Truly the world is becoming one!   

I may conclude with extracts from some Tablets which
I have gathered out of the manuscript book of one of the
pilgrims. They reflect the Bahá’í qualities and spirit.   

###  3. This World Is Dark, It Must Be Changed into a
Universe of Light 

“O ye friends of God and assistants of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!   

“What can I write, and what can I say? That which
is in the heart can be neither translated into words nor
written on paper, and that which can be moulded into
phrases cannot express the susceptibilities of the heart
and conscience; therefore, I address you, O ye real
friends: — Turn the mirrors of your hearts toward mine.
Unquestionably the mysteries of this heart shall become
reflected upon yours, and the emotions of this longing
one will become evident and manifest in all regions.   

“The world is black; the Divine Bestowal is Radiant.
This blackness must be changed into light, and this narrow,
dark sphere be transformed into a vast, illimitable
universe of illumination. The body of the world is a
dead corpse, it must be resuscitated; it is withered. it
must be made fresh and blooming; it is extinct, it must
be enkindled; it is the arena for the expression of animosity,
it must be made the dawning-place of love and good
fellowship; it is the origin of the emanation of contention,
we must make it the axis around which revolves
unity; it is the exposition for the baser qualities which
lead to eternal disgrace, we must make it the rising-point
for the refulgent rays of the Everlasting Glory. The
stranger must be instructed in the lesson of neighborliness;
the heedless ones be made aware; the enemies
must be loved and the hateful ones be shown kindness.
We must become flaming torches and burning Fires of
God. We must move the world, and illuminate the dark
globe. {{p243}} All this depends upon the effort of the friends
and the sacrifice of the beloved ones.”   

###  4. Attraction Is Not Realized Save through Teaching
the Cause of God 

“O thou servant of the Almighty! Beg of God that in
this world which is groaning with pains and troubles,
thou mayst aspire to a breath of rest and that in this
sorrow-begirdled globe, thou mayst obtain happiness.
This Bestowal will not become unveiled and this Grace
will not adorn the Assemblage of the heart except through
severance from all else save God and by complete concentration
upon the kingdom of Abhá. This severance
and attention will not be obtained save by attraction to
the Fragrances of God, and by enkindlement with the
Fire of the Love of God. This attraction and enkindlement
will not be realized except through teaching the
Cause of God and by firmness and steadfastness in the
Covenant and Testament of God. Upon thee be Abhá,
and upon every one who is severed, attentive, attracted
and enkindled; conveying the message while he is firm
and steadfast....”   

###  5. Confer upon Every One Spiritual Joy 

“O thou who art exhilarated with the Cup of the
True One:   

“Thou hast the desire to render a great service at the
Threshold of the Almighty. Happy art thou that thou
art confirmed with this bounteous aim. Today, ecstasy
and yearning at the Threshold of God, enkindlement
with the Fire of the Love of God, attraction with the
Fragrance of God and the Song and melody of the Supreme
Concourse, are true service. Be thou an ignited
torch and cast upon all people the reflection of its rays
Enkindle the Fire of Love and burn away all veils
Confer upon every one spiritual joy and gladness and
manifest a merciful nature and disposition. {{p244}} Deliver men
from prison and lead them to the Court of Guidance.”   

###  6. A Poetic Tablet, Like a Bouquet of Fragrant
Flowers 

“O ye who are intoxicated with the Wine of God!   

“The Breeze of the Merciful is wafting from the
rose-garden of Eternity, the luminous Morn hath dawned
from the horizon of significances; the clarion Call reaches
to the ears from the Kingdom of Abhá; the melody of
the wisdom of the nightingale of the meadow of sanctity
is raised; the Paradise of unity and the orchard of Abstraction
are opened and luxuriant; the roses of idealism,
and the flowers of the merciful verities are laughing
and blooming; the hyacinths and anemones are fresh
and full of fragrance; the trees of the divine Garden are
fruitful, their roots firm in the ground; the rivers of life
are flowing; the fountain of unending Grace is gushing
forth, leaping playfully on and on; the liberty-loving
Cypress has raised its branches toward the sky; the
longing dove is cooing; the real Leila with a rosy-cheeked
Countenance is manifest; the Manjun of Consciousness
with burning heart is evident.”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 27, 1913. 

###  1. This Is the Seed-sowing Time 

Teaching the word of God — spreading the Glad-tidings
of the Kingdom — conveying the Message of
Unity and raising the Flag of International Peace hold
the foremost ground in the Bahá’í Cause. {{p244}} When we
receive certain heavenly privileges and spiritual distinctions,
we must share them with the rest of our fellow
men. The very fact that we have received, connotes the,
idea of giving. By-teaching, our own knowledge will be
increased. When the water is not constantly flowing, it ‘
will stagnate, no matter how crystalline and pure. If you
have a handful of seeds, you must sew them during the
season, so that you may gather a goodly crop at the harvest.
Now this is the seed-sowing time of the Kingdom
of Brotherhood. This and this alone will yield fruit.
We must, like wise farmers, get up early in the morning,
and go about our business with no other thought in our
minds except sowing the seeds. We must sow all the
seeds that God has given us, and if we have scattered
all our stock, he stands ready to replenish it from his invisible
storehouse. Once the seeds are sown; the sun
of Providence will shine forth, the Breeze of Mercy
will waft, the rain of clemency will pour down, causing
the growing of the field, waving with a soft, beautiful
verdancy and soon attaining to the stage of fruition — the sheaves laden with golden corns. Then is the time of
rejoicing for the farmer, because the result of his labor
and industry is spread before his eyes.   

###  2. This Is the Day in Which to Lay the Foundations
of the House 

Before everything else we must lay the foundation.
Then go out and gather mortar, stones, bricks, lime,
hauling machinery and laborers to build the house. What
benefit will accrue to us if we buy the furniture or utensils
before the house is ready? How can we build the
roof before the structural framework is put together?
A wise builder lays a good basis for his house, collects
all the necessary material, and then goes on, step by step,
in its construction. {{p246}} ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has shown through his
life, and deeds how this is the most important work of
the Cause. The autumn and winter seasons will come
in due time. Our supreme duty now is to arise unanimously
for the awakening of souls! Should we follow
the example of the Divine Farmer, we will reap a great
crop in the harvest season, we will see the reflections of
our contented faces in the mirror of the Kingdom, and
will observe our names inscribed upon the scroll of time
with the pen of light. The friends all over the world
are longing to serve the Cause. Praise be to God that
their aims are humanitarian, their ideas are lofty, their
love for the Truth manifest, their eagerness to diffuse
the lights of the Sun of Reality evident and their spiritual
susceptibilities warm and aglowing. They are servants
of the world of humanity, and heralds of the Kingdom
of Light. May they become confirmed to teach the Cause
with a new fervor and inspiration!   

In a Tablet written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá several years ago,
he says:   

###  3. Our Efforts Must Be Centralized About the
Spreading of the Cause 

“The believers with the utmost steadfastness and firmness
must engage in the teaching of the Cause. They
must become united and agreed. They are all the drops
of one river, waves of one sea, breezes of one garden,
streams flowing from one fountain, birds soaring toward
one apex, hyacinths adorning one Park, intoxicated with
one wine and their hearts ravished with one melody....
It is hoped that the friends may become sanctified and
holy above all earthly conditions and in concord and
harmony, in unity of identity, unity of quality, unity
of opinion and unity of thought, set an example for all
the believers of other countries and become the spiritual
leaders in this arena. {{p247}} Now all aims must verge toward
one spring, and all efforts be centralized in one object,
and that is: the diffusion of the Fragrances of the Merciful,
and the promulgation of the Word of the Almighty.
The time of systematization and crystallization shall
come. It has not yet arrived. The aim of all the friends
must be this: — the diffusion of the Fragrances of Holiness.
When a man’s efforts are concentrated on this one
object, he will undoubtedly reflect the confirmation of the
Manifest Light. Except for the guidance of souls, no
other cause is equally confirmed. If any person entertains
other thoughts than this, he will unquestionably
regret them.   

“During the season of seed-sowing you cannot gather
a crop and at the time of irrigation, harvesting is unthinkable.
The soul who, during the summer season,
engages in planting trees, will not reap any reward, for
that is the season of fruit-gathering, and not that of
tree-planting. In short, the purpose is this: During the
season of the Divine Spring we must occupy all our time
in seed-sowing and irrigation, and not in harvesting and
crop-collecting.”   

This morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called on Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl,
and spoke with him for half an hour on the importance
of teaching the Cause in this day, and of the subserviency
of all other ideas to the idea of promoting the word of
God. In the evening he entertained a Russian Prince
and a number of Arab <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s at his home.   

###  4. Hope for the Reunion of the East and the West 

Letters and cablegrams are pouring in from all parts of
the world. {{p248}} The Master is daily growing stronger, and
is attending to all the innumerable duties which are laid
on his shoulders.

###  1. The Life of the East and the West and of How the
Bahá’í Movement Unites Them 

The spiritual life of the East is calm and uplifting. It
has a celestial outlook. It purifies one’s aims. It ennobles
the character. It changes the satan into the angel.
There is a subtle influence in this life which works like
magic over the hearts of men. It steadies the nerves,
confers an equipoise, intensifies spiritual feelings and bestows
mental calmness and serenity. The realization of
the power of faith and prayer dawns upon the mind; the
divine Presence is felt as never before and the holy light
breaks upon the dark chambers of the heart. Those who
have lived in the East and have experienced this feeling
cannot describe it in words. It is a fire the flame of
which sets aglow many hearts, and which inspires the
imagination with pictures of heavenly attributes.   

While the life of the East on the one hand is sweetly
contemplative, the life of the West is energetically active;
the former is a calm river, the latter a rushing cyclone.
One interprets life subjectively, the other elucidates it
objectively. The Bahá’í Movement establishes a balance
between the two poles. The materialism of the occident
is imbued with spirit and the unproductive mysticism of
the Orient is discountenanced when work is constituted
as worship. {{p249}} Thus the Bahá’í Cause is in a position to
help both hemispheres with its new spiritual philosophy.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is daily working for the consummation of
this object.   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Writes on the Future Condition of
Women 

This morning we got glimpses of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as he
passed by our house two or three times. He was busy
all day. In the evening, the correspondent of the Agdam,
published in Cairo, called on him and had a long interview.
These days, the Master is devoting much of his
time to writing Tablets for the Persian believers. He
is fulfilling his promise, that after his return from
America and Europe, he would answer all their petitions.
I produce herein the translation of one of these
Tablets on the “Feminist Question,” — one that is very
opportune. It is as follows:   

“O thou my beloved daughter! Thy eloquent and
fluent letter was perused in a garden, under the cool shade
of a tree, while the gentle breeze was wafting. The
means of physical enjoyment was spread before the eyes
and thy letter became the cause of spiritual enjoyment.
Truly, I say, it was not a letter, but a rose-garden
adorned with hyacinths and flowers. It contained the
sweet Fragrances of Paradise and the Zephyr of Divine
Love blew from its roseate words.   

“As I have not ample time at my disposal, I will give
herein a brief answer. It is as follows: — In the revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh, men and women stand shoulder to
shoulder. In no instance will the women be left behind.
Their rights with men are in equal degree. They will
enter into all the administrative branches of the body
politic. They will attain to such a high plane that they
will be honored in the very highest station of the world
of humanity and will take part in all affairs. {{p250}} Rest ye
assured of this! Do not look upon present conditions; in
the not distant future the world of women will become
all-refulgent and all-glorious. For His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh
hath willed it so. At the time of elections the right
to vote is the inalienable prerogative of women, and their
admittance to all the departments of life an irrefutable
and incontestable right. No soul can retard or prevent
it. But there are certain matters, participation in which,
is not worthy of woman. For example, at the time when
the community is taking up vigorous defensive measures
against the attack of foes, the women are exempt from
military engagements. It may so happen that at a given
time, warlike and savage tribes may furiously attack the
body politic with the intention of carrying on a wholesale
slaughter of its members; under such circumstances defense
is necessary; and it is the duty of the men and not
of the women to organize and execute such defensive
measures, because the women’s hearts are tender, and cannot
endure the sight of horror and carnage, even if it is
for the sake of defense. For such, and similar undertakings,
the women are exempt.   

“As regards the Constitution of the House of Justice,
Bahá’u’lláh, in the Book of Aqdas, addressed the men,
saying: — ‘O ye men of the House of Justice!’ but (when
the members are being elected) the right which belongs
to women, so far as their voting and their voice is concerned,
is indisputable. When women attain to the ultimate
degree of progress, then, according to the exigencies
of time and place, and of their capacity, they shall obtain
extraordinary privileges. Be ye confident on this account. His
Holiness Bahá’u’lláh has greatly strengthened
the Cause of women and their rights and privileges are
the special principles of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. {{p251}} Rest ye assured!
Ere long the day will come when the men, addressing
the women will say: — Blessed are ye! Blessed are ye!
Verily ye are worthy of every gift, and deserve to adorn
your heads with the Crown of Everlasting Glory; because
in sciences and arts, in virtues and perfections, ye have
become equal to men and as regards the tenderness of
heart and the abundance of mercy and sympathy, ye are
superior.   

I received several letters from England, France and
America, each containing cheering news of the steady
growth of the beloved Cause.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 29, 1913. 

###  1. The College Life and Its Expected Results 

One of the Persian poets says:   

“All the means are prepared for thee, and yet thou art
sitting idle.   

The outcome of school and college years must be a
useful life for the community. If a child is possessed
of happy surroundings, if fortune has smiled upon him,
he must avail himself of these opportunities and daily
prepare himself — so that when he leaves college, he may
enter upon the stage of life, ready to act his part with
confidence.   

In a spiritual way we are all the children of the Heavenly
Father. He has prepared for us the means of advancement.
He has placed within our reach the instruments {{p252}} whereby we may obtain an ideal education and fit
ourselves for the service of humanity. He has given
us lessons in many ways. He has encouraged us with
words of wisdom, and has pointed out the glorious goal.
Yet some of us play truant, do not learn our lessons,
and at the time of examination fail. Do you not think
the Father will feel sad and keenly disappointed, when
he finds that His years of solicitude have brought no results?
Let us, therefore, be the studious children of
Truth; avail ourselves of all the opportunities prepared
for us — so that throughout our lives we may give happiness
to others and fulfill the expectation of the Great
Teacher.   

###  2. A Talk by an Old Bahá’í on the Sins of Backbiting 

“El-ya-hou” is an old Bahá’í. In years gone by he was
a Jew before becoming a Bahá’í, he is well conversant with
the prophesies of the Old Testament. He has a sweet
nature and loves ‘Abdu’l-Bahá more than words can express.
In the course of conversation he told us that the
Cause of the Blessed Perfection is the reality of Love
and the means of unity and concord amongst the children
of men; so that all of them may become the waves of
one sea, the radiant stars studded in one illimitable sphere,
the brilliant pearls of the shell of unity and the sparkling
gems of the mine of singleness; thus may they serve
each other from their hearts; praise and commend each
other; unloose their tongues in manifesting the good
qualities of each, and thank the Lord for His Graces
and Gifts. They must look toward the horizon of everlasting
Glory and as they attribute themselves to Bahá’u’lláh,
they must see no evil, and never speak of the faults
of others. They must shut their ears to all gossip and {{p253}} backbiting. They must be spiritual beings, with spiritual
qualities. A number of souls are walking in this straight
path, and, praise be to God, are assisted and confirmed in
all countries; but others have not yet reached this exalted,
and supreme station, and are not fully established in this
Divine Principle. This is a cause of great grief to the
heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. There is no greater obstacle to the
Cause of God than faultfinding and no greater handicap
for the word of God. The friends of God must become
the essences of union and accord, enter under the unicolored
tent of the Almighty, the expression of one great
Ideal, walk in one road, forget conflicting opinions, and
leave behind them their divergent views. Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
will be pleased with them, because he sees that they
have dedicated all their thoughts and energies to the promotion
of Love and affection, throwing into the corner
of oblivion their differences, and growing in the image
and likeness of the Creator.   

Thus “El-ya-hou” spoke from the depth of his heart.   

###  3. Permission Given to Persian Bahá’í Students to
Come to Ramleh 

Today we did not see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but he sent me
several cablegrams to be forwarded to various parts of
the world. One of these was to Haifa giving permission
to half of the Bahá’í students to come to Ramleh. There
are about thirty young Persian Bahá’ís who are students
in the American College in Beirut. As this is vacation
time they are spending their summer on Mount Carmel.
In a few days, half of them will arrive, the other half
will come later. To-night we had a meeting at the House
of <u>Kh</u>urasání. Mírzá Maḥmúd spoke on the trip of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Edinburgh. {{p254}} There were many Bahá’ís
of different nationalities.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Praises Mrs. Besant, President of the
Theosophical Society 

An interesting Tablet was sent to Mr. Graham Pole,
the Editor of the Scotland Theosophy in Edinburgh, in
which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to Mrs. Besant, the President
of the Theosophical Society. As he has spoken before
many of their societies in various cities, both in the
United States and Europe, it will not be out of place to
quote it herein, so that the friends may become informed
of its contents:   

“O THOU MY BELOVED FRIEND!   

“Thy letter was received from India. From its contents
it became evident that thou art occupied, and art
spending thy days in the company of that respected lady,
Mrs. Besant. I hope thou mayst be ever happy, serene,
confirmed and assisted; so that thou mayst become able
to render a signal service to the respected lady, Mrs.
Besant. The ideal of Mrs. Besant, I say truly is very
lofty. She is working and laboring most valiantly, and
her utmost hope is to render a service to the world of humanity,
and to be the means of the establishment of good-fellowship
and love between all the communities of the
earth. At all times I am praying in her behalf, so that
the Confirmations of the Kingdom may surround her,
that she may sow the seed of service in pure, productive
soil; and that she may gather many, many harvests; then
the heavenly benediction Will be obtained, the outpourings
of the Holy Spirit realized, and her services, troubles
and hardships crowned with eternal results. I desire
this station for her.   

“Consider how many important women have come
into this world! How many queens have lived upon this
earth! {{p255}} How many distinguished ladies have become the
presidents of Societies! But neither have their names nor
any great account of their deeds been left behind! Yet
Mary Magdalene, who was only a peasant woman, — because
she became inspired to serve the Kingdom of Christ
and to scatter his seeds in productive ground — what a
great crop she gathered! And through the blessing of
that harvest, they are even now building churches in her
name! In all the Churches the people glorify and praise
her and now, after 1900 years, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is speaking
of her lofty station! He testifies to the fact, that, in the
Kingdom of Christ she served more than all the apostles
She even became the cause of the firmness and steadfastness
of the Apostles, for, accordingly to the Text of the
Gospels, their faith wavered after the crucifixion, but
Mary Magdalene inspired them with resolution, and certainly.
Consider what a service she rendered to the
Kingdom of Christ! That is why, like unto a star, she
is shining from the horizon of Eternity.   

”Convey my most respectful greeting to the revered
Lady, Mrs Besant.   

”Upon thee be greeting and praise.   

(Signed) ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

While in America and Europe ‘Abdu’l-Bahá often
stated that the Bahá’ís must associate with the Theosophists
because they were nearer to this Cause than many
other groups.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST 30, 1913. 

###  1. Spread of Bahá’í Cause in the Interior of Turkey 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá received a letter from the interior of
Turkey, the city of Antab where the Bahá’í Cause is being
spread. He read to us a portion of it which describes
a lecture given by an Armenian before an audience of
five hundred people. The lecturer dwelt upon the trip of
the Master of Europe and America, and gave a synopsis
of the Teachings. What interested the audience more
than anything else was the principle of the Conformity
of Science and Religion, philosophy and faith. Science
and religion, he told them, have always been in accord,
but the despicable, accursed, satans (‘Ulamás) have always
sown seed of discord between them. The Master
laughed heartily when he read the above conclusion.   

###  2. Let the American Friends Wait 

Then he gave each of us the letters just received in our
names and while we were sitting in his presence, he wrote
several Tablets with his own hand. At last he told us
that he was trying to make amends for the past and was
devoting all his time to the Oriental friends. Before
leaving for America, he wrote that the Bahá’ís must excuse
him from any letter-writing, but that after his return
he would correspond with them as of old, and now
he was fulfilling his promise.   

When we left I ventured to say that many petitions
from America and Europe were accumulating and
solicited his attention. He answered me in a humorous
fashion; wait, wait a little longer. Let him now attend
to the Persian believers, and the turn of my American
friends would come soon.   

When we left his house, we were all intoxicated with
his divine Love. {{p257}} During our interview the Master spoke
a great deal with Mírzá Jalál, because one of the Princes
of Persia taught by him had written him a letter.   

###  3. Story of How a Bahá’í Feast Was Given in Ba<u>gh</u>dád 

Mírzá Jamál, our cook, told us a story about a feast
in Ba<u>gh</u>dád.   

“The Bahá’ís in Ba<u>gh</u>dád,” he said, “were not rich, but
were firm and filled with fervor. They kept the nineteen
day feast. One morning they sent word to one of the
friends that the Feast would be held in his house. He
touched his pockets and there was no money. What
should he do? He had a watch which he had bought
for ten majidis. He took it out of his pocket and sent
it to the bazaar to be sold at auction. Accidentally one of
the Bahá’ís passed by and recognized the watch. He
stopped, and saw that it was going to be sold for two
majidis. He raised the price half a dollar and bought
it. Quietly he carried it home. When night came, he
went to the meeting, and after the refreshments were
served, he approached the host and, taking the watch
out of his pocket offered it to him as a present. The
host was very much surprised, but delighted. All the
friends were pleased when they heard the story.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Writes on the Nineteen-day Feast 

I may now conclude by quoting from a Tablet, which
‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes to Mr. Jos. Hannen:   

“O thou who art firm in the Covenant!   

“Thy third report was received and its contents imparted
the utmost exhilaration. The l9-day Feast was
the Lord’s Supper, and its results are eternalized. Although
physically ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was far away, he was
present in that meeting with heart and soul. {{p258}} Truly I
say, it was a glorious feast, perfect in every way. Do
not ye look upon the present, nay rather, look into the
future. The Lord’s Supper during the lifetime of that
divine Light, had no importance in the estimation of the
public; but consider how the rays of that sun of Reality
illumined that meeting afterward... O thou my kind,
Mr. Hannen! I am most pleased with thy service, and
I hope that these services of thine shall make thee a
standard in the Divine Kingdom. Announce the utmost
kindness to Mrs. Hannen. If Mrs. Hannen can undertake
to spread broadcast the diary letters which are forwarded
to you from the East concerning the travel and
sojourn of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, it is very acceptable....”   

###  5. The Muḥammadan Month of Fasting Comes to
an End 

In two days the month of Ramaḍán will come to a
close and all restrictions will be taken away. There will be
general feasting and five holidays. To the Muḥammadans,
this is one of the most important occasions for joy-making
and for calling on each other. Already the air
is full of expectation for the coming feast!

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, AUGUST, 31, 1913. 

###  1. The Story of the Blind Man and the Serpent 

“When I was in Seesan,” said Mírzá Jalál Síná, “the
friends of God brought to me a very old man with a
patriarchal beard, and wished me to speak to him about
the Cause. {{p259}} They had often told him of the teachings, but
with no evident result. He was simple, yet fanatical,
tender-hearted, yet full of religious superstitions. At
heart a child, in body a Hercules. He had the strength
of a lion, yet his firm belief in dogmas, inspired him with
apprehension as to his future. With rough and uncouth
gestures he entered the room and squatting on the floor
cried out: — ‘Tell me now, what have you to say? I have
no patience to sit through a long sermon!’ Immediately
I got, as in a flash of lightning, how I must handle this
overgrown child of nature. I told him — ‘My friend! I
have really nothing to tell you but with your permission
I shall relate a story. Will you give me your ears?’
‘Forsooth I shall. I do love to hear a good story with
a moral to it,’ he said, his face already brightening with
interest. ‘All right, then listen with attention: — Once
upon a time there was a man of good position and fortune.
As a public servant he ranked high in the estimation
of the members of society. He had a palatial
residence, and his servants were innumerable. His stable,
stocked with Arabian and Persian horses was the pride
of the neighborhood. Many famous men sat at his table
and ate of his bounteous food. He dispensed hospitality
like a prince, and received people of all ranks with royal
courtesy and lavish splendor. As time rolled on the
heaven of his fortune became beclouded, and like the
thunders of the sky, successive reverses overtook him,
breaking the mountain of his wealth into a thousand
pieces. Soon he found himself in complete poverty. By
this time all his old friends had left him, and in the hour
of destitution, no one would condescend to so much as
recognize him. From height of opulence, he was thrown
headlong into the depth of despair and indigence. As
though these humiliations were not enough, the Fates
visited him again and made him totally blind. {{p260}} Now indeed,
the cup of his sorrow was full to overflowing, and
all doors were closed forever before his face. He was
considered an outcast, and no one would associate with
him. Finally through this chain of circumstances, he
was forced to become a beggar in the public square. One
cold morning in the winter, he left his dirty hovel and
went to his accustomed place. While he was walking, his
feet stumbled against something. He knelt down and
searched for it. He felt a long sinewy thing in his hand
and thought it was a silk whip of some special value.
He took hold of it and he walked along unconcerned. A
passer-by, frightened by the sight of the object being
carried by the blind beggar, cried out: — ‘Man! Man!
Dost thou not see what thou art holding in thy hands?
It is a serpent, it will bite thee. It will kill thee. Throw
it away quickly.’ ‘No, indeed. No indeed!’ the blind
man retorted angrily. ‘This is a silk whip which costs
at least five majidis. Feel it with thy fingers, how soft
it is. No! I shall not listen to thee. Thou art a covetous,
greedy beggar and wantest me to throw it away so that
thou mayst take it up and sell it.’ ‘Really, my friend!
This is a poisonous serpent, but the cold weather has benumbed
it, and soon the rays of the sun will bring it to
life.’ ‘No! No! Don’t talk to me like that. I will not
throw it away. If thou art very anxious to have it, I
will sell it to thee for four instead of five majidis.’ By
and by a large crowd gathered, each one calling upon
him to throw away the seemingly dead serpent, but he,
having lost all confidence inhumanity, persisted in believing
that it was a whip. In order to show his utter
contempt of public opinion, he folded the serpent and
placed it near to his skin, standing erect in the already
rising sun, in the horrified sight of the spectators. ‘What
art thou doing? Art thou thine own enemy? The serpent
will sting thee with its venomous fangs. Cast it
away while there is yet time.’ {{p261}} No! the more they insisted,
the closer he hugged it to his breast. The serpent,
warming up under the downpour of the rays of the star
of the day, started to move slowly up and down the body
of the beggar, stinging him several times. He shrieked
and cried with pain, then fell to the ground in terrible
agony. The deadly poison working up rapidly through
his body caused his death.   

“Now, my old friend, thou art in the position of that
blind beggar, because thou art hugging to thy heart the
old, superannuated symbols of a decayed and dying religion
which will not benefit thee in the least. That
serpent, however, caused the death of only the body; this
serpent causes the death of the spirit. During the past
years all these friends of thine have testified that the old
form of religion will not be conducive to thy salvation,
but like the old beggar, blindly, thou art in thine obstinacy
persisting in that this is the silk whip — my religion
is good enough for me — and not a serpent. The serpent
of superstition, ignorance and dogma is next to thy skin,
and these men cry out to thee to cast it away; so that thy
spiritual life may be saved, but no, thou wilt have none
of their advice. I portrayed his inner condition so vividly
that he commenced to shake and weep. From that time
on he became a dweller in the kingdom of Abhá, and a
most progressive member of the community.”   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to Alexandria this morning and in
order to have some papers signed by the judge, he presented
himself to the court.   

During the evening he came to our house for half an
hour, and the talk was on the coming national Fete of
Ramaḍán.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 1, 1913. 

###  1. The Watermelons of ‘Akká 

We have received fine watermelons from ‘Akká. ‘Abdu’l-Qásim
sent ten big ones for the Master and he forwarded
six of them to our house. If we cannot go to ‘Akká
now, at least the watermelons of ‘Akká come to us.
While we were enjoying them, I said that I wished that I
could send one of them to America to show the friends
how big and juicy are the watermelons of ‘Akká. Mírzá
Maḥmúd laughingly said: “Thou wouldst have sent it
if thou didst know how!”   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the Story of the Policemen
of Ramleh 

Arising early this morning <u>Kh</u>usraw entertained us with
some sidelights on the current events. He sleeps in this
house and goes to the Master’s home a little after sunrise
to begin his work. This morning he delayed his
departure, and explained the reason as follows:   

>  “All the policemen in this quarter have received generous
gifts of money and presents from the Master.
there is one who stands in <u>Kh</u>usraw’s way every morning
and tells him a long story, so that he may repeat it to
the Master who may give him some money. ‘I have
three children. My salary is not sufficient and since the
Pá<u>sh</u>á, His Excellency (‘Abdu’l-Bahá) has come here, a
new hope has dawned from the horizon of my heart.
One of my children goes to school, and for him I have
bought a pair of new shoes for the coming feast. {{p263}} The
other two who are only a few years old, left stealthily
their small beds last night and came to me without any
noise. They woke me gently and said: “Papa, papa,
we are the Furies. If thou dost not buy two other pairs
of shoes for us, we may strangle thee right now.” I
laughed and hugged them to my breast and sent them
back to their beds with a promise that if they are good,
behave well and obey their mother, then probably the
new “Pá<u>sh</u>á” may give them the shoes. Now, please,
<u>Kh</u>usraw Effendi, tell this to “Pá<u>sh</u>á.” Other policemen
whose duties are patrolling in other quarters come to
<u>Kh</u>usraw and ask him: “How long is the new ‘Pá<u>sh</u>á’
going to live here?” He says: “Probably one month!”
“Good, good! because after two weeks this quarter will
be assigned to us and then the ‘Pá<u>sh</u>á’ may be as generous
toward us as he has been to others.” 

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Talks on the Power of Imagination 

Ḥájí Níáz arrived this afternoon from Cairo and
brought us the good wishes of the believers. He is
the same happy old man with a nature of sunshine and good
will toward all. About 6 o’clock ‘Abdu’l-Bahá passed by
and called on Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl. After a few moments
Shoghi Effendi returned and brought me the good news
that I was summoned by the Master. I stood before him
on the veranda. He was speaking to Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl
on “imagination,” quoting the epigram of an Oriental
Philosopher: “Imagination is the greatest ruler in the
human world.” No matter how scientific a man may be,
yet at time, “imagination” gains an ascendancy over his
mind. For example, while a man is alive he is able to
strike, to beat, to kill, yet you sleep with him in the same
room. When he is dead, science teaches us that his body {{p264}} returns to the mineral kingdom. He can neither strike,
nor kill. The body lies there like a piece of stone, inanimate.
But you would not sleep with it in the same room.
What is the reason of this? It is the power of imagination.
It grips you with its imperial energy and overwhelms
you with invisible force. All the convincing
proofs of science will not induce you to live in the same
room with a corpse.   

Then he related a dramatic story to further illustrate
the subject, but as soon as he finished it, he turned to
me and said: “Don’t write this.” He could see in my
face how deeply interested I was! Ere long, he fell into
a deep heavenly silence, and the beautiful atmosphere
was permeated with a languorous quietness and peace.
The brilliant hosts of the sky were arrayed in shining
armor of white light, fighting bravely against the deepening
darkness. With the ears of the spirit we could
hear them chanting and praising, because the face of the
earth was illumined by the Face of its Lord.   

###  4. Oriental Bahá’ís Portray “Natural Spirituality” 

Returning home, I found a number of the friends engaged
in conversation. How happy, how carefree, how
detached thee people seem to me! They are beings created
and fashioned in other worlds. Their happiness, their
joy, their detachment are all so natural, so unconscious,
so outflowing from the springs of their hearts. There
is no affectation, no sanctimony, no religiosity. They
do not try to be spiritual. It is not through the exercise
of the will. How well ‘Abdu’l-Bahá echoes the secrets of
their inmost hearts when he writes in a recent Tablet: —   

“The days of human existence are like vanishing
shadows. With the utmost rapidity they are brought
to a close. {{p265}} From amongst mankind those who live a
heedless life are at the end, afflicted with manifest loss.
For the days of their lives will come to a sudden close,
leaving no leaves, no blossoms and no fruit. They shall
remain in the lowest degree, and no mention of them
will be left behind. From kings to servants all walk in
this path and live in this circle, except those souls who
are freed from all ties. They are not greedy after comfort,
nor are they seeking fleeting pleasures. They are
not longing for honor, neither are they chasing phantasmal
pictures of glory and wealth. They are the devotees
(or veterans) of the Blessed Perfection and are in the
utmost state of renunciation and evanescence. They are
wanderers over mountains and deserts. They call the
people to the kingdom of God, and are the cause of the
guidance of souls. Like unto candles they are ignited
with all the virtues of the world of humanity. This is
Everlasting Glory! This is Eternal Life! This is the
divine sublimity of the Creation of God!”   

Daily the cord of correspondence between the East
and the West is becoming stronger, and the interchange
of ideas more common. Each one of us must do our
humble part, no matter where we are; so that the millennium
for the coming of which we pray, may soon be established
between all peoples and nations and tongues.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 2, 1913. 

###  1. Moving Picture Theatres in Egypt 

This is the second greatest feast in the Muḥammadan
world, — the feast celebrating the passing of the month
of Ramaḍán. {{p266}} In a way it fills the place of the New
Year in America. It is called the Feast of “Beyram”
and is a national holiday. All the government departments,
offices and stores are closed for from one to five
days. The older people pay visits to each other, and
the younger generation dressed in bright colors, receive
gifts and presents, and eat much candy to their great
delight. Although the thin air of sadness broods over
many hearts owing to the Balkan wars, yet the general
impression is that of happiness, gaiety and fun. Life
to a simple-hearted Arab is like a moving picture gallery,
and he loves to see the scenes of creation unfolding
before his eyes without leaving his seat; to this we may
attribute the springing up of many nickelodeons and
cheap show-places all over Egypt who advertise their
pictures in a lurid and sensational manner. These show-places
attract a large clientele of heterogeneous elements.
On a day such as this, the managers, mostly Italians,
Greeks and Levantines, reap a golden harvest.   

###  2. The Feast of Ramaḍán and Its Spirit of Joy 

On the other hand, the religious spirit of the people
finds expression in the gorgeous decorations of the mosques
and in long hours of prayers and preaching.   

Last night Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar brought three kinds of
candies for the callers today, so this morning they were
put on different plates ready to be served. The Samovar
was boiling and the tea brewing. I was dressed and
walking on the veranda, when I saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá coming
toward our house. {{p267}} I was glad to look into his face on
this Fete day, and my heart sang the songs of joy.
What else really do we want except his good pleasure?
Is there anything more worth while? Do we not live
and move and have our being in him? Is he not the
supreme object of our lives? The sun of his unalloyed
peace shines upon all and everybody is contented.   

How thoughtful and beautiful of the Master to call
on Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl before anybody else! Is it not just
like him?   

By the time he returned to us a number of believers
and outsiders had gathered on the veranda. He greeted
them with affability, and afterwards he wished them a
happy and blessed “Beyram.” Then tea and candy
were served in turn. He beamed on the friends with
heavenly joy and cabled to the Bahá’í world the glad
news: “My health is perfect.”   

###  3. Talk on Education and the Story of a Selfish
Mother 

The subject of his talk was “Education” and the duty
of mothers toward their children, — a most appropriate
message to go out to the world of motherhood.   

He stated that fathers and especially mothers must
always think how best they should educate their children,
not how to fondle and embrace them too much and thus
spoil them. By every means at their disposal, they
must knead onto their growing bodies, souls, minds and
spirits the basic principles of sincerity, love, trustfulness,
obedience, true democracy and kindness toward
all races; thus, hereafter the world-civilization may flow
in one mighty current and the children of future generations
may secure the foundation of human solidarity
and good-will. {{p268}} From tenderest childhood, the children
must be taught by their mothers the love of God, and
the love of humanity; not the love of humanity of
Asia nor the humanity of Europe, nor the humanity of
America, but the “humanity of humanity”. There are
some mothers who have a strange, inexplicable love for
their children. One may call it the inversion of love, or
as we call it in Persia, “Bearish love”. This kind of
love does more injury to the child than good. When
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in ‘Akká, during the life of the Blessed
Perfection, he entrusted the son of one of the believers
to a German carpenter. After a month the mother
went to Bahá’u’lláh and lamented and bemoaned that
she wanted her son, because he was unhappy with the
carpenter, who cursed his religion. Bahá’u’lláh told her
to consult with Áqá (‘Abdu’l-Bahá) and abide by his
decision. She went to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and after telling her
side of the story, he said to her: ‘The Germans do not
curse any one. They are not accustomed to it.’ She
went away and after a month called again with another
complaint, saying that this carpenter had forced her son
to carry a load of wheat on his back. Again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
told her that if the carpenter had done this, it
was for her son’s discipline. Outwardly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
satisfied her, but she was murmuring inwardly. A few
months rolled by and she returned with another set of
complaints, frankly confessing that she did not want her
son to be away from her, for he was the apple of her
eye. Realizing how selfish her love was, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
told her at last that he would not take her son away,
but that he must stay with the carpenter for eight years,
until his apprenticeship was over. She yielded to the
inevitable. After eight years of study the son left his
master, and his mother was very proud of him, because
his work was in demand on all sides. {{p269}} In short, mothers
must not think of themselves, but of the progress of
their children, because upon the children of today — depends
the molding of the civilization of tomorrow.   

All day telegrams poured in from the leaders and important
men of Turkey, Egypt, Arabia, etc., congratulating
‘Abdu’l-Bahá on this Fete and wishing him a happy
“Beyram”!   

###  4. Story of the Theologian and the Sea Captain 

There was a caller on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a theological
student of the College of Azhar, and the discussion
turned upon the utter futility of Muḥammadan theology
and metaphysics, and of how some young men wasted
their lives on the study of this one branch for twenty
or thirty years. Once there was a theologian who took
a sea trip. While he was pacing the deck and watching
the calm sea, the captain passed by and inquired about
his health. Our friend was so full of his theology that
he asked the captain: “Dost thou know theology? He
answered “No.” “Then,” the student declared with
much pompous dignity, “half thy life is lost.” The
captain did not answer him but continued his walk.
Next day the sea became very stormy, and the ship was
in danger of being wrecked. The captain called on the
theologian and found him prostrated with sickness.
“Dost thou know how to swim?” he asked. “No.”
“Then all thy life is lost,” the captain thundered at him.
And you should have heard the Master laugh. Then
he quoted several of their metaphysical, hair-splitting
axioms over each one of which the theologians wrangle
and dispute days and nights.   

###  5. Story of a Metaphysician and the Correction of
His Book by a Teacher 

Another time, a theological poet, after several years
of hardship and privation, finished a book and took it to
a learned man to be read and corrected. He read the
book and found that the contents were very much like
the cobwebs of a spider, or the phantasmal imaginings
of a sickly brain. {{p270}} Therefore he marked the first and
the last pages, thus conveying the fact that the book was
not worth correcting.   

In the afternoon the Master sent all of us to the garden
of Nozha. We had a pleasant time and on our return
we heard that he had been entertaining many Arabs,
first at our house and then at that of Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl.   

###  6. Study of Science and True Religion Must Be
Combined 

At noon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told us that he did not mean that
religious study must be neglected, but that practical
sciences should be learned, so that the lives of the
students might become useful. In the future, the
theological seminaries must discard all their dogmas which
are contradictory to science and reason, and lay a basic
foundation, not to be destroyed by the fretting tooth of
time. We hope that they will accomplish this task.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 3, 1913. 

###  1. Persian Bahá’í Students of American College
Arrive 

Last night eleven young Bahá’ís arrived from Haifa.
They are students in the American College at Beirut.
and have been passing their summer vacation on Mount
Carmel, waiting impatiently for permission to visit the
Master. {{p271}} These are not all of them. When the present
party leaves for Haifa, another one composed of an
equal or larger number, will come. They are all young
boys from 8 to 18 years. studying in various branches
of science, and equipping themselves to become useful
members of the body politic. Morally pure, intellectually
keen, spiritually susceptible, mentally alive, they combine
with these qualities rare power of reserve, simplicity,
naturalness and dignity of character, seldom to
be witnessed in other youths of the same age. Every one
knows by memory many communes and supplications,
and this morning after drinking tea, they sat around
and chanted Tablets. The American spirit of freedom
and activity is in their constitutions. They will become
fine and progressive citizens of Persia, when they return
to that country. Although their names may sound unfamiliar
to our American friends across the ocean,
yet they may be of interest. They are as follows: — Mírzá
‘Azíz’u’lláh <u>Kh</u>án, Mírzá ‘Alí-Muḥammad <u>Kh</u>án,
Mírzá ‘Adu’l-Ḥusayn <u>Kh</u>án, Mírzá Maḥmúd <u>Kh</u>án, Mírzá
‘Abdu’l-Ḥasan <u>Kh</u>án, all of <u>Sh</u>íráz; Mírzá Aflatún of
Hamadán, Mírzá ‘Alí Áqá of Ra<u>sh</u>t, Mírzá Maḥmúd
<u>Kh</u>án of Iṣfahán, Qudsí Effendi of Haifa and Áqá
Siyyid Gasem of Sabzivár.   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent for me and after a few minutes talk,
told me to go and bring the students. I conducted them
to the house and they were ushered into the reception
room. Hardly a minute had passed when the Master
appeared. They all rose to their feet and although he
told them not to do it, yet one after another knelt before
him and kissed the hem of his garment, his hands or his
feet. {{p272}} This is the highest sign of respect, nay rather
adoration, and flows from the depth of their hearts.
It is spontaneous and natural, full of sweetness and attachment.
It is neither dictated by custom nor ceremony.   

###  2. Persian Students in Paris and London 

He told them that they were very welcome! He had
been longing to see them, but up to this time the way
was not open. Was their vacation spent pleasantly in
Haifa on Mount Carmel? The College of Beirut was
very good. They could not realize how some of the
Persian students spent their time in profitless pursuits
in London and Paris. Not only did the Europeans look
down upon them, as members of an inferior race and
half-civilized, but they (the students) confirm them in
this opinion by indulging in the questionable pleasures
and vices of the European lower society. They hardly
do any study. The major part of their time is spent in
the gratification of the appetites, such as sensuality, attending
dance halls and theaters, wine drinking, association
with undesirable members of the community in
which they live, and leading an insipid and voluptuous
life, ruinous to themselves and the Persian nation
alike.... Praise be to God that the faces of these Bahá’í
students were radiant; the rays of the love of God were
shining from their countenances. He was most pleased
to have met them. It is very strange that when a face
is not illumined with the light of the Love of God, it
is dark, and when you look into it, the traces of the
divine Glad-tidings are not manifest, but when the
light of God shines upon it, it becomes bright and enlightened,
as it is said: — {{p273}} “In their faces you shall see the
verdancy of Paradise and in their countenances there
is the sign of worship.”   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Tells the Students How to Study 

Afterward the Master left the house to call on Osman
Pá<u>sh</u>á, and in his company, a visit was paid to the
Khedive who celebrated the feast yesterday in Cairo,
and today in Alexandria. Before noon, the Master
came to our house to meet the students. He told them
that it was his hope that they would make extraordinary
progress along spiritual lines as well as in science and
art; so that each one might become a brilliant lamp in
the world of modern civilization, and upon their return
to Persia that country might profit from their acquired
knowledge and experience.   

###  4. The Students Read ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Talks in
America 

In the hands of the students there were copies of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s address given before the Forum Club of
San Francisco. He asked one of them what he was
holding in his hand? The student presented it to him
and he read the last portion concerning the philosophers
and the cows, and how the modern materialists should
go to the cow to learn the principles of materialism.
After speaking on some other subjects, he left us. The
students are all eager to take down every word which he
says to them and they are writing to their parents and
friends the incidents of their trip ad of their experiences.   

Before he left he told Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar to accompany
all the students to the Persian Consulate at 4 P.M. As
we are quite numerous, both dinner and supper are served
in turn; {{p274}} first the students sit around the table, and afterwards
the rest of us.   

###  5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Calls on the Persian Consul 

At 4 o’clock, we found ourselves in the large reception
room of the Persian Consulate General in Alexandria.
For the first half hour we were entertained by the Consul,
then the Master came and spoke with him in Turkish.
The Consul is a genial old man, and loves the Master
very deeply.   

When we returned home, the Master had arrived
ahead of us, and was talking with a number of prominent
callers. At night we had an unusual gathering, full
of interest, many of the Bahá’ís related the story of how
they first embraced the Cause of God.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 4, 1913. 

###  1. The Story of the Royal Bird Gedam 

The Eastern mind is a treasure-house of mystic
stories, each one fraught with significant lessons. One
of these beautiful stories was related to me the other
day by Mírzá Jalál Síná, and fore-shadows the coming
of the Manifestation of God into this world. I report
it here without its interpretation, knowing that my readers
will supply it by their own imagination: —   

Far, far away in a jungle, inaccessible to man, beyond
the Indian ocean, there lived a bird of royal birth,
majesty and beauty. Her name was Gedam. {{p275}} Her song
was endowed by the Creator of Mankind with incomparable
beauty, richness, sweetness, and charm. The
strains of her natural melodies belonged to other than
this material world, which is full of the cawing of crows,
the cackling of geese and the twittering of sparrows.
Whenever Gedam began to sing, she raised her melody
to such a lofty height as to silence all the other birds,
who were ashamed of their own weak, discordant voices noises.
Thus were they discomfited and filled with envy and
regret, and wondered what they could do to bring about
the end of Gedam. Finally they arranged a large meeting
in which they might deliberate as to how they should
heap vengeance upon her unsuspecting head and cause
her death.   

After much consultation, they agreed upon the plan
of destroying the eggs of Gedam whenever and wherever
she laid them; so that her descendants might not
increase. In order to carry out this plan with vigilance,
they appointed a committee to execute the decree. They
agreed amongst themselves that they would continue to
break the eggs of Gedam till the time came when she
would grow old and die, thus protecting themselves
from the power of such a rival. For a number of years
Gedam patiently endured the persecution of these little
birds who were exulting over the success of their plan
in thus systematically destroying her eggs and not letting
her progeny increase. Gedam never said anything
nor manifested any trace of concern. Then at a time
when the birds were away from their nests, she laid one
egg in each and flew away, perching on the loftiest
branch and singing her own entrancing melody. The
other birds, not knowing exactly what had happened,
sat as usual on their eggs, and after a while the little
ones stepped out of their narrow world into open space.
Tenderly and with much solicitude and devotion were
they taken care of, and from the mother birds’ beaks the
little ones were fed. {{p276}} Soon their dear growing wings
were covered with soft feathers like unto velvet, and the
parents were delighted to see their darling offspring developing
into the size of birdhood. Gedam from the
loftiest branch was watching, how day after day, her
children were nurtured by these different birds with a wistful
tenderness and sympathy as though they were their
own. Then, when she observed that they had reached
the flying stage, she perched on the highest green branch,
filling the empty void with her wonderful music, which
vibrated, and rocked through the atmosphere. The
little birds who were her real children, heard the clear,
resonant melody and finding its exact similarity to their
own, and realizing from the depth of their hearts, their
true kinship with the invisible singer, suddenly fluttered
their wings, and up they soared to join their Mother.
Out of every nest a number of birds such as doves,
partridges, sparrows, crows, nightingales, blue-birds, etc.
who had become accustomed to the harmonious companionship
of the children of Gedam, joined them in their
flight. Although they were of various forms, colors
and species, voices and kinds, — they soared together with
love and sweet fellowship, toward the azure height and
there composed a divine company, circling and circling
around their beloved mother, as the songs of thanksgiving
and gratitude with soft appealing notes flowed like a clear
stream from their hearts.   

###  2. Purity and Chastity the Foundation of Spiritual
Life 

While the students and other pilgrims were drinking
tea, the Master entered the house. He walked through
the rooms and inquired about the health of each. Then
he went to the veranda and sat down. {{p277}} The first thing
that he said, showed his interest in the welfare of the
students. He asked Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar to take them to
Nozha Park. Then, introducing them to an Arab Bahá’í,
he remarked, that these students were doing well with
their studies and that in reality they were the cause of
his happiness.   

He also gave a most interesting talk on what the
students should study while in Europe, and what they
should shun. After giving a minute account of the
social customs of the Western people, he told us that
chastity and purity are two divine standards of the
spiritual and moral law. The greater the aims of a man
the nobler his deeds; man must ever be thoughtful of
others and polite and courteous toward his fellow beings.
This will win for him the good-pleasure of the Lord and
the satisfaction of the general public. One’s sitting and
rising, conduct and manner, speech and conversation,
social intercourse and communication, must be based
upon a firm foundation and be conducive to the Glory
of the world of humanity.   

###  3. The Brother of the Khedive Calls on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

In the afternoon Prince Muḥammad-‘Alí, the brother of
the Khedive, called on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Prince arrived
in his automobile at the door of our house, and hearing
that the Master lived close by in another one, said that
he would walk to it. Mírzá Munír was bout to go on
ahead to notify ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, when he appeared in his
long, loose, cream-colored coat from the other side of the
street. Thus, in the middle of the road, the Master and
the Prince met, each offering to the other courtesies designated
for the most distinguished men. Every one
looking at this strange scene wondered, while trying to
imagine what had brought a royal Prince of Egypt to the
Threshold of ‘Abbás Effendi. {{p278}} The Master was walking
ahead and the Prince a few feet behind, and while they were
talking in the most animated manner, they disappeared
from our view.   

###  4. American Ice Cream for Students — Their Visit to the
National Park 

Late in the afternoon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to visit the
pilgrims and after a few minutes went to see Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl, from which place he returned home to rest.   

Before the students left for Nozha Garden, <u>Kh</u>usraw
brought a jar of American ice cream, prepared for them
by Mrs. Getsinger. It was very good, and everybody enjoyed
it.   

###  5. The Student’s Love for the Bahá’í Cause 

All day there were different groups here and there, each
speaking about the Cause and putting forth arguments to
prove the Dawn of the Sun of Reality. It seems to me
that these young men are very devoted to the Movement,
and free, and ready to receive and assimilate all kinds of
useful information. I have no doubt that from amongst
them a number of most capable teachers will arise.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 5, 1913. 

###  1. Who Is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and What Is He Doing? 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá is eloquent in his silence and speaks with
the tongue of the angels in the congregation of the elect.
His heavenly songs, stream down from unknown heights.
Like unto the bird of Paradise, he raises his voice and
humanity hears it. His heart is a variegated rose-garden
whose fragrant narcissuses of knowledge, gentle violets
of wisdom, sweet anemones of love and graceful hyacinths
of sympathy spread their perfume. The heaven
of his mind is begemmed with orbs of reality, dispelling
the darkness of doubt. The grandeur of his spirit, the
sublimity of his ideals and the epic events of his life are
the noblest examples set before the eyes of man. To the
wanderer he is a refuge; to the thirsty he is a cooling
spring, to the poor he is a treasury of wealth; to the
despondent he is a source of inspiration; to the orphan
he is a kind father; to the sick he is a physician; to the
weak, he is a power-house of energy; to the hungry he
is a divine table.   

###  2. The Persian Students and Prayers 

Every morning presents to my view a happy scene of
worship, because all the students pray before sunrise.
They attract to themselves a moral force, infusing into
their lives that quality of Faith which changes hate into
love, strangeness into friendship, and enmity into amity.
Through prayer their minds are polished and their hearts
purified with the fire of the Love of God. They attain
to the station of confidence, realize the divinity of holiness,
are drawn unto God, and become clear mirrors in
which the ideal images of the Kingdom are reflected.
They put forth green leaves of hope and blossoms of radiant
acquiescence. {{p280}} With prayer, they learn their lessons;
with prayer they take their examinations; with
prayer they make intellectual progress and with prayer on
their lips they rise in the early morning ad go to sleep
at night.   

Today I was speaking about the servants of the Cause
and Mírzá Jalál Síná told me the following story.   

###  3. The Story of a Man Who Was Hired to Build a
Wall Around a Garden 

A man hired a mason to build a wall around his
garden. The next morning the mason came to start his
work. The foundations were already laid by other laborers,
and an assistant was hired to pass him the bricks.
At the moment when the first one was handed to him
a friend of his passed by and was hailed to come near,
and they engaged in a lively conversation. The mason
forgot all about the building of the wall, and the time
slipped by until noon. He had yet the first brick in his
hand when the hour of twelve struck. At that time the
owner of the garden arrived on the scene, and seeing
the work not even started, dismissed him and brought
another mason to do it in his place.   

###  4. In the Cause of Brotherhood There Are No Titles 

There are some souls who are similarly situated. When
a work is entrusted to them by the Great Builder, they
take it as a personal thing. They do as much of it as they
think advisable according to their limited understanding
or do not do it at all. In such a case the Great Builder
without telling them anything about it, takes the work
out of their hands and entrusts it to those who will dispatch
it with the utmost rapidity. {{p281}} Personalities do not
count in this Cause; work, enduring work, patient impersonal
work is called for. There are no titles in this
Movement. Let all the workers banish such dreams
from their minds. In God’s estimation the laborers are
all equal. We are all His servants. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
taken the title of the “Servant of God” and the servant
of humanity. Every sincere soul, according to his ability,
must strive day and night to walk in this path. The divine
path is the path of servitude, humility, evanescence, — severance from aught else save God, and service.   

###  5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Inquires from the Persian Students
about Their Teachers 

At 8 o’clock ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came and all the students
were ready to receive him. He inquired about their health
and if they were comfortable in their present quarters.   

He asked them to tell him whether the teachers took
pains to instruct the students, or if like some professors,
they went through the lessons as machines without showing
any feeling or interest in the progress of the pupils?   

###  6. People Are Not Awake to the Danger of War 

Holding in his hand several copies of his American
addresses which had been published in the newspapers, he
informed us that the people of Egypt were not interested
in them and that any reference to them would bring only
the answer, “very excellent,” “very good.” However,
they were interested in the most unimportant news of the
day. They are not thinking of those principles which
will build up the future civilization of mankind; yet they
acknowledge the fact that the world of humanity is in
great danger, and is going through a most crucial period.
Although war may cease temporarily, yet there is an invisible
war constantly carried on which is a tremendous
economic loss. {{p282}} These unseen drains are breaking the
financial backs of the nations. They do not know by
what means or instruments the comity of nations, or the
peace of the world can be achieved.   

###  7. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Dictates Tablets for American Bahá’ís 

Then he told me to have the letters ready, and in a few
moments I was following him toward the garden. He
was glad to be away from the people, and for three hours
he dictated Tablets for the friends beyond the seas. Some
of those who were honored with Tablets were the following:
Miss Jean Masson, Mrs. Gertrude Diffet, the Editor
of the “Master Mind” in Los Angeles, Mrs. Harriet Cline,
Mrs. Mary C. Bell, Miss General Jack, Mrs. Thornberg
Cropper, Mrs. Anna Killius, Mr. Horace Holley, Mrs.
Fred Mortenson, Madame H. Maron, Mrs. Stansell, Miss
Juliet Thompson, consul General Topakeyan, Miss Edna
MacKinny and Miss Maria Wilson.   

Yesterday the Master’s daughter left for Cairo with
Ba<u>sh</u>ír, for a short stay. Today Shoghi Effendi joined
his mother with Ḥájí Níáz. In the afternoon four Bahá’ís
arrived from Cairo.   

###  8. Program for a National or Religious Feast 

About 4 o’clock, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came again and gave us an
interesting talk on how a religious, or national Fete
should be celebrated.   

The program for such fete days must be so prepared
to yield a permanent result. As these are day of
freedom from work, the leaders of the communities must
discuss such problems as may be beneficial to the individuals
and the outcome of which will be eternal. {{p284}} They must
be occupied with prayers and thanksgiving, and be grateful
for the Favors and Bounties of God.   

###  9. Driving around with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

Then he called me to follow him. Outside a carriage
was waiting. He beckoned me to sit beside him and told
<u>Kh</u>usraw to sit next to the driver. We stopped at the Hotel
Plaisance and took Mr. Atwood with us. The carriage
drove for more than one hour on the shore of the Nile.
We passed many large palm groves and the Arab hovels
of Fellaheens. These Arabs live in real squalor. Pigs,
hens, donkeys, goats sleep with them in the same mud
rooms. Arriving at the Nozha, we drove through its
shady avenues and our eyes were brightened by the wonderful
flowers. The Master left the carriage and we
passed into the place where the band was playing and
where more than two hundred Englishmen were picnicking
with their families. He walked through the Park
and finally sat down on the side of a well. He was steeped
in a world of thought. Then he went away from us and
sat on the green grass. For nearly 15 minutes he remained
there undisturbed. The sun was sinking behind
the western sky when our carriage was driven homeward.
The Master putting his arm around the shoulders of Mr.
Atwood told him that he went driving today especially
for him as he loved him very much. He was most pleased
with him, because he had resigned his will to the Will of
God.   

Mr. Atwood thanked him for his kindness and said:   

“Master, I think often of you and of your great work.
I can never forget the time when you called at a mission
school in Alexandria. {{p284}} The principal in greeting you,
said: ‘You are the father of the poor and I am their
servant!’ You answered: ‘I am the servant of the poor,
but you are their father!’”

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 6, 1913. 

###  1. The American Bahá’ís must make great efforts in
teaching the Cause of Peace. 

When I stood in the Master’s presence this morning,
he asked me whether I had any news. Then in a talk he
emphasized the fact that the American Bahá’ís must, with
one accord, and one voice unite in raising the pillars of
Universal Peace in their regions. God will reinforce them
with the Powers of the Kingdom if they arise wholeheartedly
in the service of this Cause. They have every
means at their disposal, and no lack of extraordinary desire
to do the will of God. By example and by deeds they
have seen the workings of the Glorious Lord. Now that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is in the Orient, he loves to hear that the
seeds of Truth which he has sown in the West are beginning
to sprout, that the ideals of Peace which he has
diffused are taking root in the hearts. They must gird
up the loins of endeavor, enter the arena of activity and
let the reports of their fresh triumphs gladden the heart
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.   

###  2. Prof. Armenius Vambery’s Letter to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

Before I left his presence, he handed me a letter written
to him by Prof. Vambery of Budapest, who met him during
his sojourn in that city. {{p285}} On his arrival in Port Sa‘íd,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá revealed for him a Tablet and sent him a
Persian rug as a present. I will translate the letter as a
matter of historical interest. The Professor’s letter is in
Persian:   

“I forward this humble petition to the sanctified and
Holy Presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás, who is famous
throughout the world, the Center of Knowledge, and beloved
by all mankind!   

“O thou kind, noble friend, thou who art conferring
guidance upon humanity — may my life be a ransom to
thee!   

“The loving epistle which you have condescended to write to
this servant and the rug which you have forwarded,
came to hand safely. The meeting with your
Excellency and being in your Presence, which is full of
benediction, recurs to the memory of this servant and
I am longing for the time when I shall meet you again.
In reality, although I have traveled throughout many
countries and cities of Islám, yet I have never met a lofty
character and exalted personage to compare with your
Excellency, and I bear witness that it is not possible to
find one. On this account I am hoping that the Ideals
and accomplishments of your Excellency may be crowned
with success, and yield results under all circumstances;
because, behind these Ideals and deeds, I easily observe
the future welfare and prosperity of the world of humanity.   

“This servant, in order to gain first hand information
and experience, entered the ranks of various religions;
that is, outwardly I became a Jew, a Christian, a Muḥammadan
and a Fire-worshiper. I discovered that the
devotees of these different religions do nothing else but
hate and anathematize each other; {{p286}} that all these religions
have become the instruments of tyranny and oppression
in the hands of rulers and governors, and that they are
causes for the destruction of the world and of humanity.
Considering these evil results, every person is forced by
necessity to be enlisted on the side of your Excellency
and embrace rejoicingly, the prospect of the Universal
Religion which is being ushered in through your effort.   

“I have seen the father of your Excellency from afar
and have realized the self-sacrifice and noble courage of
His Son, and my admiration has been increasing. For the
principles and aims of your Excellency, I express the
utmost respect and devotion and if God, the most High,
confers a long life upon me, I will be able to serve you
under all conditions. I pray and supplicate for this from
the depth of my heart.   

(Signed) “Your servant, Vambery.”   

###  3. The Persian Students meet Mrs. Getsinger 

In the reception room of the house of the Beloved the
students met Mrs. Getsinger. She spoke to them most
beautifully and they listened with rapt attention. None
of them had yet seen or heard an American Bahá’í. She
related for their benefit, the story of the Beloved’s lecture
in Columbia University of New York, and in Stanford
University of California and when she told about Mortenson,
and of how he traveled from Minneapolis to
Green Acre — under the trains — and of how he was received
first by Mr. and Mrs. Ed. Kinney and later by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, all eyes were dim with tears. {{p287}} Then she
spoke about spiritual knowledge, prayer, and the conformity
of science and faith, and at the end chanted a
prayer by Bahá’u’lláh.   

###  4. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Speaks on the Power of Unity 

Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came in and said that God had
brought us together in Ramleh. No other power could
ever have accomplished this. We were meeting with the
utmost joy and fragrance. Spiritual attraction had united
us. The Divine outpourings and the Bestowals of the
Blessed Perfection had called us to this heavenly banquet.
Just as in this material world we were brought together
at this meeting, similarly may we associate with one another
in the kingdom of Abhá.   

In the afternoon the Beloved dictated several important
Tablets, and later entertained the French Consul of Haifa
who had come to meet him.   

Many hours today were spent in writing and in listening
to the delightful stories related by Mírzá Jalál Síná.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 7, 1913. 

###  1. The Story of the Mythical Republic and of a Curious
Way of Electing a President 

Let me relate to you the story of a poor man and how
he became the Ruler of one of the ancient Republics.
Back of it you will detect the spiritual history of God and
His relation with mankind.   

Years and years ago the inhabitants of the country
of ... who enjoyed a sort of Republic, had a most curious
way of electing their President. The people
gathered once a year in the largest public square of the
capital. {{p288}} Then they would bring out the golden cage of
the bird, “Homai,” and place it at the head of the procession
of dignitaries, amidst universal rejoicing, while
the music of the national band played. After many ceremonies,
and the delivery of eloquent addresses, they would
open the gate of the cage and release the bird Homai
before the eyes of all the citizens. The bird, gaining its
freedom, would rise higher and higher toward the blue
ether, and then descend on the head of an individual in
the crowd, whom the people would hail as the next Ruler.   

It was on such an important election day that a stranger
entered the city. He observed decorations of flags and
bunting, and the streets filled with seething humanity.
Every avenue, like a tributary to the sea, emptied its rushing
people into the great public square. All the seats, tier
upon tier, were filled. After much pushing and pulling,
the stranger found his way to the square, where a wonderful
spectacle met his view. He was thunderstruck at
the lavish splendor of this sight. While he was looking
at it, he felt some one tapping on his shoulder. He was
hot and pressed on all sides. “What do you want, man?
Do you not see that I am nearly dying of suffocation?”
“Wilt thou make me thy aide-de-camp if thou art elected
President of the Republic?” “Pooh! Art thou gone
insane, man? I have just entered this city and know not
a single soul. I would like to know who would elect an
absolute stranger to the highest position in the Republic?”
“I think thou dost not know the laws of this country,
neither is there any time for their explanation. Just give
me thy word now.” “All right,” the stranger laughed
aloud. “If I ever become the President of the Republic,
thou wilt be my aide-de-camp.”   

Hardly was this promise given, when he felt the sudden
weight of something upon his head. Then he heard the
deafening hurrah of the great multitude which filled the
air and which rocked the very foundations of the buildings.
The bird “Homai” had sat upon his head, and he
was already, by the sovereign will of the people, the President.
The notification committee, followed by the most
prominent citizens, informed him of his election, and with
much solemnity conducted him to the capital. {{p289}} For one
week there were great festivities in the capital. Fireworks
and illuminations, athletic games and banquets,
brilliant processions, and public receptions, attracted the
attention of all the classes of citizens. The inaugural
ball, which brought to a close these successive festivities,
eclipsed all other events in points of brilliancy.   

To the delight and satisfaction of Congress and the
Cabinet members — the new President showed extraordinary
knowledge on all public questions, and an intuitional
grasp of necessary reforms. These reforms had
been needed for a long time, but the nation had not been
fortunate enough to have a man at the helm of the government
who could make them possible for practical legislature.   

Soon after his inauguration, the president received a
letter from an unknown man, reminding him of his
promise. He sent for him immediately, and found in
him the requirements of an aide-de-camp. In the course
of mutual association, they became great friends and one
day, the aide-de-camp said to the President in an off-hand
manner: “do you know what is going to happen to
you after the expiration of your Presidential term?”
“No, I have never thought about it.” “Well, I will tell
you, because you have been very kind to me. When your
term expires, the citizens will come to the Palace, drive
you out of your executive office, ask you to put on your
old clothes, take you through the streets, make you ride
backward on a donkey, and at the head of a sneering,
ridiculing mob, parade you through the avenues and
bazaars. {{p290}} In this ignominious manner the procession will
leave the city. They will proceed for several miles until
they reach a broad river on the other side of which is an
island. Then they will place you in a bat, and a boatman
will row you to the other side. There he will leave
you and return. As the island is surrounded by the
water, there can be no communication with the outside
world.”   

The President was quite disturbed by this account.
“Why did you not tell me of this before?” “Firstly,
I did not know you; secondly, this knowledge could not
prevent ‘Homai’ from alighting on your head; thirdly,
even should you have known this, the people would not
have accepted your refusal.” “But, have I not given them
a wise and efficient administration, and on that ground,
am I not entitled to a second election?” “You must realize
that the people are not electing you. It depends upon
the caprice of a bird, and I am sure, that even if they let
you stay in the public square on the election day, you
would not have the remotest chance of being re-elected.
On the other hand, no power on earth, except the will of
the whole people of this Republic, can amend this provision
of the constitution. It is simply impossible.”
“Then what must I do? Will you give me your advice?”
“Well, you can do one thing. As long as you live in this
Palace, you have a perfect right to expend your salary on
any undertaking you deem most necessary and urgent.
You are able to select a number of architects, masons,
engineers and laborers, send them to the island, and give
them the commission of building a commodious house, in
which you may live during the remaining years of your
life. I have been aide-de-camp to many former Presidents,
and in every instance I have urged them to do this,
but they were so occupied with the gratification of their
own desires, that they did not heed my advice, and the
time slipped by. {{p291}} Suddenly they saw that the year had
expired, and they found themselves in manifest loss.”   

This President, however, was of a different disposition,
and from that day on, he devoted his leisure hours to the
construction of a house on the Island. When the term
of his service expired, he went through all the strange
rites prescribed by the law with a cool head, a confident
heart, and a serene mind, because he knew that on the
other side, everything was prepared to receive him....   

After a few days on the Island, he started to explore
it, and here and there came across a number of emaciated
and starved looking men who were clothed in tattered
garments. He asked them, “Who are you?” They answered:
“We are the former Presidents of the Republic
of X. We were not as wise and as far-seeing as you have
proven to be. While we filled our Presidential Offices,
we thought only of our own importance, and pursued the
pleasures and vanities of life, instead of thinking of enduring
and eternal principles. We never troubled our
minds about our future, neither did we heed the admonitions
of our friend. Thus this present misery is the
result of our own past heedlessness.”   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Spends a Busy Day 

This morning the students were summoned into the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and he gave them a stirring talk
on the union of the East and the West, and of how the
Cause of Harmony was set aglow and the hearts of mankind
and how its flame is getting stronger and stronger every
day.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 8, 1913. 

###  1. The Arab Bahá’ís Give a Feast to the Persian Students 

Five of the young Arabian Bahá’ís acted as hosts to
the students, and the friends. {{p292}} The feast was given in the
garden of Nozha. The tablecloth was spread under
the shade of the trees and forty of us sat around it. The
dinner was delicious, and our Arabian friends dispensed
true old-fashioned Oriental hospitality. during the day,
Tablets were chanted, songs were sung, short speeches
delivered and the spirit of Bahá’í friendship deeply felt.
Although there existed no outward relation between the
Arab and the Persian Bahá’ís, yet they conversed together
with great sympathy as though they belonged to the same
family. After dinner we were divided into small groups
and walked through the Park. On our return, we found
the Samovar boiling and tea prepared.   

###  2. How an Arab Became a Bahá’í 

One of the hosts told us how he was first attracted
to the Cause: “Two years ago, a similar picnic was held
here on this very spot by the Bahá’ís. I passed by, and
looking at them, saw a divine happiness upon their faces.
I became curious, and began to ask questions. Soon I
obtained the privilege of entering the kingdom of Bahá’u’lláh.
Now, all of these men who are passing by, looking
at us with wondering eyes, who knows but there may
be some who will become Bahá’ís, two years from now?”   

###  3. Importance of Agriculture 

When we returned home we found ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dictating
Tablets in the garden. Mírzá Munír was the
secretary. Several new men were permitted to go into
his presence. {{p293}} Later he sent for the students, because
they had not seen him in the morning. He spoke with
them on the subject of agriculture and the present need
for it in Persia. He asked them whether such a course
was given in the Beirut College. He laid great stress upon
the study of scientific agriculture and encouraged them to
become the teachers of this science and the spreaders of
its principles. He concluded, saying that he expected the
appearance of great things from them.   

###  4. A Prayer for the Illumination of Mankind 

One of the prayers changed by the students today in
the Nozha garden is the following:   

“He is El Abhá!   

“O Thou pure God! Make thou this gathering the
candle of the world and suffer this assembly to become a
rose garden and a verdant meadow. Let its meeting become
a delectable paradise and its horizon the dawning-place
of the lights of the Merciful. Perfume Thou the
nostrils of the dwellers of the Mount of the Friend with
its Fragrance and rejoice the hearts of the pilgrims of the
Holy city of the Desired One with its amber-scented
breeze. Protect Thou these souls under the shadow of
an asylum of Protection in the fortress of Thy Majesty,
the One, the Most High! Shower upon us the Confirmations
of Thy Abhá Horizon and bestow upon us the
Graces of Thy Supreme Concourse. Although we are
birds without feathers and wings, yet have we built our
nests and homes in the gardens of Thy Cause. We have
taken refuge at the Threshold of Thy Oneness, and we
are begging of Thee Confirmation, help and aid. {{p294}} When
we look upon ourselves, we are smaller than the atoms;
when we behold the sea of Thy Generosity and Liberality,
we see the atoms as brilliant suns, nay rather, more
brilliant!   

“O Thou Kind King! Cover the sins of these weak
ones with the hem of the garment of Thy Mercy. Change
the indifference of these heedless ones into the essence
of fidelity, wisdom and understanding! Grant the souls
a loftier effort and cast another tumult in the heads; so
that they may sing the melody of the Supreme Realm,
seek after the Everlasting Glory, long for the delicacies of
the New World, soar toward the highest horizon, enter
into the congregation of the Almighty and become the
recipients of the Bestowals of the Kingdom of Abhá!
Thus the dark world will become luminous, the satanic
field will be transformed into the Court of the Merciful,
this mound of earth will become the celestial heaven, and
this terrestrial globe the Eternal Rose-garden. Verily
Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Hearer and the
Seer.   

“‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

###  5. The object of the Coming of Bahá’u’lláh 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes in a Tablet: — 

“O ye real friends! And ye who are drawn to the
Beauty of God! This is the time of attraction and acclamation,
and the period of rejoicing and merrymaking.
This is the morn of Glad-tidings! Is it not suffused with
splendors? The Candle of the world is bestowing light
upon all the assemblages. Is it not luminous? The
Manifest Orb is rising from the dawning-place of the
Most High! Is it not Glorious? The Blessed Perfection
and the Most Great Name — may my life be a ransom to
His believers, arose in the city of self-sacrifice like unto
the banner of Guidance. {{p295}} While he was under the chain,
He was a helper to every oppressed! From the Manifest
horizon, He shone forth glorified by trials! In the midst
of the world, He withstood the attacks of infinite persecutions;
so that these withered ones might become enkindled,
and these extinguished souls might be set aglow
with the Fire of the Love of God. May we close our
eyes to both worlds, and be ignited and burn with the
Fire of Longing! Now, O ye spiritual friends! Is it
just that we sit silent, become speechless, sorrowful and
pessimistic! No by God! This is not the attribute of
fairness and gratitude, but the essence of unfairness and
negligence.”   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 9, 1913 

###  1. A Bird’s Eye View of the General Conditions of
the World 

Would you like to hear the translation of a Tablet
which was read this morning? It contains a wonderful
spirit and a most significant exposition of the general
conditions of the world at this time.   

“He is God!   

“O Thou who art holding fast to the Pure Hem; thou
who art the twig of the Blessed Tree!   

“Look thou with deep insight at the world and the inhabitants
thereof! {{p296}} It is an immense theater upon the
stage of which most spectacular plays are being enacted.   

“Here, thou wilt see upon its plains the victorious and
vanquished legions of profit and loss and there, thou wilt
observe the waves of the sea of folly, rising and falling
with great impetuosity. Cries are heard on every side,
and the agonies of revolution, revolt and unrest reach to
the ears of every progressive man.   

“There is a tremendous clash and strife between capital
and labor and the war between the aristocratic and the
democratic adherents is carried on with relentless sword,
javelin, bow and arrow. The phalanxes of the grand
Army are drawn in battle array, each squadron taking
its position. The world-raging armaments and the heavy
artillery are prepared in every part of the field. The
dazzling splendor of the swords of enmity blind the eyes
from the most remote distance; the lightning effect of
breastplates, the brilliancy of the lances and the sparkle
of the bucklers of hatred brighten the gloomy night and
bewilder our eyes.   

“In short the weapons for strife, battle, and war are
being prepared with the utmost celebration.   

“Thou wilt observe that from every house, the strains
and notes of music are raised, the confusing melodies of
harp, lyre, cymbal and flute are heard, and the mad revelers
dance while in a state of inebriation with the wines
of these vanishing pleasures and joys.   

“Here, thou wilt see wanton and soiled decorations,
and there, flimsy shows of a gilded class of creatures.
Here, embellishment and luxury is made possible through
illicit wealth, and there are displayed the ravishingly
beautiful appearances of this mortal and ephemeral existence.
>From one part of the world sighs of anguish,
lamentations of poverty and agonies of misery are raised,
and from another voices, acclamations and Jeremias calling
for succor have reached the gates of heaven! {{p297}} Here,
one sees the tears of the hopeless and listens to the appeals
of the oppressed; there, the trembling murmurs of the
helpless and the harrowing wails of the shipwrecked in
the sea of perfection. The heat of the conflagration of
separation spreads on all sides: the flame of the fire
of longing is raging with great intensity, and the tongue
of an avalanche of calamities leaps forth. Here, one observes
the absolutism and oppression of kings, and the
utter thoughtlessness of the Cabinet ministers, and there,
one sees conflicts and wars on the battlefields of thoughts
and ideals by ambitious generals, statesmen and administrators
of the nation and countries. They consult together,
they scheme, they plot, they exchange their views,
they organize fallacious enterprises, they float superfluous
companies, they circulate false notes, they destroy and
they lay the foundation of their political careers.   

“In short, when thou considerest the reality, the outcome,
and the fruit of all these theatrical performances,
thou wilt see with thy real eyes, that they are the results
of an illusory mirage and their sweetness is as bitter
poison. A few days shall roll on their axis, and all these
conditions will become non-existent, evanescent and completely
forgotten. But when thou shuttest thine eyes to
this dark world, looking upward and heavenward, thou
wilt behold light upon light, eternity onward to eternity,
and from everlasting to everlasting. Then thou wilt see
the realities of Mysteries.... Therefore, happy is the
pure spirit who does not attach himself to the changing
conditions of this transitory world; and who clings rather
to the Purity, Nobility and Grandeur of the Never-ending
world.   

“Upon thee be Bahá!   

(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

###  
2. The Spread of the Bahá’í Cause in Germany Makes
‘Abdu’l-Bahá Happy 

This morning I had the great pleasure of finding
myself in the Presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. {{p298}} A cablegram
from Marseilles announced the departure of Mrs. Fraser
and her approaching arrival in Port Sa‘íd. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
sent a telegram to Aḥmad Yazdí to receive and direct her
to Ramleh. Another telegram from America inquired
about his health. Letters from Boston and Washington,
as well as from Germany contributed to his happiness.
The Bahá’í Cause in Germany is making splendid headway,
and believers, enthused by the presence and example
of the Master, have arisen to spread the Movement with
a determination and strength never equaled before. As he
walked back and forth, while I was reading the letter
from Germany, he smiled and was much elated, saying:
You see, you see! He wished the believers to spread the
Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. If they do this, divine Confirmations
shall encircle them from all directions.   

The Cause, he said, has thrown a universal reverberation
through the pillars of the earth, and the divine Power
of Bahá’u’lláh shall encircle the globe. Rest thou assured
of this.   

###  3. Photographs Received from America and Germany
Distributed among the Persian Bahá’ís 

This week I received five packages of photographs of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá from Mr. and Mrs. Killius of Spokane,
Wash., which were to be divided between Mírzá Maḥmúd
and myself. After making the division in equal
parts I have distributed a number of them among the
students and pilgrims. They are all made very happy
by these presents. {{p299}} I also received some photographs from
Consul Schwartz of Stuttgart which are already given
away to many believers. In this way, the Western friends
can impart the greatest joy to the hearts of their Eastern
brothers.   

[Editor’s note: The book goes from No. 3 to No. 5; No. 4 is missing.]   

###  5. The Silence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Is Eloquent 

In the evening the Master came in while the students
were sitting on the veranda. As he entered they all arose.
Before sitting he told us that this was a good gathering,
a luminous gathering. He sat for ten minutes, but he did
not speak one word. Silence, calm and eloquent, pervaded
the whole atmosphere, and when he left we were
quite as contented and happy as if he had given us an
address.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 10, 1913. 

###  1. Good News Received from America and Europe 

I received a number of letters from the United States.
Chicago, Spokane, New York, San Francisco and Washington
were represented. I am sure that all the good
news will make the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá very happy. I
had also letters from Budapest and Stuttgart, London
and Paris. In London the believers are already laying
plans for the promotion of the Cause during the winter.
The American friends, I have no doubt, will likewise
carry away the wreath of triumph, and shall guide many
souls into the green valley of Divine Faith.   

###  2. A few Arabian Proverbs 

Here I would like to quote a few proverbs which the
Arabs use in their conversation. {{p300}} The Arabs are generally
very lively and dramatic. Their talk is enriched with
numberless epigrams, and is endowed with a wonderful
power of expression and poetic fancy. They are simple,
yet winsome, graceful and most chivalrous.   

>  “Make neither your friendship a pretense, nor your
hatred a menace.” 

>  “Don’t ask a man about his origin; you can read it in
his face.” 

>  “Patriotism is from faith.” 

>  “The boy is his mother’s double.” 

>  “Avarice destroys what the avaricious gather.” 

>  “A ruler without justice is no better than a river without
water.” 

>  “A man is often an enemy of things concerning which
he is ill-informed.” 

>  “There is no honor like the possession of a good character.” 

>  “Disdain not a kind action, be it but to give water to
one who is not thirsty.” 

>  “Knowledge without practice is like a bow without a
string.” 

>  “No pious act is more beloved by God than the telling
of the truth.” 

>  “Without Hope, no mother would nurse her child, nor
would any peasant plant his land.” 

>  “The young who revere the aged will receive reverence
themselves when they are old.” 

>  “The next best thing to belief in God, is sympathy with
people.” 

>  “A true believer is not content while his neighbor is
hungry.” 

>  “There are men who are keys to the good, and locks
to the evil.” 

>  “Avoid vain hopes — contentment is prosperity.” 

>  “Wisdom lifts a slave unto the dignity of princes.” 

>  “Hearts, like bodies, become tired and should have
recreation.” 

>  A wise enemy is less harmful than a foolish friend.” 

>  “Man is not to be valued by the robes he wears, but
by the character he shows.” 

>  “If you censure your friends for every fault they
commit, there will come a time when you will have no
friend to censure.” 

The beautiful spirit of the hospitality of the Arabs is
often illustrated by the apt inscription of welcome engraved
above the gates of their homes; {{p301}} for example:   

>  “Welcome to him of whose approach I am all unworthy.” 

>  “Welcome to the voice announcing joy after lonely
melancholy.” 

>  “Good tidings thine; off with the robes of sadness;
for know, thou art accepted, and I myself will take upon
me whatsoever grieves thee.” 

###  3. A Prayer by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for Detachment 

I will here translate a prayer from the pen of the
Master.   

“He is El Abhá!   

“O Thou kind, Incomparable God!   

“Familiarize these hearts with Thy Mysteries and detach
them from friends and strangers. {{p302}} Suffer them to
drink from the cup of the Wine of the Morn of Eternity
and intoxicate them with the Goblet of Everlasting
Felicity. These servants long and yearn for Thee and
these lovers are enamored and attached to Thee. They
are dwellers in Thy Mount and attracted with the Beauty
of Thy Face. They are the gazelles of Thy flock wandering
in the wilderness of separation and scattered in the
valley of regret. Send Thou to them the Messenger of
Providence and cause to descend upon them the angel of
guidance: — so that the fragrance may waft from Thine
Abode to their nostrils and an effulgence from Thy Face
may illumine the hearts of these servants; the impenetrable
darkness be changed into light and the thorny place
transformed into a rose-garden. Verily Thou art the
Powerful, the Seeing and the Hearing.”   

In the evening Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl came and all the students
gathered around him and he spoke to them about the
early events of the Cause.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 11, 1913. 

###  1. How the Persian Students Lived Together 

Tomorrow our band of earnest students will depart,
and everything will again be quiet for a few days before
the second party arrives. The past days my room was a
busy center; here a number of them were speaking, there
some were writing letters. From morning till late in the
evening they were constantly coming and going. {{p303}} Many
of them were anxious to possess the Master’s talks in
America which I gave to them and of which in turn they
made copies forwarding them to their homes. They were
not only polite and courteous toward us, but also toward
each other. They exercised the utmost kindness and consideration
and did not lack the sense of true friendship
and fellow-feeling. Like members of one family they
inspired confidence and emulation. They were full of
hope and each a true optimist. I can hardly remember a
more united, a more congenial or a more devoted band
of young men. Each one has set in his heart the accomplishment
of a certain object, and is intent on carrying
it out. The photographs of the Master sent by Mrs. A.
B. Killius of Spokane, arrived in due time, and many of
them were made happy by receiving this gift. In every
one of his speeches, the Master has expressed to them
his satisfaction and pleasure, because they are studying
with zeal and their lives have been pure and uncontaminated.
They are wonderful examples of the spirit of
modern Persia.   

Today ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to see them both in the morning
and evening and each time he delivered a very eloquent
and effective address, which I will share with you
soon.   

###  2. An Important Tablet Revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for
China 

I will now give the translation of a very significant
Tablet revealed for a learned gentleman in China. It may
be taken safely that this is the first important Tablet
which has been sent to the Chinese Republic. I would
like to see it translated into the Japanese language and
also into Chinese. {{p304}} Once translated into these two languages
it will be well if it were printed in a small pamphlet
with a short historical sketch of the Bahá’í Cause, and distributed.   

“He is God!   

“O THOU WOOER OF TRUTH WHO ART ATHIRST FOR
REALITY!   

“Your letter was received. Its contents was evidence
to the fact that from the horizon of consciousness the
refulgent light has become manifest. It is hoped that
after the appearance of the dawn, the brilliant sun may
rise so gloriously as to cast its splendors upon all regions.   

“It is a fact well-known to your honor that the world
of existence is in need of an educator and instructor. The
educators are of two kinds. The educators of the world
of nature, and thee educators of the world of reality. If
you leave the earth in its natural condition, it will become
a jungle and a thorny place; but once it is entrusted to the
hands of a skilled and kind gardener, the jungle will be
changed into an orchard, and the thorny patch transformed
into a rose-garden. Consequently, it has become
evident that the world of nature is in need of training.
Moreover, reflect carefully, for should humankind be
deprived of the graces of culture and instruction, it would
become a poisonous body; because the savage tribes have
not acquired any of the separative distinctions which differentiate
man from beast. For example: what is the
difference between the African negro and the American
negro? The former has not yet adorned himself with
the ideals of culture while the latter has become intelligent,
sagacious and civilized. During my journey throughout
America, at the time when I was in Washington and elsewhere,
I delivered detailed addresses in the universities,
churches, conventions and meetings of the negroes, and
found their audiences composed of most intelligent persons
who could grasp the subjects under discussion as well as
any other audiences of civilized and intelligent Westerners.
Thus a great chasm exists between these two
communities of negroes; {{p305}} one in the lowest depth of ignorance;
another rising toward the pinnacle of civilization
and freedom. Then it is plain that education is the distinguishing
mark. Undoubtedly, culture or instruction
is the cause of the glory of the one, while the lack of
education is the means of the degradation of the other.   

“Hence it is proven that education is the concomitant
necessity of the world of modern civilization.   

“Furthermore: Civilization is of two kinds. The
civilization of the world of nature and the Civilization of
the world of reality which belongs to the realm of morality.
As long as the influence of these two types of civilization
does not appear fully in the body politic, complete
success and prosperity will not be obtained. Consider
that the tent of material civilization is pitched in the
European world; yet notwithstanding this how dark it
is! The thoughts of all men converge upon the law of
the ‘Survival of the fittest’ and the ideals of all the inhabitants
revolve around the doctrine of the ‘Struggle for
existence.’ The extravagant expenditures on armaments
are daily increasing at a terrible rate, and the staggering
expenses of the financial budget to support the preparations
of the military storehouses, have brought the nations
to the brink of bankruptcy. Civilized mankind is in a
state of civil insurrection and under a too heavy burden;
they are struggling, with wonder and astonishment, to
free themselves. All this is because the civilization of
morality, spirituality and attraction with the Fragrances
of God is entirely lost sight of.   

“In short: Just as the Instructor and the Teacher are
necessary in the material world; so in the Ideal realm, i.e.:
the Kingdom of spirit and consciousness, ethics and
morality, infinite virtues and the perfections of humankind
and salvation in both worlds — there must needs be
an Educator and Teacher. {{p306}} The founders of natural
civilization are the philosophers of the earth, and the
Teachers of the Ideal civilization are the Holy Divine
Manifestations. Therefore if the human world is deprived
of the training of the natural and ideal teacher,
unquestionable it will fall headlong into the lowest
stratum of the animal kingdom. Natural civilization is
like unto a glass; divine civilization is like unto the light.
Material civilization is similar to the body, Divine Civilization
is the spirit. The lamp is in need of the light and
the body is only quickened through the spirit. Read the
work of Galen, the famous Greek Philosopher, which
he has written on the progress of the civilization of the
world of humanity. He says: ‘Religious beliefs are the
greatest means of impelling upward the world of civilization
and humanity. As an example to this: — We observe
that a number of people contemporaneous with us are
known as Christians. Inasmuch as they are firmly rooted
and well-established in their beliefs, the common people
of this sect are as true philosophers, are adorned with such
ethics and manners that the greatest philosophers attain
to them only after many years of study, troubles, hardships
and discipline. The simple folk of this community
are characterized with the infinite virtues and excellences
of the world of humanity.’ Hence it is established that
mankind is in need of an Ideal, Universal Instructor, in
order to unify under the shade of one Word the various
nationalities, causing antagonistic communities to drink
from one fountain; changing enmity and hatred into
amity and love, and transforming strife and war into
peace and salvation. {{p307}} In this manner His Holiness
Muḥammad — upon him be peace and greeting — conciliated
the various contending warlike, barbaric tribes and
nomads of Arabia, and ushered them into the shade of
the Tent of agreement, upraised a lofty banner in the
world of physical and spiritual sciences, and caused them
to attain to the highest station of Everlasting Glory.
Likewise, His Holiness Christ — upon Him be peace — gathered around one spring of Unity, the inimical, the
quarrelsome and the warring nations of Greeks, Romans,
Syrians, Chaldeans, Assyrians and Egyptians who exercised
toward each other the utmost rancor and contempt.
He established amongst them the ideal band of communications.   

“The above instances irrevocably demonstrate that the
world of humanity is in need of Universal Teachers and
Instructors, and that these are the holy, divine Manifestations.
If certain souls pretend to be of the elect and in no
need of education, it is similar to a pretension put forth by
private soldiers that they are skilled and efficient, and do
not require the instruction of the general. It is evident
that such statements are baseless. All the individuals of
the army, whether privates or officers, are in need of the
supervision of the commander-in-chief, who is the general
instructor.   

“This is enough and sufficient for those who have hearing
ears and to this God bears testimony!   

(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 12, 1913. 

###  1. Departure of the Persian Students 

Separation from the friends of God is a difficult thing.
Although by this time we are more or less used to it,
having already traveled so much, seen so many countries
and associated with so many Bahá’ís — still we feel keenly
when we meet and grow to love a number of the Bahá’ís — then suddenly they depart and in al probability, never
will we meet again. However, in this separation, there
is one consolation and that is: — these friends go out into
the world after attaining to the meeting of the Beloved, to
teach the Cause of human brotherhood and to equip themselves
to become more useful instruments. Thus in a
spiritual sense there is no separation between those Bahá’ís
who are truly devoted to the Cause of God and are striving
in the path of Reality. Consequently, from an external
standpoint, we were all sad, when we saw the body
of students leave the house for the station. The Master
received them in the afternoon and delivered to them his
last word of advice and exhortation.   

###  2. Russian Court Meets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Talks on the
Two Aspects of Reincarnation 

The Master had sent for me to go to the hotel and
translate. A prominent Russian Count who understands
English and French was calling on him. In a moment
I was there, and soon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá plunged into a deep
and most interesting discussion about the two aspects of
reincarnation, the particular and universal, the return of
generic and specific ideas, and a presentation of the logical
proofs concerning the existence of a Divine, Supreme
Power, animating and energizing all creation. The Count
seemed greatly interested, and was going to ask more
questions, when the Secretary of the brother of the Khedive
was announced. {{p309}} Thus he postponed his questions
for a later meeting and departed with satisfaction and
pleasure.   

###  3. Strive That Love May Increase Day by Day 

“Strive ye as much as ye can; — so that love and amity
may increase day by day amongst the believers of God;
all of you can help each other and be ever ready to sacrifice
your lives for one another. This is the quality of the
people of Bahá.”   

###  4. Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Author of “Modern
Social Religion.” 

The flowing is a Tablet to Mr. Horace Holley, the
author of the Bahá’í work called “Modern Social Religion:”   

“He is God!   

“O THOU SON OF THE KINGDOM!   

“A copy of the book written by thee and forwarded
to this spot was received. The friends re engaged in
reading it. They praise and commend your book most
highly and appreciatively. God willing, it will be translated
and I likewise will read it. Thank God that thou
art confirmed and assisted; thy aim is to render service
to the Kingdom of Abhá and thy object the promotion
of the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. Although the glory
and greatness of this service is not known at the present
it will in future ages, assume most great importance and
attract the attention of scholars. {{p310}} Therefore strive more
and more as far as thou canst in this service, so that it
may become the Cause of thy everlasting glory; in the
Kingdom of Abhá thou mayest be enkindled like unto a
candle and in the horizon of majesty thou mayst shine
like unto a star. Upon thee be Bahá’u’lláh.   

(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

###  5. Pure Intention Is the Magnet of Heavenly Assistance 

In another Tablet he says to Mrs. Killius:   

“O thou who art attracted by the Love of God! Thy
letter was like a mirror in which were reflected the pictures
of Divine Confirmations. Thou hast a heart which
is turned toward the Kingdom of Abhá, a spirit rejoiced
by the Glad-tidings of God and eyes illumined by beholding
the Lights of God. Your aim is to render service
to the world of Reality. Pure intention is the magnet of
heavenly assistance and the only means whereby to attract
a great power.”   

To another person whose house had been burned down
he reveals:   

###  6. “Strive to Quicken Dead Souls” 

“If thy earthly house is destroyed, be thou not sad!
May the Palace of the Kingdom be upbuilt! O thou bird
of reality! If thy terrestrial nest is ruined, be thou not
unhappy, a heavenly nest is destined for thee. His Holiness
Christ, the Holy Manifestations and the apostles
possessed no nest whatsoever in this mortal word, but
in the Universe of God a glorious Palace. It is hoped
that through the Divine Bestowals, on a lofty station, in
the Universe of God, a radiant palace may become prepared
for thee. {{p311}} Consider that the palaces of former kings
from the day of Adam to the present age are ravaged by
the relentless hand of time, while the towering Palace of
the believers of God are built throughout Eternity and are
never subject to destruction. Reflect carefully and thou
shalt observe that all the buildings are uptorn, but the
foundation of the apostles of Christ is becoming firmer
and loftier every day. It is my hope that thou shalt likewise
lay the basis of such a lofty palace. The foundation
of this Palace is the Call of the Kingdom of God; its
galleries are the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh; its decorations
the virtues of the world of humanity and its radiant lamps
the lights of the Divine Kingdom. Therefore strive as
much as thou canst to quicken dead souls, to guide erring
ones, to cause to drink those who are thirsty and to invite
those who are hungry to sit around the heavenly Table
and partake of the Divine Foot.”

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 13, 1913. 

###  1. From Ramleh a Mysterious Power Is Silently Quickening
the World 

Ramleh is honored with the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
>From this quiet summer resort of Egypt the mysterious
power of God is felt in the uttermost corners of the world.
Men, women and children belonging to all nationalities
and religions are turning their attention to this spot.
Here lives and moves the God-man amongst the people,
as lived and moved Jesus over 1900 years ago along the
shore of Galilee. His munificence and generosity embrace
the world of humanity. {{p312}} His love is all-inclusive and
the fountain of his sympathy flows without any interruption.
With their burdens, sorrows and sufferings,
the children of men come to him. With willingness and
pleasure he shoulders their burdens; he cheers the despondent
heart; he inspires the downcast; he strengthens
the weak; he helps the poor and sows the seeds of wisdom
in the garden of their minds. With fortitude he stands
before the world and proclaims the coming of the kingdom
of God. Those who are endowed with divine perception
can easily realize that the spirit of God is moving
over the world, the doors of the kingdom are open, and
the Graces and Bounties of the Lord of Hosts are manifest.
Thus awakened they arise to glorify their Lord
and to summon mankind to the Banquet of Eternal Life
and Everlasting Felicity.   

###  2. Story of the German consul in Haifa and how He
Became the Victim of Bravo 

This morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá accompanied by Shoghi
Effendi came to our house and sat for about half an hour.
Throughout his talk he laughed, giving us much happiness.
He told us the story of a German Consul in Haifa,
illustrating how certain people come to a sad end because
they enjoy and believe the flattery of sycophants.   

In Haifa there was at one time a German Consul who
became ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s friend. He used to call on him
often, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá returned his visits. At one time
he disappeared for a whole month. Suddenly, one day
he entered ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s room. He had a stick in his
hand and was lame. “Oh, sir, how is it that you have not
inquired about my health during the past month?” — “Why, friend, what has happened to thee?” “Yes,” he
pitifully answered, “I am the victim of ‘Bravo.’ Let me
tell you how it happened. {{p313}} The German colony had prepared
a ball, a ball, to which I was bidden. The governor, the
judges and the officials of Haifa were likewise invited.
When the dancing was over, they had a jumping contest.
One by one they started to jump, but in a clumsy manner.
I saw that none of them had learned the secret of jumping
a long distance, but I had learned it in boyhood, going to
gymnasium in Germany. When the last one failed to
reach the mark, I volunteered as a candidate. All eyes
were on me now. My first attempt was so successful that
it elicited the hearty ‘Bravo’ of the governor. In my
heart I was pleased and thought I would try again, and
go beyond the first limit. I went back and back, then
jumped forward, and when I landed on the other side, a
tumultuous applause was raised from the governor and the
officials. ‘Bravo, bravo,’ rang in my ears. By this time,
I was puffed up with pride and became blind to my own
limitations. ‘Now I will show them,’ I said to myself,
‘what real jumping is,’ and with this determination I
started the third time. I wanted to go further, much
further than the first and second time, and so, when I
came down upon the earth with a great crash, I felt a
most excruciating pain in my right foot. My leg was
broken. I became unconscious, and when I opened my
eyes, I found myself in bed. For the last thirty days I
have suffered much. Thus you see now, how I became
the victim of the ‘Bravos’ of the governor.” There are
many people in this world who will go to the limit of
doing anything, even in attacking the purity and the
motives of their friends just to gain a temporary applause
and Bravo without thinking of the ruinous effect
of such a thing upon themselves in the future, and the
loss of public confidence.   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Dictates Tablets for Russia 

The Master had received many letters from the East
and America. {{p314}} He wondered to which direction he should
turn his attention   

Seeing a package of letters in my hand, he laughingly
asked: Is this the work I had prepared for him? How
many hours did I want? It seemed to him that there
was no end to my requests.   

In the afternoon he dictated Tablets in the Garden to
Shoghi Effendi for a long list of believers in Baku,
Russia. Tea was served while he revealed the heavenly
words. He also entertained the Arabic professor of the
American College in Beirut. He spoke with him about
the unification of religions and the principles of the
Bahá’í movement. The professor went away with a new
light in his heart.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 14, 1913. 

###  1. The law of Universal Love and the Bahá’ís 

In the garden of the heart plant only the flowers of
Love. The fragrance of the hyacinths of Love, the influence
of the divine Love, the efficacy of the spiritual
Love must constitute the foundation of the life of every
Bahá’í. You shall know the tree by its fruit. You shall
recognize a real soul by the quality of Love he manifests.
With Love in our hearts we are enabled to benefit humanity.
Love being the magnet, its possessor is enabled
to attract the hearts to the Kingdom of Peace. {{p315}} True love
never changes, and has no similitude or shadow of turning.
Love is the basis of human sympathy, and sympathy
prompts us to be kind and compassionate to all those who
are in sad circumstances. With Love the enemy is
changed into a friend, the cheerless is comforted, the
weary traveler is lodged, the hungry fed, the naked
clothed, the destitute made rich, the weak reinforced, the
hopeless made hopeful, and the barren life made to
blossom like unto a rose. Love is the great panacea for
the healing of all social, political and economic evils.
Love is the Holy Fire enkindled in the hearts by the hand
of God. The only Love that is all-enduring is the Love of
mankind. Let the power of this Love take possession of
our beings. Let the sea of this Love flow toward the
countries of our hearts. Let the rays of this Love illumine
the dark recesses of our minds. Let the sun of this Love
flood the regions of our souls. Those who have experienced
this Love will never become despondent; with shining
faces and smiling lips they shall march through the
storm of difficulty, scale the impassable mountains of
trials and reach the goal with added zeal, increased energy,
supreme faith and unfaltering courage. This Love exalts
one’s Ideals, purifies one’s motives and glorifies one’s
thought.   

The Bahá’ís are the servants at the Court of this Love;
they adore and pay tribute to this king. Love, only Love,
makes them invulnerable. With this weapon they gain
victories over the cities of the hearts. With this torch
they dispel the gloom. With this medicine they heal the
sick and with this water they allay the thirsty ones. Out
of this book they have learned the Mysteries of God; from
this spring they have quaffed the wine of Knowledge,
toward this exalted height they are soaring, and in this
illimitable ocean they are submerged. {{p316}} They are the followers
of the Lord of Truth, whose words, actions and
ideals are spelled in letters of Love — Love for the world
of humanity. Their watchword is Love. Their calling
is Love and their avocation is Love. They eat Love, they
drink Love, they are clothed in Love and have their existence
through Love. They have known the source of
Love, and Love has made them free. They love God
and they love mankind. With this omnipotent power
they have arisen to serve the world. In all their transactions
and dealings Love is their Instructor. They love
to live a life of simplicity, prayerfulness, helpfulness and
service. For them there is no more sorrow or hate. Life
is an Elysian garden of joy and happiness where men may
live together lovingly. Love is peace, peace is contentment,
contentment is light.   

###  2. Tablets for German Bahá’ís 

This morning I was called into the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
. He has taught us what Love is, and how we should
gain more capacity to become the custodians of Love.
He called <u>Kh</u>usraw to bring him a small cup of coffee, and
when it was served, with a twinkle in his eye, he said:   

“Who says that Mírzá Aḥmad does not drink a cup
of coffee? <u>Kh</u>usraw, bring him one!”   

Then he dictated several wonderful Tablets for the
German believers. He was especially pleased with the
letter of Miss A. Knoblock, and with her splendid work
in several German cities. He ordered the translation of
her letter to be sent to all parts of the Orient. He started
to dictate a Tablet for her: “O thou herald of the Kingdom
of Abhá” — then he turned to me saying:   

“Truly she is a herald of the cause of God. She has
won this title by her noble work in guiding the souls.”   

Then he continued. At this time Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar was
announced and later on Ḥájí Níáz.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 15, 1913. 

###  1. A Busy Day for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

We did not see the Master today. In the morning he
was busy reading his letters; in the afternoon he dictated
Tablets for the believers of Persia; in the evening he gave
an interview to two correspondents of Arabic Dailies in
Cairo. We were standing near the door of the Victoria
Hotel, expecting him to come out when the interview was
ended. About 10:30 P.M. we saw him descending the
stairs. He was feeling well, but a little tired.   

###  2. The Story of the King and the Thorn-picker 

If you would like to hear the story of the king and the
thorn-picker as related to me by Mírzá Jalál Síná, I will
be glad to share it with you:   

Once upon a time the king of the country of the North
went hunting. While he was chasing a deer, he forgot
all about his retinue and royal tent, and charged his steed
through glen and dale; the deer ever evading him by leading
him on. Suddenly the king realized that he was far
away from his servants, the midday sun poured its hot
rays down upon his head. He looked around, and to his
amazement found himself in a vast desert full of thorns
and briars. Then in the far distance he spied, with his
eyeglass, an old man gathering thorns. The old man
startled, looked up. “Who art thou?” the king asked.
“I am a thorn-picker and maintain my large family by
selling thorns in the city.” “How many times a week
dost thou come here?” {{p318}} “Oh, I come every day. If I
miss one day, my people will go hungry.” “But surely
thou art not equal to this hard work.” “What else can
I do?” “Come, my brother,” the king said, as he extended
his hand to him. “If thou dost listen to me and
obey all my orders, I will make thee the richest man in the
world. I will teach thee the secret of the Philosopher’s
Stone which transmutes the baser metals into gold.”
“Very well, I will follow and obey thee under all circumstances.”
“But thou must first realize that the road is
full of temptations. Thou must look neither to thy right
nor to thy left, listen to me and renouncing all things,
ever follow me.” “Yea, yea, I will do anything thou
dost command me.” “Very well, then, come; I am willing
to give thee a trial.” The thorn-picker, throwing
away his stiletto with which he used to cut the thorns,
started to follow the king.   

For one hour they walked till they reached a desert
which was shining under the rays of the sun. The old
man asked the king: “Why is this soil so brilliant?”
“The ground of this desert is of silver.” “Oh, oh, can
I not fill my pockets with it?” he asked, all excitement.
“Did I not tell thee that thou wilt encounter temptations
in the path?” The old man, being thus rebuked
for his apparent forgetfulness, became silent and said
nothing, but in his heart he coveted such free, abundant
wealth. In order to keep his mind away from his secret
thoughts, the king tried to entertain him with varied conversation
until they had passed by this plain, and entered
another which was of a dazzling yellow color. “What is
this?” the thorn-picker asked, while blinking his eyes.
“The soil of this plain is of gold.” “Gold, gold, my goodness!
There is so much gold scattered here, and I am
so utterly, so miserably poor; and my family always half-starved.”
Half bent, inclined by an uncontrollable desire,
he was going to grab a nugget, when the king took
him by the hand: {{p319}} “Come, come, my brother, I shall make
thee so rich that thou wilt not deign to look at a mountain
of gold.” “Well, I don’t know how! Here I see so
much gold, a pocketful of which will make me rich beyond
my fondest dreams.” “Don’t listen to the suggestions of
thy heart. This desert of gold is not to be compared to
the treasures which lie before thee.” “I will wait and
see.”   

At last they crossed the desert, but the old man was
moody, his eyes wandering to the right and to the left,
looking at the immense amount of gold dust scattered
over the plain. Finally they entered another desert.
Here their eyes were almost blinded by the dazzling brilliancy
everywhere. “What is this plain made of? Please
tell me at once,” the old man asked excitedly. “I have
never seen anything like it in all my life.” “Oh,” the
king answered calmly: “Nothing especially valuable. This
is the diamond plain.” “Diamond!” His eyes were
ready to fall from their sockets. “I have heard that it
is the most precious gem in the world. Surely you will
permit me to fill at least one of my pockets with these
precious stones. Just think how one of them will make
me quite independent!” “No, brother, thou must not act
like a child. On this pilgrimage thou canst not carry
anything with thee. Like a bird thou must be free. Thou
must not soil thy wings with water and clay, otherwise
thou wilt not be able to soar and reach the height.” With
much persuasion, the old man was at last prevented from
loading himself with diamonds, and by and by they were
out of this plain too. Now it was nearly sunset, when lo,
on the Western horizon they saw a wonderful body of
water shimmering under the last rays of the sun. the
king pointed it out to the old man with an exultant cry: —
“Look, dost thou see the ocean lying before us? {{p320}} This
is the sea of the ‘Philosopher’s Stone’, one drop of which
will transmute all the baser metals into the purest gold.”
The old man was, however, extremely tired by this time,
and as he was thinking in an absent-minded way how to
answer the king, he saw another thorn-picker, who was a
friend of his, appearing on the scene. “What does thou
do here?” he asked. “Today,” he said, “several members
of our guild went on a strike, so a load of thorns is
fetching a high price in the city. Come along with me.
We two, all our lives, have been non-union members, and
for the next two or three days, before the strike is settled,
we can make a nice profit by supplying the citizens with
the necessary fuel.” The old thorn-picker got very much
excited over this unexpected news, and forgetting the
king, the ocean of the Philosopher’s Stone and the inexhaustible
fortune awaiting him, turned back. The king,
pitying their ignorance, cried out after them, promising
that he would make both rich beyond their dreams. The
younger man hesitated for a moment, but the old man
would not listen. “He has fooled me all day, and now
he is going to make another fool out of you. Let us run
quickly before he persuades us again to obey and follow
him.”   

For two days they gathered several loads of thorns,
hoping that they would sell them at their own price and
become independent and rich. But when they entered the
city, they learned to their utter dismay that the price was
even lower than its current standard, because there was
no strike at all amongst the thorn-pickers, and the information
given to the younger man was based on hearsay.
Then the old man remembered the king, the plains of silver,
gold and diamonds, and the ocean of the philosopher’s
stone. Wildly he ran out of the city, searched and
searched all the neighboring plains, but he could find no
trace of the king. {{p321}} Everything had disappeared like magic.
“Why did I listen to another man? Why did I not obey
the king? Why did I deprive myself of such a heavenly
treasury?” Thus he was rebuking himself as he continued
his search, ever hoping to find the king.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 16, 1913. 

###  1. Arrival of Pilgrims and Other Incidents 

This morning I could see the Master only for a few
minutes and presented to him a number of letters just
translated. We did not see him any more before sunset.
At that hour he passed by our home going to Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl’s apartment, where the Arab believers gather weekly
to hear him speak. A number of Persians were also
there. He sent for Mírzá Maḥmúd and told him that
there were some pilgrims who would arrive at 7:30 P.M.
from Port Sa‘íd, and that we should go to the station
to welcome them. We walked to Sidi Jaber and when the
train rolled into the station, we were glad to receive two
young Persians, one from Russia, another from Beirut,
and Mrs. Stannard from Haifa. She has spent a pleasant
summer on Mount Carmel and is going to stay at Ramleh,
as long as the Master continues to live here. We conducted
her to the Victoria Hotel. Miss Hiscock also has
left her Hotel and is now at this one. {{p322}} I hear that Mrs.
Getsinger will go to ‘Akká and Haifa to visit the holy
Tombs of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb before starting on her
journey to India.   

###  2. Translation of a Tablet, Giving the Keynote of the
Bahá’í Movement 

“He is God!   

“O YE FRIENDS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ! In this Divine
Dispensation and lordly Cycle the fundamental principle
and the supreme object is the establishment of the oneness
of the world of humanity; so that through this oneness
and agreement all wars and contentions will be wiped
away from amongst mankind and the Beloved of Union
appear in the Assemblage of the world.   

“The promulgators of this Union must be the believers
of God, — so that through the merciful power they may
dispel from the horizon of the world the darkness of
strangeness and the Adored One of Unity may unveil
her sweet and heart-captivating Countenance. If the
least ill-feeling exists amongst the friends themselves,
how, then, can this great matter be realized? Therefore,
everyone of the believers must strive valiantly with
heart and soul; so that not the smallest speck of dust may
sit upon the mirror of fundamental Unity; Love should
increase day unto day, and the qualities of good-fellowship,
intimacy, friendship and mutual kindness be clothed
with resplendent realities amongst the believers.   

“O God, O God, I lay my forehead and place my face
upon the dust of humility and submission — looking up
toward the kingdom of Mystery and beg of Thee with a
contrite, supplicating, entreating, humble, submissive,
broken and pain-encircled heart, from the Threshold of
Thy Holiness — in the world of Lights — to render asunder
the veils of Pluralities, and with manifest signs reveal the
Beauty of Fundamental Unity in the hearts.   

“O Lord! {{p323}} Make Thy believers the waves of the sea
of Thy Oneness, the Breezes of the rose-garden of Thy
singleness, the stars of the heaven of amity and good-fellowship
and the pearls of the ocean of Love and Guidance; — so that they may drink from one fountain, breathe
in one air, be illumined by one light, turn entirely their
faces toward the world of renunciation and the Center
of inspiration.   

“Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Beloved, the Glorious
and the Most High!   

(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

###  3. Give Hearing to the Deaf, Sight to the Blind and
Speech to the Dumb 

“O thou sign of Guidance! Thank God that thou hast
advanced from the region of darkness toward the center
of Lights and after crossing the desert of mirage, hast
reached the sweet, cool and salubrious springs. The rays
of Guidance thou hast beheld in the horizon of Unity,
and in the Valley of safety, thou didst hear the soul-refreshing
Call of God from the Blessed Tree. The
honey of the Love of God thou didst taste, and hast become
intoxicated with the Wine of the Knowledge of
God.   

“Now is the time when thou mayst become the associate
of the known and unknown and at every moment raise
the cry of Ya-Bahá-El Abhá. Unloose thy tongue in the
most great Guidance; give hearing to the deaf, sight to
the blind and speech to the dumb. Bestow exhilaration
and rejoicing upon the lukewarm, and happiness and
joy upon the despondent. Confer intelligence upon the
heedless, awake the sleepy ones, cause to drink those
who are thirsty, guide the erring ones, make confident
those who are deprived, and reinforce the weak. Verily
thy Lord will assist thee and help thee; {{p324}} will inspire thee
with the breaths of the Holy Spirit and cause thee to
utter His proofs and arguments with great penetration
and conviction.”

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 17, 1913. 

###  1. The Spiritual Palace of International Brotherhood Is
Being Built by the Peacemakers 

All the palaces that are built are subject to destruction,
save only the Palace of Love which is protected. So far
as Love is the Ruler of hearts, there is no difficulty, but
when it is replaced by indifference, and the fire is extinguished.
In order to remove the possibility of estrangement,
we must look to the higher principles of the
spiritual life. For life indeed is sterile, unless it produces
the fruits of love, a Love which breaks through all the
walls of national and racial prejudices, and enters upon
the plane of universal brotherhood. The spiritual Palace,
the foundation of which is the Love of God is never laid
waste.   

The Palace of the Bahá’í Cause is firm; because its
architect is Bahá’u’lláh, its builder is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, its
masons are the companions of God, its laborers are the
friends of God, its foundation the Word of God; {{p325}} its
cement the Law of God, its water the blood of the martyrs,
its materials and principles of absolute Reality, its
rooms the religions of God, its light the sun of righteousness,
its decorations the virtues of the world of humanity,
its imperishable flowers the glorious attributes of
Divinity and its dwellers the people of Truth.   

Men and women from East and West, North and
South are daily working on the construction of this
Palace. With noble self-sacrifice, with unparalleled enthusiasm,
with confident self-reliance, they are continually
adding new partitions to this heavenly Palace. They
do not rest for one moment. For them spiritual treasures
are destined and inestimable bounties are provided.
Are they not joint-partners in the building of the Palace
of International Peace and arbitration, the edifice of the
equality of human rights and the structure of the economic
adjustment of all the inescapable problems of this
modern era? We are assured by the Divine Architect
that the volcanic events of the times and the corroding
effect of the coming ages, shall not leave their impressions
upon this spiritual Palace.   

###  2. “Christian Commonwealth” and Bahá’í Articles 

Today ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had a slight fever; notwithstanding
this he wrote many Tablets for the believers of ‘Akká
with his own hand. He received the newly arrived believer,
Mírzá Siyyid Ḥusayn, a fine young man, a graduate
from the college of Beirut, and the son of the sister
of the Master. Of course, he lives in His house. The
rest of the students are expected to arrive tomorrow.
In the afternoon the Master passed by and went to the
garden. He stayed there for more than an hour, telling
several stories to Ḥájí Níáz who was in his presence.
On his return we caught just a glimpse of him.   

The Christian Commonwealth is publishing weekly
articles and these are regularly translated into Persian
and circulated in the Orient for the benefit of our Eastern
friends, especially the August number which contained
an article on the Prison Experiences of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
The Master has often expressed the wish that the friends
should serve the Cause by subscribing to this paper. {{p326}} The
other day a Tablet was revealed for the editor which I
transcribe here; so that it may encourage the Bahá’ís to
increase their subscriptions. They can do so through
Mr. Joseph H. Hannen; because he is its Bahá’í correspondent.
One of the latest copies will contain the Master’s
article on Universal Peace.   

###  3. Tablet to the Editor of the “Christian Commonwealth”

“He is God!   

“O THOU KIND, BELOVED FRIEND!   

“The copies of your peerless paper which are in reality
the proofs of your high ideals, the exaltation of your
aims and the principles of the prosperity of the world
aims and the principles of the prosperity of the world
paper of yours which is like unto a clear, transparent
of humanity — were received. Truly I say, this unique
mirror, reveal the images of Reality. It is the reflection
of Truths which mirror forth through the pages of this
paper. All the Bahá’ís are grateful and thankful to you
on account of your praiseworthy intentions. The significance
of these articles is not realized at the present
time, but in the future they will gain such importance that
every copy containing an article on the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh
will be framed, preserved and hung in the most
honored place, and their contents quoted by people of
culture. Therefore, rest thou assured that thou art sowing
pure seeds in pure ground. {{p327}} Ere long they will grow
and develop and many harvests will be gathered.   

“Upon thee be greeting and praise,   

(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

###  4. The Sojourn in Ramleh Has Been Fruitful 

So far as I can judge at the present, our stay in Ramleh
is coming to a close, though the next place to be honored
by the presence of the Beloved is not definitely
known. I hear talk about his going to Haifa. However,
he will be here at least one month more. Our summer
was altogether very delightful. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
a source of great joy and strength to the hearts of many
believers who made the pilgrimage from all corners of
the Orient to see him and to receive his spiritual instructions.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 18, 1913. 

###  1. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Writes to the Believers in Russia 

This morning the Master dressed in his beautiful soft
cream-colored robe, entered our house. Mírzá ‘Alí Akber
handed him a few letters from Russia. He read them
without delay and asked Mírzá Munír to bring paper,
ink and pen. He dictated answers to each, and through
them you can see how he adapts himself to the individual
needs and the spiritual capacity of every person, and out
of his abundant treasury, showers upon them the wealth
of the Kingdom of Abhá. Although these believers live
in the remote Empires of Russia, Persia, Turkey, or Arabia,
yet he knows them and they know him. {{p328}} How they
hunger for and preserve every Tablet which he reveals
for them!   

###  2. In the Bahá’í Cause There Are No Salaried Teachers 

One of the believers asked him what should he do,
what course of action should he take up? He told him
to go and teach the Cause, spread the coming of the Kingdom
and herald the dawn of the Sun of Reality. To
convey the message is a confirmed matter. Whosoever
arises in this service will always be aided by the angels
of the Supreme Concourse. It is true that the friends
will do everything in their power to help a person who
devotes all his time to the service of the Cause, but let
there be no doubt on this subject, that in this movement
there are no regular salaried teachers. A paid teacher
will not be able to accomplish as much work as if he were
independent. In this cause ‘Abdu’l-Bahá desires to have
teachers who sacrifice all their belongings, possessions,
hearts, lives and spirits in the work of God. This would
be very effective. The Cause must be promulgated with
devotion and personal sacrifice, and not through financial
operations.   

###  3. Wit Is the Salt of Conversation 

Then he told us that, although he did not feel well, he
had written many letters to the believers of ‘Akká with
his own hand, because they were old and tried friends.   

He mentioned their names, one by one, a long list, I
assure you. {{p329}} Speaking about the Tablet written to Abú’l-Qásim,
the gardener, he said that Abú’l-Qásim had sent
some pomegranates to him from the garden, so that he
might write back that the skin of the pomegranates were
as rosy and pink as the cheeks of Jamílih (the gardener’s
wife), but that the former is through the creation of
God, while the latter through the power of devotion. He
laughed a great deal, finally saying that it is necessary
to joke now and then, for joking is the salt of conversation.   

###  4. The Second Party of Bahá’í Students Arrive 

About ten o’clock the second party of Bahá’í students
arrived from Haifa. They are all fine fellows, full of the
spirit of the Cause, and devoted to their studies. their
names are as follows: Habíb’u’lláh <u>Kh</u>udabak<u>sh</u>í, Badi‘‘’
Bu<u>sh</u>rúyyih, Mír Jalál, Mír Kamál, Abu’l Ḥasan <u>Kh</u>án,
Qulam Ḥusayn <u>Kh</u>án, Ḥasan <u>Kh</u>án, ‘Abdu’l ‘Alí and Ṭaráz’u’lláh.
The first two are very brilliant young men, and
owing to their superior wisdom and intelligence exercise
a most salutary influence over the student body. They
are, in a way, leaders without the name of leadership.
Badi‘‘’ Effendi is a versatile poet as well as Habíb’u’lláh.
The former sings beautifully, and on account of this advantage,
both of them have taught all the students Bahá’í
songs and poems. As soon as they entered the house,
the atmosphere was changed, and we heard snatches of
songs, now in solo and again in chorus. After a while
the Master sent for them and they had a short interview
with him. He fired their hearts with words of encouragement,
and hoped that they would combine together
literary knowledge with practical science. From now on
they will stand daily in the presence of the Master and
listen to his advice.   

###  5. Mrs. Fraser Arrives from America 

In the afternoon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá passed by, followed by
Shoghi Effendi. {{p330}} He called for me and I walked behind
him in the rose-garden. A telegram sent to Port Sa‘íd
from the Master to Aḥmad Yazdí: “Send Mrs. Fraser
to Ramleh,” brought back the answer that she had left
at one o’clock. He told me to go with Shoghi Effendi
to the station and bring her home. We were expecting
her for a few days. I was delighted to hear the
news.   

###  6. Mrs. Fraser is Welcomed at the Station by Shoghi
Effendi 

It was a hot day, but the rose-garden is always cool,
the fresh breeze wafting. The master asked Shoghi
Effendi to bring him a bottle of Evian water. Meanwhile
an Arab, who is a laborer, came in and saluted him.
The Arab told a long story, illustrating it with poems,
about the source of the Nile, that it is in paradise and
flows from under a throne — a pretty legend. Then a
few men came in to see the Master. He spoke to them
in detail on trustworthiness, and told them three stories
about his own life. For three hours we sat in his presence
listening with attention to every word he said. When
he left the rose-garden, Shoghi Effendi and I went to the
Sidi Jaber station to welcome our dear sister, Mrs. Fraser.
We greeted her on behalf of the Master. After ten
minutes, she stood before him. She is going to live with
the Holy Family, and I have no doubt that the Bahá’í
world will receive a rich and valuable treasure when her
Diary is given out.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 19, 1913. 

###  1. The American Bahá’ís Will Be Going to India 

With the early departure of Mr. and Mrs. Getsinger
and Mrs. Fraser to India, we will have three active teachers
in that great field. May they work together unitedly,
and hoist the banner of the Cause in that vast region!
Each one of these three Bahá’ís is gifted with a particular
spiritual talent, and when they combine their forces they
will be able to render a most brilliant service to the Cause.
To India, — a region of sects and creeds, — this truth goes
as a balm of reconciliation, a remedy for religious differences
and a cooling water of knowledge for those who
are thirsty. Their work will carry them through many
cities and the assistance of God will be with them. A
cable was received from Doctor Getsinger saying that he
would be here in three or four days.   

###  2. The Importance of the Art of Translation 

This morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent for the students. They
were all filled with hope and longing. When they stood
in his presence, he welcomed them and tea was served.
Having received the constitution of “a central London
Bahá’í Committee” which is in the process of organization,
he gave it to Badi‘‘’ Effendi to translate, and then delivered
a short talk on the art of translation, advising them to
write at least one page every day, either from English
into Persian, or from Persian into English, thus they
might acquire efficiency in this line of work. {{p332}} He recommended
for the future that when the means are provided,
a committee of translators be organized from both
nationalities, who would know the two languages well, in
addition to Arabic. Then the Tablets would be properly
translated. Again he spoke about Persia and the part
which they play in her reconstruction.   

###  3. The Past Glory of Persia and Her Future
Opportunity 

He said to the students that there was a time when
Persia was like a fragrant Bouquet, perfuming all nostrils.
She was the center of the glory and honor of the
world of humanity. The inhabitants of Persia from a
social, industrial, political and moral standpoint were
superior to the rest of mankind. Now conditions are
reversed and the same high standard is not kept waving
aloft. Like a great giant, she is prostrated on the ground,
groaning with a pitiful voice. If the Persians could
clearly see the sad and gloomy state of their own country,
they would weep bitter tears of remorse, but they are
all self-occupied. It is a natural and divine law that when
a nation or country sinks to the lowest degree of degradation,
then God, in His Bounty, comes to help her, uplifting
and raising her to the highest zenith of glory. As
Persia has experienced these sad events, the Lord in His
Mercy has willed that that country be illumined, so that
her future condition may become even more glorious than
her past, ad that she may advance greatly along the path
of science, industry and art. Now God has purposed that
they may become a means of this reformation, and strive
day and night that Persia may be enlightened. They
must equip themselves with practical education; — so that
Persia may be benefited through them. The Confirmations
of Abhá will always be theirs. {{p333}} If a person studies
all the sciences and arts, without receiving heavenly Confirmations,
he will not be able to accomplish very much.
Now he hopes that they will become the Cause of the
moral and scientific advancement of all the Persians.   

###  4. The Bahá’í Students Meet Mrs. Getsinger and Mrs.
Fraser in the Home of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

Afterwards he sent for Ḥájí Níáz, Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar,
Mírzá Maḥmúd and me. I was carrying a package of
Tablets just translated, which I gave to him. He took
it out of my hands and gave me a hard blow on my right
cheek. “Bravo,” he said. Then for a few minutes he
spoke about the events of Persia, and the attitude of the
governors toward the Cause, and the believers. A package
of petitions had just been received. He opened it
and read a few. They all contained good news about the
progress of the Cause in Persia. Then he went into his
own room and sent Mrs. Getsinger and Mrs. Fraser to
see us. When they entered the sight of them brought
me the significance of the Bahá’í Cause. Here we were,
four Persians and two American ladies meeting on the
ground of perfect spiritual friendship! Who has brought
to us this divine edifice in which we abide? Those who
have lived in the West all their lives, are not quit able
to realize this wonderful transformation; this alchemic
change of hearts. When we left them, I was yet under
the spell of the realization of it, and was more than ever
thankful to Bahá’u’lláh for thus uniting the hearts of the
East and the West by breaking away the barriers of
nationalities, and causing the appearance of the light of
Reality.   

###  5. Bahá’í Meeting for the Americans 

In the afternoon the students were taken to the garden
of Nozha by Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar and Ḥájí Níáz, after
which they attended a meeting in <u>Kh</u>urasání’s house,
where Mrs. Fraser, Mrs. Stannard and Miss Hiscock were
present. Mrs. Fraser had her first experience of a Persian-Arabic
Bahá’í meeting, and for her honor the students
sang Mrs. Waite’s poem of “Alláh–u–Abhá” and
other pieces. {{p334}} This gathering composed only of men,
must have appeared very picturesque and strange to her.
The Master attended the meeting for a few minutes. In
the evening several people visited him and he spoke with
them on the theological questions of the East, and of their
futility. While the students were in the Park, he passed
and asked for Mírzá Munír.   

###  6. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Amid a Profusion of Thousands of
Roses 

After a few minutes Mírzá Munír returned, saying
that the Master wanted us to go to the rose-garden.
Mírzá Jalál Síná, Mírzá Maḥmúd and I joined him.
He was sitting under the shade on a tree, while the
breezes played about him. This is a rose-garden divided
into two part, the first section overlooking the other and
joined together by steps. Daily twelve thousand roses,
pink, white, red, yellow, are sent to Alexandria and Cairo
florists. The fragrance of these roses is exhilarating.
The gardener is a simple Arab and most devoted to the
Master. He always jokes with him.   

###  7. Description of the Garden of Bahá’u’lláh in Ṭihrán 

After speaking and reciting several stories of the life
in ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reverted to the rose-garden, expressing
his love and admiration for roses. He said that
outside of Ṭihrán his family had a great park planted
by the Father of Bahá’u’lláh. {{p335}} This was a wonderful
garden. It contained four gates, Eastern, Western,
Northern and Southern. As you entered the Eastern
gate, the Western gate was visible, and similarly from the
Northern you could see the Southern gate. In the center
of the garden, a throne was built, the four great avenues
branching off toward the gates, so that you could see all
four gates as you sat on that throne. On both sides of
these avenues poplar trees were planted to the number
of ten thousand. These trees rose erect and majestic
toward the sky. Under them thousands of rose bushes
were growing, the fragrance of which filled the air. Often
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to sleep in this throne at night. The
moon, clear, full, silvery, shone upon him. The galaxy
of stars shedding their rays, now faintly, and again with
a lustrous twinkle over the calm and mystic scene of the
garden. Long before sunrise he would open his eyes
and look with wonder at this infinite universe of God.
Then the nightingales would break into a glorious concert
of divine music; the gentle murmur of the rills flowing
on all sides reached the ears, ad the zephyrs wafting
through the leaves made soft music, the branches hand-clapping
and applauding. In the early morning the
Blessed perfection would rise and prepare tea for the
family, and while the sun was dawning from the Eastern
horizon, they would gather about him, drinking tea and
enjoying the heavenly scene.   

Then he started to walk through the rose-garden, now
and then standing before a rose on a bush, contemplating
its structure and petals.   

###  8. A Single Rose in the Garden of Constantinople 

Looking at a rose which was very like an American
beauty, he said that it was just about this season when
he arrived in Constantinople. {{p336}} The garden of the
house where he lived contained one bush, on a branch
of which a single rose bloomed forth after sunset. The
believers, never having seen roses at this season were
overjoyed, and until late at night were gathered around it.   

------

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 20, 1913. 

###  1. Thoughts on the Mediterranean Shore 

It is ten o’clock P.M. I have just returned home,
after lying quietly on the shore of the Mediterranean for
more than an hour. While my body was stretched on
the soft sand, my eyes gazing at the infinite orbs of light,
my spirit was holding communion with the friends beyond
the seas. The night was dark and still, and my ears
enjoyed the music of the waves, murmuring along the
shore. Here I am, I thought, and where will I be in
the future? Did I ever dream last year that I would be
returning to the East in the service of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá?
Truly, how our own plans seem futile when compared
with the glorious plan mapped for us by the Designer of
the Universe! How often in a foolish fit of pride we
prefer our own pigmy scheme to that of the Almighty!
The Cause is great and our destiny is very high! {{p337}} I praise
God for thus taking me out of the noise and clamor of
the West into the calm and beautiful serenity of the East!
As Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl said the other day:   

“You are now in the school. Daily you are learning
your lessons but the time may come when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
will send you away into the world to carry out his will
and to serve the cause of humanity.”   

###  2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Talks to Mrs. Fraser and Mrs. Getsinger
About Their Trip to India 

This morning after the students had visited the Master,
we were sent for, and he dwelt on the same subject
on which he had spoken with them. It was on the internal
condition of the Cause in Ṭihrán and the history of
one of the believers. Then he told me that I might come
at any time to see Mrs. Getsinger and Mrs. Fraser to talk
with them about the details of the plan of their voyage to
India and prepare for them a list of addresses. For an
hour in the afternoon we discussed their approaching visit.
The former gave me a copy of her diary of yesterday,
and I will quote here a part of it: —   

>  “Suddenly turning to me, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked, <q class="abd">‘Can you
think of an excuse to secretly take me to India with you?
What plans have you made for India?’</q> ‘I have no plans,’
I answered, ‘except to obey the will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!’
Then turning to both of us, he said: <q class="abd">‘What will you do
if they dispute these teachings?’</q> Mrs. Getsinger answered,
‘I shall turn to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and call upon him for
spiritual confirmation. After repeating the Greatest
Name, I shall open my mouth and say what is given me
to say.’ <q class="abd">‘What will you do if they beat you?’ ‘What
will you do if they put you in prison’</q> ‘I shall thank
God that I have walked in His path, and have been permitted
to share what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has suffered for years.’ 

>  “‘Abdu’l-Bahá was silent for a moment. Then he raised
his voice, giving it a dramatic emphasis — <q class="abd">‘And what will
you do if they kill you?’</q> {{p338}} ‘I shall realize that the
first favor that I ever asked of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had been granted.
And the minute my soul is freed from my body, I will fly
to God from whom I hope it will never be separated
through all eternity.’ 

>  “There was a silence. The master’s eyes were closed.
Then he told us: <q class="abd">When one goes forth to teach, he should
think of all these things. He must be prepared at all
times, for whatever comes in the path of God. During
the many years that he was in prison, each moment he
lived under the sword. He felt that perhaps tomorrow,
or tonight, or in an hour, or on the very hour, an order
might come from the Sulṭán to kill all of them. He never
went to bed a single night all that time, thinking to see
the morrow!”</q> 

###  3. Mr. Hooper Harris and Harlan Ober’s Trip to India 

In this connection let me bring to your attention the
good and excellent Bahá’í work done in India, by our two
American brothers, Mr. Hooper Harris of New York
and Mr. Harlan Ober of Boston. Both these brothers
scattered far and wide the seeds of the Bahá’í Cause, and
their memories are always kept fresh in the hearts of
those who have seen or heard them. Their services will
never be forgotten. Like true, staunch pioneers, they
worked nobly and faithfully, and when they returned,
they laid many laurels of victory at the feet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
With the lamps of guidance in their hands, these
other teachers will soon hasten toward India, and will
summon all to the kingdom of Abhá, and impart the Glad-tidings
of Peace and Brotherhood.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 21, 1913. 

###  1. The Story of the King and His Search for the
Fountain of Life 

“Please tell me a story,” I asked Siyyid Jalál Síná as
I saw down in the front of my writing table.   

“Once upon a time,” he started without hesitation, “a
king of antiquity who had conquered many countries, and
had raised the Flag of his authority over many climes,
became restless and discontented with his lot. On the
occasion of a New Year’s Day, when all the Cabinet Ministers,
Dignitaries of the States, colonial Governors and
officials of remote countries had gathered in the capital to
pay homage and tribute to their emperor, and while he
was sitting on his diamond-studded throne, with all these
men standing before him, he raised his voice addressing
the concourse of officials, clothed in their dazzling robes
of ceremony:   

“‘My friends! From my earliest youth, I have obtained
everything for which my heart has wished. I have
had the good fortune of receiving wise instruction from
excellent teachers and statesmen. Then having attained
the age of maturity, I ascended the throne after the death
of my father. I have ever striven to keep Peace within
the vast heterogeneous elements of my empire, and have
extended the boundaries of my possessions beyond the
seas. The mighty arms of my generals have carried the
authority of my government, and the influence of my
laws to the confines of the earth. Notwithstanding these
things, I am not contented. My heart longs for the
attainment of an object which seems to my mortal eyes
unattainable. I do not know what it is, but I feel that
there is something for the possession of which I am ready
to give up my whole empire. {{p340}} The idea has occurred to
me that I may ask each of you to relate the story and the
experiences of your lives, perchance through your narration
I may be able to learn the secret of this longing which
is knocking at the door of my heart.’   

“For several minutes the great throng of people in the
audience-chamber fell into a deep silence, so deep that
if a pin had been dropped, one could have heard its fall.
They looked furtively at each other, and each wondered
in his heart, ‘What is this Something for whose possession
the king is willing to forfeit his whole Empire?’ At
last, the prime Minister arose from his seat, and related
a long story about his experiences. He sat down, and
others followed in the order of succession. All the while
the king shook his head, showing that the problem had not
been solved. Finally an old man, who had been the wise
mentor and guide of the king from his early childhood,
rose from his seat and, with a penetrating and convincing
voice, spoke as follows:   

“‘Sire! I know the object of your Majesty’s search.
You are longing for the water of Life, the fountain of
which is situated in the Kingdom of Darkness. I have
been there. I have seen it with my own eyes, and have
drunk of it deeply. Now having attained to Eternal
Youth, I am bound for the Kingdom of Light.’ ‘Oh!
Oh!’ the king exclaimed, rising from his throne, and shaking
off his lethargy, ‘that is the thing that I have wished
for, all my life, but I did not know what it was. From
this very moment I will make preparations to start the
search and will close my eyes to all rest and comfort till
I have found it.’ Then he ordered his generals to summon
the army, and issued an edict for the Imperial
Guards to prepare to start on a long journey. After a
week of feverish work, everything was ready and the
king appointed his successor.   

“On the last day, the inhabitants of the capital arranged
a mammoth open air reception, and when the king had
delivered a farewell speech, amid flying colors, and to the
singing of the national anthem, he started at the head of
his great army for the Kingdom of Darkness. {{p341}} After
many months of journey through desolate deserts and
over impassable mountains, the exhausted army reached
the desired destination. But the king, to his great disappointment,
remembered that the old man had told him in
a private meeting, that there were about 2000 fountains
in the Kingdom of Darkness, and as regard to color, taste
and property, they were exactly alike.   

“Therefore it would be a matter of impossibility to distinguish
one from the other. Thinking that all the hardships
of this arduous journey would be crowned with no
success, and filled with apprehension and terror at the
gloomy darkness enveloping his innumerable legions, with
no possibility of escape, he resigned himself to the hand
of Fate, and began to think how he and his army could
manage to extricate themselves from the impenetrable
gloom. At this juncture, the same old man appeared on
the scene, and the king’s hope immediately revived. He
confided to him his great perplexity at not being able to
find the real Fountain of Life, inasmuch as there were
so many of them.   

“‘This is very easy,’ the wise one said. ‘I have come
here especially to relieve your mind from further anxiety
on this point. Here is a dead fish. Take it along with
you. When you reach a fountain, drop it in. If it is
revived, you will know, without a doubt, that you have the
Fountain of Life before your eyes.’   

“The old man disappeared in the same mysterious
way. The king thus heartened by the advice of his mentor,
ordered his army to decamp and to continue the journey.
After several days, they reached a large fountain,
and as soon as the king dropped the fish into the water,
it became a living, moving creature. {{p342}} He prostrated himself
on the ground, and thanked God for thus guiding
him at last to the Fountain of Life. And so he camped
there for a few days, and drank deeply of the water,
gaining new life, new hope and new courage.   

“Realizing that he had attained to the supreme object
of his existence, he decided to return. Just before their
departure, a great, invisible voice filled the air. ‘Whoso
ever takes away the stones from the bottom of the Fountain
of Life, will regret it afterwards, and whosoever does
not take the stones will also regret.’ The people were
puzzled, and did not know what to do. Should they take,
or should they not take? Finally a number of them filled
their pockets, under the pretext that even if they did not
take any, they would regret, so that it was just as well to
take them; others argued, why should they burden themselves
with any of these stones, and then regret it afterwards.
So it happened that half of the army possessed
themselves of the stones, and the other half returned
empty-handed. When they came out of the kingdom of
Darkness, they observed to their great astonishment, that
these stones were precious gems. Those who had taken
them, regretted that they had not taken more, and those
who were empty-handed, regretted that they had not taken
any. Thus both sides were afflicted with remorse and
regret.   

“Now, instead of giving the full significance of this
story, I will give you the key. The king, every man:
Old man, reason; Fountain of Life, religion; Fish, the
heart; Invisible voice, Intuition; Stones, good deeds;
Kingdom of Darkness, material world; Kingdom of light,
spiritual world; Eternal youth, Everlasting life; {{p343}} Two
thousand fountains, Creeds and sects.”   

###  2. The Simplicity of Life, and How the Arabs Live on
the Desert 

In the morning the Master came to our house and s
a preliminary to his talk, spoke about the renewal of the
rent, which, of course, meant a longer stay in Ramleh.
than as naturally he fell into a description of the complexity
of the means of modern life.   

How complex are the means of life in the present age,
and how much more complex are we making them daily!
The people’s needs seem never to come to an end. The
more they accumulate, the more they want. There is only
one way of freedom, and that is by shutting one’s eyes
and heart to all these things that distract the mind. The
Arab of the desert teaches us a great lesson in the simple
life. Living as he does, in the vast Sahara, he lacks all
means except a tent, a rug or mat, a caldron, a sword
hanging to the inside pole of the tent, and a javelin tied
to the outside pole. This is all his furniture. Then if
he is wealthy, he has a mare, or a horse, a few camels,
and maybe, adjoining his tent, a palm grove. It never
occurs to his mind, that thee is anything else in this
world. He is happy and he has no worry. His food
consists of a bowl of milk and a few dates, and he may
well wonder how the city man can digest all the different
kinds of dishes with their flavors and spices. He enjoys
perfect health. His thought is peaceful and serene, contrary
to the city people, who are always haunted by the
nightmare of making a bare livelihood.   

###  3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Talks with Mrs. Fraser 

Afterwards I went to see the Master. He was surrounded
by many people and was talking and writing at
the same time. {{p344}} In the afternoon, I visited Mrs. Fraser
and Mrs. Getsinger and for quite a while we talked together
about their forthcoming trip to India. Both are
full of enthusiasm and are looking forward with great
pleasure to their approaching experiences. In the evening,
the Master sent for me and in speaking with Mrs.
Fraser, told her that he was very pleased with her, because
as soon as she received his cablegram, although there
were difficulties in the path, she pushed them aside and
came. The Confirmations of the Kingdom of Abhá shall
descend upon her. She was going to India in the service
of the Kingdom of God and the Angels of the Supreme
Concourse shall assist her. Let her rest assured. Because
her heart is pure, she will attract to herself the
heavenly Bestowals.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 22, 1913. 

###  1. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Spiritual Moods 

Last night, when Mrs. Fraser left the room, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
continued to walk. He was fatigued. He sat down
and closed his eyes, saying how glad he would be when
he leaves this world; this world of darkness and sorrow,
pain and suffering. He sighed. It seemed to me that he
was too exhausted to speak another word, and I was going
to retire. Then somehow, Mrs. Haney’s letter came to
my mind, so I said:

“I had a letter from Mrs. Haney the other day, in which
she expressed great joy at reading the story of the Self-sacrifice
of Mullá Mihdí Kandí.”   

Immediately he opened his eyes, and looked like a
different person, as though supplied by a tremendous force
from an invisible source. {{p345}} As soon as the name of this
martyr was mentioned he was energized, got up from his
seat, and began to speak with inspiration and eloquent
fervor, throwing additional sidelights upon the life of that
divine martyr, and then just as unconsciously, a clear
stream of words flowed from his tongue in praise of
Mary Magdalene, and of how she became the cause of
the constancy and steadfastness of the disciples of Christ.   

###  2. Doctor Getsinger’s Arrival in Alexandria 

This morning Shoghi Effendi entered my room with
a wireless message, just arrived from Dr. Getsinger, advising
us of his arrival Monday morning, and as this was
Monday, the Master sent word for me to go to the wharf
to welcome him. I was on my way without delay, and
had to wait until noon. The “Prince Heinrich” of the
German Line appeared, and after a few minutes, I spied
Doctor Getsinger on the deck. We had to wait two
hours in the Custom House before we were freed, and
then taking a carriage, and putting his trunks and valise
in front, we drove to Ramleh.   

At four o’clock the Master greeted him in his house,
and about six we called on Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl. He was
very glad to welcome Dr. Getsinger back to the Orient
and inquired about many believers in Washington, Chicago
and New York. Then a historical discussion about
the Bible and the exact date in which Zoroaster lived
waxed hot until the Master came in. We all sat on the
balcony for a few moments, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá joked with
Doctor Getsinger, reminding him of the days when he
was traveling with him in America.   

He dictated a long Tablet to the believers of Mazindárán
in the garden. {{p346}} Returning from his walk he came
to our house and spoke with the students. Thus he attends
to his flock with care and solicitude Doctor Getsinger
is going to have a room in the New Victoria Hotel
as the guest of the Master.   

###  3. Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Bahá’ís in Leipzig,
Germany 

“He is God!   

“O YE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE KINGDOM!   

“The heavenly daughter, Miss Knoblock, has given
the utmost praise about your Faith and Love; that Glory
be to God, you heard the call of the Kingdom, that your
spirits gained the capacity of flight, your hearts were
illumined with the Light of Guidance, you drank the
Elixir of Bestowal from the Cup of Divine Knowledge
and became intoxicated with the Wine of the Kingdom.
Thank God that He has chosen you from amongst all
The people of the world and has granted you such an eminent
Gift: — so that each one may enter into the Kingdom
of God, and like unto the stars may shine and gleam.
This Bestowal of the Most great Guidance is not so apparent
now, but in future ages, it will illumine the East
and the West.   

“Consider that during the days of His Holiness Christ —
 Upon Him be Glory — no one gave any importance
to the guidance of the Apostles. The populace pretended
that a number of insignificant souls, who were catchers
of fishes, had gathered around a poor man and were talking
foolishly. They laughed even at the Blessed Personage
of Christ and spat upon that radiant, luminous
and wonderful Countenance. {{p347}} But reflect that afterward
the guidance of those catchers of fish became famous
throughout all regions, and up to this time mankind is
glorifying and praising them.   

“Upon ye be Bahá’u’l-Abhá!   

(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”   

###  4. Another Tablet to a German Bahá’í Asking How to
Teach 

“He is God!   

“ O THOU RESPECTED YOUTH!   

“How many holy souls in past ages have longed most
intensely to hear the name of the Divine Kingdom and
live during the day of the Promised one of all the nations
of the world; but they passed away and left this world
with utter regret, because they did not attain to their
wish. In this radiant Century God has so confirmed
thee that thou mayst step into the Universe of Life, be
trained in the Cradle of God’s Protection and Preservation,
suck the milk of tenderness from the breast of
Providence and take a share and a portion from the Light
of Guidance. Consider what a great Favor is this! What
a wonderful bounty! Therefore loosen thy tongue in
the glorification of this most Great Bestowal and summon
the people to the Kingdom of God, so that others may
receive a goodly portion from this Holy Cause.   

“Upon thee be Bahá el Abhá.   

(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.”

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 23, 1913. 

###  1. Speeches to be Delivered at Public Meetings 

As now and then the question of public speaking in the
Bahá’í meetings has more or less agitated the minds of the
believers, I desire to quote herein an extract from a recent
Tablet which will show clearly the attitude of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
on this rather important matter:   

“Rest ye assured that the Breaths of the Holy Spirit
shall inspire you with the power of speech. Consequently,
loosen your tongues and speak in every meeting with undaunted
courage. First, before beginning, turn your
face toward Bahá’u’lláh, beg for the Confirmation of the
Holy Spirit, and then open your tongues and speak out
whatever is dictated to your hearts. Speak with the utmost
serenity, conviction and dignity. I hope that day
by day the circle of your meetings may be enlarged and
that the investigators of Reality may listen to the proofs
and arguments. With heart and soul, I am with you
in every meeting. Be ye confident.”   

###  2. History of the Life of Arminius Vambery 

This morning, with Doctor Getsinger, I called on Mrs.
Getsinger and Mrs. Fraser and had a long talk with both
of them. Then Mrs. Stannard came and the conversation
turned upon the death of Prof. Vambery in Budapest, and
his most significant letter written to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá just a
few days before he died. This letter will be published
in the Egyptian Gazette and copies of the same will be
sent to the European Press. He was well-known all over
Europe on account of his travels in the interior of Asia,
and on account of his writings. Mrs. Stannard thinks that
this letter is one of the most wonderful documents of the
Cause on account of the importance of the man, for he
wrote with thorough understanding, and sympathy. {{p349}} The
European Press prints long articles about his adventures
and early life, and singles him out as a unique man.   

Arminius Vambery was born in Hungary in the Village
of Duna-Szerdahely, in March, 1832. His father was a
Jew in humble circumstances. He was apprenticed at
the age of twelve, to a dressmaker, but having acquired
some book learning, he presently became tutor to a publican’s
son. After enduring much privation, he had mastered,
by the time he was sixteen, several other languages
besides Latin. Four years later, he went to Constantinople,
where he was engaged as tutor by Ḥusayn Din
Pá<u>sh</u>á. In 1853, he brought out a German-Turkish Dictionary.
He had now lived so long in the East, that he
could pass for an Osmani, and in 1862 he started on
his long and arduous journey to Central Asia. He disguised
himself as a Dervish which disguise he assumed at
Ṭihrán because of a knowledge of Persian and Turkish
and of a careful practice, not only of the customs of
Orientals generally, but also of the ways of the Dervishes —
the mendicant friars of Islám. He made his way
to Khive, where he was granted two audiences by the
<u>Kh</u>án. The Amir of Bokhara heard suspicious stories of
the traveler, but having seen that Rashid Effendi, as
Vamberey called himself, was a good Moslem and all that
he professed to be, dismissed him with handsome presents.
On his return to Europe, Vambery paid a visit to
England, where he met with a reception both from the
geographers and the public. His first account of his
“Travels and Adventures in Central Asia” was published
in London in 1864, and had a large circulation. {{p350}} He
wrote also a “History of Bokhara,” based chiefly on the
works of Persian and Arabic historians.   

In recognition of his linguistic attainments, Vambery
was appointed Professor of Oriental languages at Budapest.
He frequently visited England, and seldom missed
an opportunity to give his opinions in European periodicals
on any new developments of Eastern and Middle
Eastern politics.   

During the visit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Budapest, Vamberey
met him twice. His knowledge of Oriental languages,
especially Persian, Arabic and Turkish, was amazing.
He was a pleasant looking old man of rather short stature
and wrinkled face. In the course of conversation with
the Master, he said:   

>  “For many years have I followed your teachings and
ever longed to meet you. I admire more than anything
else your supreme courage in that at this advanced age
you have left everything and are traveling all over the
west to spread your humane principles. You are doing
a great work. It will be crowned with success, because
your sincerity, unwavering faith and high ideals have
stamped themselves upon the minds of the World’s
thinkers.” 

His last words as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá bade him farewell in
his long drawing-room and library, were these: —   

>  “I hope to hear from you. Please when you return
to the East, send me the writings and Treatises of your
Father and I will do everything to spread them in Europe.
The more these principles are disseminated, the nearer
will be the age of peace and brotherhood.” 

The story of how Vambery, physically afflicted, for
he was lame, fought for existence against hunger, and
persecution, and gradually mounted the ladder of fame,
furnishes one of the most remarkable pages of the history
of the Jewish race. At school Vambery once said: —   

>  “Hunger, mockery and insult — I experienced them all
in turn; {{p351}} but the greatest misery was not capable of darkening
the serene sky of youthful mirth for more than
a few minutes, and even my healthy color returned after
a short interval of bodily collapse.” 

He was well received at the English Court both in
the reign of Queen Victoria and in that of King Edward.
On the occasion of his seventieth birthday, in 1902, his
Majesty conferred upon him the title of Commander of
the Victorian Order. The present King of England,
when the Prince of Wales, proved equally amiable when
the distinguished Hungarian Professor stayed at Sandringham.
One day, while the latter was occupied with
his correspondence, he received a message from Queen
Alexandra, inviting him to join her in the garden. Vamberey
wished to wash his hands before going, but there
was no one in sight. At length the Prince appeared, and
asked him what he wanted. Vamberey told him, and the
Prince disappeared, returning in a few minutes with a
large jug in his hand, which he placed, smiling, on the
washstand. Thus was a poor Jewish beggar-student of
former days, waited upon by a Royal Prince, whom,
moreover, he had the temerity to name “The Royal Jug-bearer.”   

In the afternoon and evening many people of various
nationalities called on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the demands of
several “gentlemen beggars” were satisfied. When I
was walking in the evening with two others, we passed
by a house, the windows of which were open; we looked
in and saw the Master sitting on the Divan talking with
the Pá<u>sh</u>á.   

<q class="abd">“God has created us that we may love each other”</q> —
 were the words that came to our ears as we passed by.

###  RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 24, 1913. 

###  1. A Persian Bahá’í student delivers a lecture in English. 

Since the arrival of the students from Haifa, table-talks
have become the fashion. {{p352}} These talks are delivered
in English. Now and then one hears a good speech,
short and to the point. It seems to me very interesting
how these young men are eager to learn everything from
everywhere and thus increase their fund of information,
so that in the future they may become able to teach the
Cause with eloquent tongues and fluent speeches. Why
then, do they practice in English rather than in Persian
one might ask? This in itself, of course, is another sign
commingling of interests and ideals. The one all-absorbing
thought of these young men is to equip themselves
with the mental instruments whereby they may
go out to war against ignorance, selfishness and greed.
I may therefore quote one or two short addresses given
by these budding orators. The following is an example:

“Gentlemen! Bahá’í Brothers! About seven thousand
years ago, according to the religious history, God the
Maker of all things through His Mercy and Providence
created the world and made man after his own image and
likeness. Since that time up to the present day, His
Manifestations have successively appeared upon the earth
and thus the dark world has been quickened and vivified
through the spiritual vibrations of their divine Teachings.
By this education mankind has attained to a higher
degree of knowledge. It has passed over the arc of
ascent, until now it has obtained the capacity for the
recognition of the Manifestation of God. When His
Holiness Moses appeared, thousands believed in him, and
having received and lived according to his divine teachings,
became leaders of other nations. {{p353}} God showed them
His Love and showered upon them His blessings like
unto a torrent. He freed them from the tyrannical yoke
of Pharoah, brought them out of Egypt, and established
them in the Promised Land. He sent down for them
manna from heaven, He cleft asunder the sea and made
a safe passage for them to pass through. He called them
His children and they became worthy of every praise and
embodied every virtue. Later, they forgot the heavenly
laws, followed their own inclinations and worshiped
idols instead of the Almighty Jehovah. As a result they
stopped progressing. Their civilization waned and their
moral virtues retrograded. For many ages they were
scattered, humiliated and scorned. But now, praise be
to God, they are stirred with a new life, resuscitated with
a new spirit, and many of them are quickened by the call
of the Kingdom. The Lord of Hosts hath come, the
King of Kings hath appeared. The rays of the sun of
His Mercy have enlightened them and the Breeze of His
Benevolence has wafted over them. Thus are they endowed
with a seeing eye, a hearing ear and an understanding
heart. 

“One of these blessed souls is a brilliant young man of
30 years of age. His face is shining, his speech is winsome,
his heart is radiant with the light of the Love of
God, and his countenance is as pure and bright as the
brightest diamond. His dark, ample brow, his towering
forehead, his slender nose, and his graceful manners denote
a sensitive nature and a true Bahá’í. His attitude is
well-disciplined, his character, and his nature amicable.
His intentions are pure, his desires holy and his aims
philanthropic and he thinks ever of the welfare of the
world of humanity. My humble delineation of this gentleman
seems quite superfluous when we remember the
repeated praises and commendations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in
reference to him. {{p354}} His word is a divine testimony, a
heavenly witness and a celestial blessing. The name of
this young man is Doctor Habíb’u’lláh Khodabaksh. He
is sitting now at this table, and is one of the promising
Bahá’ís of this century of light and knowledge. We
heartily congratulate him and offer him our best wishes,
hoping that he will be assisted by God to cure the ills
of humanity, both physical and spiritual; bestow eternal
life upon every dead one, and cause mankind to obtain
immortality by leading it to the fountainhead of light
and bounty.” 

### 2. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Wishes the Bahá’í Students to Take
Post-graduate Courses 

This morning the Master received the students. His
talk to them was about his lecture in Leland Stanford
University, praising meanwhile, the President, Doctor
Jordan, and his labors, in the field of International Peace.
He encouraged the students to take post-graduate courses
in that University, because he had spoken about this
matter with Doctor Jordan. Already many are considering
going there, and they mean to write to the President
to ask for particulars. 

### 3. The Mission of the Bahá’í Cause Is Universal and
Not Local 

Yesterday the new Persian Consul General arrived
from Constantinople and the Master sent all the students
to welcome him at the steamer and today, with Mírzá
‘Alí-Akbar, he went to Alexandria to pay him a visit, in
the hotel where he is staying for a few days before his
departure for Jadda. {{p355}} In the course of conversation ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
pointed out to the Consul General the impartial attitude
of the Bahá’ís in recent developments in Persia
and how they are the lovers of Peace and progress. The
mission of the Bahá’í Cause is universal and not local; its
principles are for all humanity; its objects are world-wide.
The Bahá’ís are the army of spiritual and intellectual
advancements. Then he spoke a few words about
the promotion of the Cause in America and Europe.
The Consul General became very attracted, and made an
engagement to come next day and call on the Master.
On his way back in the street car, the Master showed love
and kindness to a little child with his mother. The child
was so attracted, that he came and sat next to him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
gave him a present and kissed him, and the mother
thankfully and happily carried him away, reluctant.

### RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 25, 1913. 
### 1. An Analysis of the Letters of UNITY by a Persian
Student 

The other day I was speaking with one of the students
as we were walking along a broad avenue. The
subject was “Unity,” a word much used in the Bahá’í
Movement. “Unity,” he said, “is the foundation of all
successful undertakings. With unity of purpose, a harmonious
action is produced. When various elements
are brought together, and basic unity is established, an
organism is the result. In the political world, Union
is the watchword of all the statements and in the Bahá’í
world it has a deep significance. {{p356}} The aim of this Cause
is, as we all know, a confederation of the world’s religious
systems, a consolidation of the political interests of
the nations, and a truly grand realization of the brotherhood
of man. To my mind, every letter in the world
‘Unity’ stands for a great principle or quality. For example,
‘U’ stands for ‘understanding,’ we must at all
times try to understand truth impartially and improve
our minds; ‘N’ stands for ‘nourishment’; once we have
acquired understanding, we must ‘nourish’ it with wisdom
and knowledge and cleanse it with the water of intelligence;
‘I’ stands for ‘investment’; if we have a capital
we should ‘invest’ it, in order to increase it. The Bahá’ís
must teach the Cause and spread the Glad-tidings of the
kingdom of Abhá and awaken those who are asleep. ‘T’
is for ‘thoughtfulness’; before teaching we must think,
or in other words, before teaching others we must teach
ourselves. ‘Y’ means ‘yield’ to the truth. If you investigate
an object and realize that it is reality, yield to it.
Don’t shut your eyes to the truth, once you have seen
the glory of its beauty. Let us cling to the truth, as a
shipwrecked sailor clings to the cliff. In short, our aim
is to ‘understand’ everything in a comprehensive manner,
to ‘nourish’ our understanding with the truths from every
clime, to ‘invest’ our acquired knowledge in the best possible
channel pleasing to our Lord; practice ‘thoughtfulness’
under all circumstances and ‘yield’ to Reality no
matter from what horizon it dawns — thus may we become
the cause of UNITY in the world of humanity.” 

### 2. Story of the Stork, Fish and Prawn 

At this juncture Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar joined us and asked
what we were talking about. We told him. 

“Let me tell you a story,’ he said, “which illustrates
this very point. Once upon a time there was a stork,
a fish and a prawn. {{p357}} They became friends and planned
to travel together. They said to each other that they
would do everything in ‘Unity’; but the stork wanted to
start on the journey by way of the air, the fish through
the watery paths of the river, and the prawn by the track
of a pond. The three formed a board of consultation
to see which mode was the best for traveling together.
They had several sessions, lasting for hours, but they
could not determine upon any plan, each one insisting
that his opinion was correct, and not willing to yield
to the other. Finally they saw a little baby carriage not
far away and decided to use it as a common vehicle for
traveling. They came and hitched themselves to the
carriage, confident that their differences were now
brought to an end; but, no sooner did they start than they
began to assert their varied natures. The stork flew
‘upward,’ the fish went ‘forward’ and the prawn was pushing
‘backward.’”

### RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 26, 1913. 
### 1. ‘I<u>sh</u>qabád, Russia, an Important Center of the
Bahá’ís Movement 

The city of ‘I<u>sh</u>qabád is an important Bahá’í center
wherein the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár is built. The Bahá’ís
are free to teach and pursue their religious principles
without any molestation on the part of the Russian authorities.
In that city the Bahá’ís are quite numerous
and are respected by all classes. During the last few
days the Master has been entertaining a believer from
that city by the name of Aḥmad Áqá and now he is
going away, his life perfumed with Fragrances of the
Love of God. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has revealed three Tablets
for the believers in that city. {{p358}} He came this morning
and after reading them aloud, handed them to Aḥmad
Áqá to be taken to ‘I<u>sh</u>qabád. Here are the translations
of two of these Tablets: 

### 2. Tablets to the Bahá’ís of ‘I<u>sh</u>qabád 
“O YE BELIEVERS IN THE HEART
AND SPIRIT OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ! 
“It has been well-nigh three years since this Servant
at the Threshold of Bahá has been a wanderer over
mountain and desert and a traveler upon plain and sea.
One morning I was in this province and one night I spent
in another. As the express train speeded over vast
stretches of land and traversed long distances, — thus
joining together the remotest parts, — I became associated
with and the confident participator of very meeting
and sang the praises of the Lord in each assembly. Day
and night I was teaching and explaining and in public
gatherings and important Congresses I upraised my
voice. I imparted the Glad-tidings of the Sun of Reality
and made an exposition of Divine proofs and Arguments.
I laid the foundation of the Teachings of God
and elucidated the truth of the Merciful Effulgence. 
“After enduring infinite hardships, traveling through
and visiting many countries, diffusing the Fragrances
of God and promoting His lordly instructions, I returned
to the East. But the difficulties of this long voyage were
so numerous, that toward the end, my body was attacked
by a severe illness and I was at the point of breaking
down. {{p359}} this is the reason why correspondence has been
suspended for such a long time. 
“Now, praise be to God, my constitution is, to a certain
extent, reinforced and the illness removed, and therefore
day and night I am engaged in answering letters.
Not for a moment do I rest or seek comfort. Continually
do I remember the friends and as far as possible,
I am writing to them. Truly I say, ‘I<u>sh</u>qabád is the city
of Love. Each one of the friends of God is occupied
with service and engaged in adoration. They are the
friends and the companions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. 
“As regards the members of school committees, in
reality they are serving with heart and soul and perform
their duties with rejoicing. They put forward
extraordinary exerting in organizing and systematizing
the school and in the instruction of the pupils while all
the other believers are assisting and cooperating with
them. On this account, I am greatly pleased with the
friends of that region. Day and night do I supplicate
and ask heavenly assistance: — so that that city may become
the envy of all the cities of the world. 
“O God! O God! This is a city wherein the Fragrances
of Thy Holiness are spread, the delightful odors
of the garden of Thy Mercifulness are diffused and from
which the voices of glorification and thanksgiving, praises
and commendations to the Lord of the Kingdom, are
raised. For he has revealed Himself on Mount Sinai
with a light of radiant effulgence wherefrom the regions
are illuminated. Glory be unto Him who hath caused the
appearances of the Morn! Glory be unto Him who
sendeth the winds! Glory be unto Him who resuscitates
the spirits! {{p360}} Glory be unto Him who breathes into the
bodies of the world the inspiration of Existence! 
“O Lord! Accept their supplication toward Thee!
their trust in Thee and their invocation between Thy
Hands! Verily Thou art the Merciful! thou art the
Great! and Thou art the Ancient Lord! 
(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.” 

The next Tablet is the following: 
“He is God! 
“O YE BLESSED SOULS! 
“The beloved pilgrim like unto an overflowing cup
has a heart full of your praises. Continually this Servant
expects that all the believers unloose their tongues in
the commendation of the friends; nay rather, they may
adore each other and sacrifice their wealth, comfort, life
and spirit for the sake of one another. 
“O ye friends! This Cycle is the Cycle of Bestowal
and this period is the period of Mercy. All the seasons
are the seasons of spring and all the periods are the
periods of the Grace of the Almighty. The Breeze of
Providence is wafting, the Fragrances of the rose-garden
of the realities and significances are perfuming the nostrils
and the melody of the Kingdom of Mercifulness
has stirred into joy and happiness the heart and the soul!
What a delightful age is this! What a heart-attracting
century! But a thousand times alas! that the spiritually
dead are not awakened by the blowing of the trumpet of
Revelation, that the blind are deprived of the sight of
the world-illuminating Orb while those afflicted with colds
cannot inhale the odor of sanctity. praise be to God
that ye have opened your eyes, have won the ball from
the arena of self-sacrifice, prostrated yourself before
the Threshold of His Highness the Merciful, become the
manifestators of the Favors of the Incomparable Beloved
and at all times are advancing and progressing! 
“Upon ye be Bahá el Abhá! 
(Signed) “‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ ‘ABBÁS.” 

This morning the Master passed by our house, went
into the garden and dictated many Tablets for the Eastern
and Western believers. {{p361}} About eleven o’clock he returned
and stayed a few minutes. The students were speaking
together in English when he suddenly entered and laughed
heartily over their speaking in a foreign tongue. Then
he went to the Mosque, followed by Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar.
Again in the afternoon he was in the garden revealing
Tablets. Toward five o’clock we went to the meeting.
Doctor Getsinger talked about the Master’s address in
the Jewish Synagogue of Washington.

### RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 27, 1913. 
### 1. Tablet in the Handwriting of Bahá’u’lláh 

Have you ever seen the original writings of Bahá’u’lláh?
Tablets written with His own blessed Hand?
I had the privilege of seeing such a Tablet today. Just
think to hold and read with your own eyes a Tablet
written by Bahá’u’lláh’s own Hand! For many minutes
I looked at the writing. The Tablet belongs to Ḥájí
Níáz. He went to Cairo yesterday morning and returned
in the evening bringing it with him. 

When years ago he was in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh,
he requested Him to reveal for him something. {{p362}} The
Blessed Perfection took pen and paper and wrote the
following prayer. 

### 2. Prayer for Spiritual Strength by Bahá’u’lláh 
“He is the Knowing, the Wise! 
“O God! O God! I beg of Thee by Thy Radiant, Collective
Name, to change the humiliation of Thy Chosen
ones into Thy Glory; their weakness into Thy Strength;
their impotence into Thy Omnipotence; their poverty
into Thy Wealth and their fear into Thy Assurance. 
“O Lord! Illumine their hearts by the Light of Thy
Knowledge! 
“O Lord! Behold Thou these thirsty ones journeying
toward the River of Thy Bestowal and the Ocean of Thy
Generosity. Verily Thou art the Powerful, The Mighty,
the Benevolent.” 

### 3. Someone Must Arise to Write the Life History
of Bahá’u’lláh 

What would one not give to receive such a prayer
from the Hand of Bahá’u’lláh. Truly this was a great
bestowal. These old men who have seen Bahá’u’lláh
many times are to my eyes very wonderful. I always
look upon them with a peculiar reverence and respect.
If someone had the time just to write down their stories,
they would make, I am sure, most interesting reading.
One of the most dramatic events connected with this
Movement is the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh. Ḥájí Níáz
was living in ‘Akká that tin=me and for six months after the
ascension. He has witnessed everything, and having
once heard his story, I will some day reduce it to writing;
I am now waiting to hear of it from other eye-witnesses,
and once I have all my material together, I hope to being
the story in a consecutive manner. {{p363}} Up to this time
no adequate history of the life of Bahá’u’lláh has been compiled.
All that we have are fragments, or a mere outline.
How I long for a man endowed with spiritual
insight, divine faith, historical imagination and intellectual
perspicacity to arise, and with patience and perseverance,
to travel through the East, collecting the proper
material, and then writing a connected history of the
life of Bahá’u’lláh! Such a man will confer an eternal
benefit upon mankind. It is a hundred times easier to
undertake a work like this at the present time, than in
the coming ages! Not only are there many people living
who have seen Bahá’u’lláh and whose stories must be
preserved, but we have amongst us ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who
has lived and traveled with his Father in all His sufferings
and wanderings and exile and imprisonment. 

### 4. Pilgrims Arrive from India, Persia and Russia 

Yesterday and today many pilgrims have arrived;
four men, two women and three children, all Zoroastrian
Bahá’ís; from the Persian Gulf, a prominent ex-governor;
from Russia, an ardent believer and from Persia an enthusiastic
youth. Those who desire to see a religious
Congress must come and stay with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
observe how these men and women of various types and
faiths appear from all parts of the world to receive
heavenly knowledge from his Bounteous Table, and to
then return to their respective homes, inspired with the
celestial Spirit. A number of us went last night to the
station to welcome our Zoroastrian brothers and sisters.
Their faces were aglow with the fire of the Love of God.
They were great, big-hearted men, with that stamp of
nobility and dignity in their faces that does not wear off.
How glad were they when they heard that the American
Bahá’ís would go to India to spread the Glorious Message! 

“We long to see them,” they said in a chorus, “we
are ready to receive them and to sacrifice our lives for
them. {{p364}} How wonderful! How wonderful! that God
has given us the mighty privilege of witnessing His
miraculous works. Are thy not our real brothers and
sisters? Al the believers in India are expecting their
arrival and will cooperate with them to the extent of
their capacity to spread the message of light and truth.” 

### 5. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Urges the Students to Practice Public
Speaking on All Subjects 

In the morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke in detail with the
students about public speaking, and emphasized the fact
that they must practice at all times, for, as the future
teachers of the Cause, it is essential to develop this God-given
faculty. They must choose various topics, physical
and spiritual, and then speak amongst themselves and
thus employ their imaginations. 

----

### RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 28, 1913. 
### 1. Farewell Words to the Students 

The Master received the students this morning. They
are going to leave tomorrow for Beirut to be there before
the opening of the College on October 5th. He reminded
them of the former Glory of Persia and of her present
decadence, and encouraged them to continue with their
studies; {{p365}} so that the confirmations of God might ever be
with them, and wished for them to be as radiant stars
on the horizon of Bahá. Afterward the Zoroastrian
believers were ushered into his presence. They were
so happy and glad because they have reached the destination
of their long journey. 

### 2. I Desire That Thou Mayst be Filled with Bahá’u’lláh 

In the course of his conversation with Mrs. Fraser, the
Master told her that he desired that she might be filled
with Bahá’u’lláh. She must concentrate all her ideas
and thoughts around the promotion of the Word of God.
Just as the cup is filled with wine, so her heart must be
overflowing with the Love of the Blessed Perfection.
Let her look at him. How from early morning till late
in the evening he is engaged in the service of the Cause.
He devotes all his time to Bahá’u’lláh. He will help
her. Whenever he sends someone to serve the Cause,
he prays in his behalf and God will assist him. Let her
rest assured that He will be with her and she will be
enabled to render great services. Let her heart be at
ease and have no fear. 

### 3. Mrs. Stannard an Earnest Bahá’í 

In the afternoon the Master was again in the garden
dictating Tablets to Mírzá Munír. Mrs. Stannard
was also permitted to be present. The Master is turning
his attention to the believers of the Orient, and the Secretaries
are kept busy copying his innumerable Tablets.
Now and then a number of Tablets are revealed for the
West, but the East is getting the lion’s share. Before
sunset, as I was walking outside of the house, I saw the
Master coming out of the rose-garden followed by a
number of believers, Mrs. Stannard and a newspaper
correspondent. {{p366}} With the latter, the Master walked away,
and I joined Mrs. Stannard and walked toward the beach.
For nearly an hour we sat on the sand, watching the sea,
and speaking about the Cause, and its future progress.
She is a wonderful Bahá’í and the Master always praises
her sincerity, her broad vision and her unfailing energy
in many directions. 

This being the last night, the students and resident
Bahá’ís had a farewell meeting, and addresses were delivered
both in Persian and English. Each one was
followed by a Bahá’í song. We were singing and talking
until late in the evening. 

### 4. An Address Delivered to the Students 

“My dear Bahá’í Brothers! During the last few days,
through the kindness of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá we have been
brought together. We have lived under one roof, sat
around one table and associated together in the spirit
of love and unity. I cannot express to you adequately
how much I was impressed by your earnestness and true
friendship. The memory of these days as well as of the
days spent with your companions who constituted the
first party, will ever live in my mind. We cannot gainsay
one thing and that is, that the Fire of the Love of Bahá’u’lláh
is burning in the heart of each one of you. God
through His Grace has chosen you from amongst the
people of Persia and has crowned your heads with
the diadem of Faith! This is the highest privilege in the
kingdom of Abhá! Undoubtedly you must have been
worth the reception of this spiritual Gift. In this
day only those who are pure in heart, are enrolled in the
invincible ranks of the army of God. {{p367}} By this you can
easily see that each one of you is a soldier and must be a
courageous one, ready at any instant to give up his life
for the sake of the Cause. Bahá’u’lláh is your Commander-in-chief,
and from the invisible world he is continually
reinforcing you with the powers of the Holy
Spirit. Your artillery is the principles of the Cause,
your cannon the love of God, your rifles the divine
Teachings and your defenders the angels of the Supreme
Concourse. In your hearts is the love of humanity, on
your lips is the word of “Ya Bahá-El-Abhá,” in your
hands is the sword of light. Before you there is no defeat,
behind you there are glorious victories, and upon all
sides you are surrounded by the Confirmations of God.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has instructed you and has inspired your
hearts with the mysteries of self-sacrifice. He is looking
toward you with wistful tenderness, expecting that each
one will become a great teacher in the Cause. From a
physical standpoint you are the citizens of Persia, but
from a spiritual standpoint, you are the citizens of the
kingdom of Abhá which means the citizens of the world.
Consequently, although Persia has a claim on you, the
world has a greater claim. 

“You are all aware of the fact that through the Revelation
of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh a new spirit of
brotherhood is abroad, leavening all the degrees of society
and enlarging the horizon of the human intellect.
Naturally, then, every Bahá’í is called upon to contribute
his share to this general awakening and once you are
out of the campus of your Alma Mater, you will be called
upon to gird up the loins of endeavor and to spread
among the present day religions and nations, that spirit
of tolerance and freedom from prejudices which is so
much needed. 

“I can never forget the day in Washington when
‘Abdu’l-Bahá called on the Ambassador of Turkey. {{p368}} He
was sitting near the window watching the men and
women in the street. At the time a young negro, as
black as coal, passed by. <q class="abd">‘Did you see that young
negro?’</q> he asked. ‘Yes’ I answered. <q class="abd">‘I declare by Bahá’u’lláh
that I wish him to become as radiant as the shining
sun.’</q> This example will show you how ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
anxious, and how he is working day and night — so that
all mankind may advance daily along the degrees of
spiritual and intellectual activities, every marching upward. 

“We must polish the mirrors of our hearts, we must
make ourselves more receptive for the appearance of the
hidden virtues of the world of humanity, otherwise, we
will not be confirmed in the accomplishment of universal
services. 

“In his recent addresses and Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
repeatedly emphasized the principle of teaching the
Cause, of awakening those who are asleep, of bestowing
sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf and life to the
dead! Today, this is the greatest Service in the Cause
of God. This is of paramount importance and must
not be overlooked. In other parts of the world, East
and West, North and South, the friends of God are
doing their best to spread the Glad-tidings of the
Kingdom. I know full well that for the present teaching
in Syria, Turkey and Egypt is not allowed, but you
can do one thing, and that is to prepare yourselves for
the time to come. When a nation determines to go to
war, the commissary department will make definite plans,
fill the arsenals with powder and cartridges and keep
the magazines will supplied with food. Therefore you
must be always ready for war, the kind of war that
destroys ignorance, wipes away spiritual prejudices and
shatters the forces of darkness. Let us acquire knowledge,
more knowledge and yet more knowledge; {{p369}} for that
which decreases ignorance and increases wisdom is acceptable
in the sight of the Lord! 

“Personally I have done little in the Cause, but during
my stay in America I have learned one thing and that
is, that the more one learns the greater is his ignorance.
However, in this Supreme Dispensation, Bahá’u’lláh
has promised us that, as we arise to serve the Cause
spiritual Confirmations will come to our assistance and
from all sides the doors of God’s Graces will be opened
before our eyes. Consequently, our trust is in the Lord
of Hosts. We must at all times turn our hearts toward
the Kingdom of Abhá and rest assured that all our ideals
will be realized as long as our aim is to promulgate the
Cause and to scatter the teachings abroad. 

“After the lapse of a few hours, you will return to
college scenes and life which no doubt you cherish and
love, but a few of us will yet stay here, near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
to learn more of the lessons of selflessness, renunciation,
holy enthusiasm, firmness and severance from all else
save God. 

“You are laden not only with the jewels of his words
but your memory will be refreshed by the wafting of
the Breeze of his presence. We all enjoyed your association,
were stirred into cheerfulness by your ringing
Bahá’í songs and will ever remember these happy days.
May the stars of your highest hopes dawn from the
Eastern horizon! May you become true servants of
the world of humanity! May you ever strive to serve the
Cause of Universal Peace! May you be the founders
of the palace of spiritual brotherhood! May you with
one accord raise the melodious anthem of the kingdom
of Peace! May you unfurl the banner of human solidarity
and invite all mankind to enter into the shade of the
Tabernacle of eternal conciliation, Union and fraternity!” 

----

### RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 29, 1913. 
### 1. The Persian Bahá’ís Are Anxious to Know All
about the Western Bahá’ís 

Our ten students, after haring a few farewell words
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, departed for Syria, and two Kurdish
theological students of the University of Al-Azhar who
were visiting him returned to Cairo. Tomorrow our
ex-governor from the Persian Gulf will depart for
Ṭihrán with another Bahá’í via Russia. It has been a
source of great joy to come in contact with these men of
various countries and climes, who bring to us the good
news of the progress of the Cause. They are all eager
to hear of the promotion of the Bahá’í Movement in
America. What are the believers doing? Are they happy
now that the Master has been in their midst? Are they
carrying on the great work he has started? Are they
teaching new souls? Are the Western people susceptible
to spiritual emotions? Are the friends enkindled with the
fire of the Love of God? Are they going to assist us in
bringing about the Cause of Human brotherhood? Is the
light of reality shining in their hearts? Do they really
think and believe that we are their spiritual brothers and
sisters? How we long to see them and sacrifice our lives
for them! {{p371}} These are the questions they ask me one
after another, so tender in their feelings, so true in the
expression of their innermost thoughts, so beautiful in
their attitude, so wonderful in their faith! 

“Yes,” one of them told me, “I have heard that the
American Bahá’ís are spreading the Cause very strenuously,
and every night, before going to bed I pray for
them from the depth of my heart. I beg of God to reinforce
them with the angels of the Kingdom and to surround
them with universal Confirmations.” 

### 2. “Mahmal,” or the Holy Carpet 

Today “Mahmal” or the Holy Carpet was taken from
Alexandria to be carried to Mecca. It arrived from
Cairo and was paraded through the streets in a long
procession, before it reached the steamer. As the story
of “Mahmal” and its significance in the Muḥammadan
world is very important, I will later devote a few pages
to its narration, so that our Western brothers and sisters
may have a clear conception in regard to it. 

### 3. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Speaks to the Bahá’í Students before
Their Departure for College 

In his farewell talk to the students, this morning at his
own house, the Master praised God that they had come.
For many days they have been here and with perfect
joy and fragrance they associated together. These days
passed incomplete happiness. It is his hope that through
the favors of the Blessed perfection, they may finish
their studies in the college of Beirut. Let them rest assured
that they are confirmed. Many people are like
unto sheep without a shepherd. They have not protector
and no defender. But the students are the sheep and the
Blessed Perfection is their Shepherd. He is kind to His
flock. The majority of men are in great loss, but theirs
is the spiritual profit. There are many who are retrograding,
but they are progressing. {{p372}} Many trees are
withered, but they are the young plants of the orchard
of Abhá and daily they are growing in freshness and
delicacy. Others are like unto the fallen stars, but they
are rising with great brilliancy from the horizon of
Reality. 

Then he spoke about the Mahmal, and told them to
go and see it before they departed for Beirut. Their
steamer sailed at 4 o’clock P.M. 

### 4. Mírzá Jalál and Wife Arrive from London 

The Master and his family were surprised and delighted
to welcome, unexpectedly, Mírzá Jalál and his
wife. I have just heard this news. Tomorrow I will
see him, and no doubt he will tell us of his experiences
after our departure from Paris. Sometime ago I had
a letter from London telling me that they were visiting
some believers there. 

### 5. All the Pilgrims Gone and the House Seems
Deserted 

It is now late and I am writing these few words. I
look all around the room and there is no trace of last
night’s party of students. I do not hear their songs.
They are all gone. I may meet them again or I may not.
Everything is in the hands of a higher Power. He
brings us together and then separates us, but an indelible
impression is left on the pages of memory which will last
during a lifetime. After all, we are travelers in this
world. We stay a few days in this Caravanseri, but the
home of our spirits is the world of light. 

----

### RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER 30, 1913. 
### 1. The Procession of Mahmal in Alexandria 

Yesterday the Beloved ordered a number of us to go
to Alexandria and see the gorgeous procession, carrying
the Mahmal to Mecca. When we arrived, the main
avenues through which the Mahmal was going to pass
were thronged with thousands of Arabs — men and
women and children, dressed in all the picturesque colors
of the East. Egyptian soldiers and mounted guards
kept the crowd in order. Although we could rent chairs
in the front row by paying the royal sum of “two cents
and a half,” we preferred to mix with the holiday makers....
We had to wait two hours in the sun before
the head of the procession appeared. It is popularly believed
that whosoever touches the Mahmal, God’s blessings
will descend upon him and his family. For this reason,
there is always the fear that the crowd, in a burst of religious
zeal, will gather around the Mahmal and in the
confusion, trample many people under their feet. 

Therefore the Government had ordered several regiments
of soldiers to stand along the sidewalks, their rifles
pointed at the crowd, who, enthused at the sight of the
Mahmal, were singing Pilgrims’ songs. The other day
I was reading a book on the customs and manners of
modern Egyptians. In one chapter the author gives an
interesting account of this historic event and here I will
quote a few extracts bearing on the subject: —

### 2. Mahmal a Great Annual Event 

“One of the greatest events of the year in Egypt is
the starting of the Holy Carpet for Mecca. {{p374}} As regularly
as the month of fasting comes to a joyful end in the
Bairam Feast, the populace begin to look forward to the
festival of the Mahmal, as not only marking the time
of the setting off of the pilgrims to the Holy City, but
as an event of great moment to all men religiously inclined,
especially to the poor who have few hopes of
making the journey themselves.... 

“A surprising fact, if one did not know the East, when
one learns that the cost of the Pilgrimage Caravan of the
Egyptian Mahmal is no less than L250,000 a year, mostly
borne by the State, including the gifts sent to Arabia
with it. My first interest was whetted by the permission
given to visit the place where the Holy Carpet is woven
every year and where the Mahmal and the beautiful door
coverings and other sacred decorations are embroidered.
‘this is a government place,’ the boy told me at the
gate with courteous welcome, ‘but it is kept under separate
rule, and is not accessible as other government offices
are.’ I turned to listen to the melodious voice of a
<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> reading the Qur’án in a balcony overlooking the
courtyard. ‘Ours is the only place where under the
government’s supervision the Holy Qur’án is read. This
place is as sacred as a Mosque during all the time of the
year.’ We were taken at once to a long room to see the
spinning looms, where the raw yellow silk is prepared
before being dyed. Next we saw the actual weaving of
the Carpet — how it ever came by such a name cannot be
imagined when one has seen it. In reality, of course,
it is the outer cover of the Kaaba, and the name ‘Carpet’
is never applied to it by any but the Europeans, who
persist in so naming it; {{p357}} and what is curious, who think
at the same time, that the Mahmal, which is a camel
palanquin, really goes to Mecca with a carpet inside it,
and brings it back to Cairo. Tourists who think they
are seeing the Holy Carpet’s return see only the Mahmal,
coming back, as it went, quite empty. 

### 3. Qur’án Verses Woven in Mahmal 

“It would be better to speak of the holy ‘Curtains’ of which
there are eight used in the complete covering of the
Kaaba.... The curtains are black, and the art of making
them consists of weaving the Qur’án texts into the material,
also in black, with an effect like that of damask,
the lettering, which is large, being in the decorative
Arabic. The watered-silk effect of the lettering is most
striking, and in certain lights, when the cover is hung
upon the Kaaba, it can be read at a considerable distance.... 

“It was extremely interesting to be able to see and
handle the famous band which encircles the Kaaba. This
magnificent belt is about two and a half feet deep. The
following from the Qur’án, called the throne verse is
heavily embroidered on it in gold: — ‘God! There is no
God but He; the Living, the Eternal; nor slumber seizeth
Him nor sleep; His whatsoever is in the heavens, and
whatsoever is upon the earth... His Throne reacheth
over the Heavens and the Earth, and the upholding of
both burdeneth Him not and He is the High, the Great.’ 

“That the carrying of all these sacred objects connected
with the Carpet to Arabia is in itself a considerable undertaking,
was brought home to us by seeing the tents and
the waterskins and other requirements for the long
journey.... We now went into the courtyard, and the
two very fine camels — in a way held sacred too — which
are kept here solely for the purpose of conveying the
Mahmal to Mecca, were brought out for us. {{p376}} They are
of great size and of the cream color which distinguishes
the finer breeds. These animals live a secluded but
luxurious life within these precincts. By the credulous
populous all sorts of miraculous signs mark them out in
the first instance for selection to their sacred task....
A celebration took in the building under the citadel on the
night before the Kaaba hangings and the Mahmal start
for Mecca. There the Mahmal was shown and, more
interesting still, there was set up an exact model of the
Kaaba, with all the curtains hung as they appear in the
Holy City. 

### 4. Mahaml or Carpet Is a Secret Object 

“There is no religious celebration in Cairo more impressive
and beautiful than the festival, held on the eve
of the setting of the Mahmal’s Pilgrimage to Mecca.
There re other great public occasions, when the Oriental
splendor of illumination breaks out, to the thrill of the
thronging populace and the out of door excitement of
the fair are linked wit the claims of pious significance;
but this official fete in the Pavillions at the foot of the
citadel combines in equal proportions a sense of sacred
office with that of subdued entertainment, a feeling of
religious awe being curiously mingled with that of rejoicing.... 

“The real center which drew every Moslem man and
child was the Mahmal, now to be seen in pubic for the
first time since its return from last year’s pilgrimage.
Round the Mahmal men crowded; they stroked a fringe
of it, always with the right hand and then to imbibe the
blessing immediately stroked their faces while they muttered
a prayer. Little children were held up that they
might repeat the parents’ act. {{p377}} As we stood near the
Mahmal we could see seated on the floor at a short distance,
in a double row, about twenty-four men facing each
other, chanting praise of the prophet and reciting traditions
about him. At a certain point they came to an end
of chanting; all hands went up to the breast, upraised, as
a sign of silent petition... Occasionally, there came a
man who prayed with more than usual intentness and
seemed as if he could not tear himself away from the
Mahmal and others less devout would take his place,
content perhaps with a touch. 

### 5. People from All Over Egypt Come to Visit and
Touch the Mahmal 

“And why is this Mahmal, which in its material aspect
is just a camel palanquin, so intensely revered? To begin
its history at the end, there is no doubt that the reason
for this deep reverence is that the Mahmal goes to Mecca
every year exactly as a pilgrim goes, visits every spot
that the devout pilgrim visits.... 

“I can never forget a scene near the Mahmal at ‘Abbássieh,
where the Pilgrimage is eventually organized
for its actual start to Mecca. A number of poor women,
whose accent betrayed that their origin was that of Upper
Egypt, were sitting in a close group on the ground as
near the Mahmal as possible, singing very sweetly
a song of the Pilgrimage. The Lord had denied them
the privilege of praying in Mecca, but they were not
left altogether desolate, for their eyes were rejoiced by
seeing the blessed Mahmal. 

### 6. How Mahmal Was originated 

“The Mahmal dates from the 13th century, when the
first Mahmal was made by order of the Queen Shajarat-El-Dorr,
to serve for the pilgrimage which she intended
to make. {{p378}} The Queen’s name signifies ‘a tree hung with
jewels’ and the Mahmal is sometimes called by this name.
In the following year she sent the empty palanquin, as
a symbol of Egypt, and in memory of her own pilgrimage,
and from this the annual custom grew up, to be
followed by other countries, who take the occasion, as
Egypt does, to send with their Mahmal the national
tribute of money and food to the Holy City. The Court
historian told me that he thought that the custom of
sending a state symbol was older than the Queen’s
Mahmal, a special Camel termed the Mahmal, being
sent with presents to Holy Kaaba in pre-Islámic days.
The prophet himself sent such a Mahmal from Medina
to Mecca with presents. 

### 7. Many Mahmals Mentioned in History 

“Many Mahmals are mentioned in history — from
Mesopotamia, from Yaman, from India.... The old
rulers so exaggerated the importance and sacredness of
the Mahmal, that they ordered every functionary through
whose locality it passed, to kiss the foot of the Camel
bearing it until Sulṭán Kakmak prohibited what had become
a custom in the 15th century.... 

“Whe the Carpet arrives at Mecca it is handed to
<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Shelby in the presence of the chief ‘Ulamás and
notables, and kept by him till the day of sacrifice, when
it is hung upon the Kaaba. None of these holy drapings
come back to Egypt, but when they have fulfilled their
purpose they become the property of the Sherif of Mecca,
being in turn sold to pilgrims in special shops near the
Kaaba. Rich people buy the beautiful door covers and
portions of the Kaaba band. {{p379}} The poor are contented
with a shred of the black coverings.... 

“The making of a cover for the Kaaba goes back to
the time of Ignorance before Muḥammad — the first being
made of skin, and later ones of cloth, and all the tribes
of Arabia took a share in paying for it.” 

### 8. The Hardships of Bahá’u’lláh to Become the Cause
of the Awakening of the People 

For the last few days ‘Abdu’l-Bahá often spoke about
Mahmal and how people forget the spirit and cling to
the letter; that while the fountain of the salubrious water
was flowing, they were running after brackish water.
This morning when the Zoroastrian believers stood in his
presence, he asked them, what did they see yesterday?
And then gave a detailed talk on the Mahmal and its
significance. 

In the afternoon before sunset, he called at Mírzá
Abu’l-Faḍl, and a number of friends, both Arabs and
Persians were present. He talked on the severe trials
and vicissitudes of Bahá’u’lláh, when he was exiled
from Ṭihrán to Ba<u>gh</u>dád and the hardships the party
accompanying Him, had to go through. He hoped the
results of those hardships would be the illumination
of the world of humanity and the emancipation of men from
the defects of the animal nature.

### RAMLEH, EGYPT, SEPTEMBER, 1913. 
### 1. What It Means to Be with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

To be with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, {{p380}} to taste the sweetness of his
love, to drink the elixir of this affection, and to be intoxicated
with the wine of his tenderness — is to be immersed
in an ocean of spiritual lights; for is he not the
essence of sweetness, the rose-garden of love, the source
of affection, and the dawning-place of truth? 

From the unattainable attitude and the unsearchable
height of the heart, hidden beyond the mountains of his
spiritual world, flow rivers of divine grace, broad and
noble. And with majestic beauty and mystic light — these rivers ran through the arid land of the souls of
humanity, causing miraculous transformations. Where
formerly were thorns and briers, now there are hyacinths
and violets; ;where before were wild jungles, now there
are cultivated orchards; where in times gone by thee
was sterility, ow there is fertility. 

Like unto the rain, the Words fall from the heaven
of his mind, creating thousands of rills and streamlets,
and these in turn converging toward one center and
impelled by a common interest, make a mighty river, on
the banks of which a heavenly civilization is developing.
This celestial river flows through many deserts, always
with the same effect of changing them into fragrant gardens,
wherein the flowers of friendship and mutual helpfulness
blossom, perfuming the nostrils of all those who
are far and near. 

These days in Ramleh and with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! Ah, me!
How divinely spiritual! These are days touched with
Promethean fire; — days taken out of the calendar of
heaven; {{p381}} days flooded with the rays of the Sun of Reality:
days blessed by the tender and loving presence of our
Beloved and made significant and ever memorable by
the revelation of holy tablets for the friends of the East
and the West! 

Daily he breathes into the half conscious body of the
world the Breath of the Holy Spirits: — reinforcing the
visitors with heavenly Confirmation, vivifying them
with the principles of righteousness. He receives the
devotees of all religions; shoulders the burdens of all his
people and welcomes the adherents of every sect with a
beatific smile. In his presence all are welcome. The
sun of his Love pours upon all humanity, illumines the
chambers of every heart and ennobles the ambition of
every soul. He is not the respector of persons but the
lover of quality. If a man is a beggar but has a pure
heart, he loves him more than a king in royal robes, surrounded
by courtiers. 

### 2. The Students Consist of a Large Delegation 

As there is quite a large delegation of students and
as they are to be the honored guests of the Master, he
decided to divide them into two parties. The first party
have come and gone. They stayed about ten days, received
the benedictions of the Beloved, listened to his
daily words and illumined their eyes by beholding his
countenance. Then with songs of praise on their lips
and paens of thanksgiving in their hearts, they left for
Haifa that they might be ready to enter the College. 

The second party has just arrived and will no doubt
stay as many days as the Master wishes them to be here.
The boys are from 12 to 25 years old. They live together,
and the bond of Bahá’í love and good fellowship
is strong and unbreakable between them. Unquestionably,
they will not only form an invulnerable force for
liberalism in Persia, but they will become the invincible
army of the kingdom of Abhá, and with the sword of
love put to rout the forces of darkness and banish the
ghosts of ignorance. {{p382}} They have consecrated their lives
to the service of the Cause and once their zeal and enthusiasm
shake hand with knowledge and experience,
they will carry the flag of “Ya Bahá-El-Abhá” to the
furthermost corners of the earth. They have set their
ambition very high and have made up their minds to
attain to it. What would be the effect of the accumulated
result of science and experience, if they were not devoted
to the propagation of the Cause of Abhá, which
is the Cause of universal Peace, international brotherhood,
and spiritual civilization? 

### 3. The Students Sing Mrs. <u>Sh</u>ahnáz Waite’s Anthems 

Every one of the students studies and speaks English;
they sing Bahá’í songs and the anthems of Mrs.
Waite, which are translated into Persian verses by two
of the great Bahá’í poets resident in Ṭihrán. These anthems
they sink with great feeling; and all over the
East, the poems of our “American nightingale,” as the
believers affectionately call Mrs. Waite in their poetic
language, are sung by young men and women. She is
loved and honored, because she is the poetic voice of the
far West, crying in the wilderness of cold skepticism and
summoning the people to the banquet of Bahá’í Peace
and Love. how happy she would be — how grateful she
would become, how her eyes would be filled with tears
of joy if she could listen for one moment to the melodious
voices of these Eastern brothers, singing her songs
with true understanding and sympathy! 

### 4. Happiness and Tranquillity of Heart 

In order to bring my remarks to an end, I will share
with you, the outline of two talks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá given
to these students. 

On one occasion, he stated that they are welcome to
Ramleh. {{p383}} Are they happy? If they are not happy, then,
in this wide world, who could claim happiness? Happiness
is the most natural possession and immanent attribute
of every Bahá’í. Praise be to God that they are free
from every tie, are engaged in the study of spiritual and
physical sciences and are beneath the protection of Bahá’u’lláh.
god is with them, for they are not holding any
thought which leads to intemperance and temptation. 

The heavy-burdened people are afflicted with a hundred
thousand sorrows and griefs and are at all times influenced
and made unhappy by the changing conditions of life. In
this world the greatest gift of God is the tranquillity of
the heart, especially when such a heart becomes the abiding
place of the Love of God. This is the highest attainment
in the world of creation! 

But if, on the other hand, a man has all the wealth,
comfort and luxuries of life, and does not possess tranquillity
of heart, all these things will become conducive
of anxiety and nervous breakdown. When the tree
is firmly rooted in the earth, no matter how much the hurricane
rages, the furious winds blow and the rushing rains
fall, this will only add to the firmness and verdancy of
the tree, and it will loom toward the heavens with
greater confidence and assurance. But if its root is not
firm, even though the sun pours down, the winds blow,
the rains descend and the breezes waft, — there will be no
foliage, no branch, no blossom and no fruit. 

Now praise be to God, that the hearts of the believers
are tranquil and assured in the Favors and bounties of
the Blessed perfection. What bestowal is greater than
this? {{p384}} No matter what affliction may befall upon us, the
heart is in the utmost tranquillity, serene and full of rejoicing.
We can withstand all kinds of afflictions and
resist all manner of persecutions with imperturbable courage
and faith. Those souls who are under the shade of
the Cause of God, if they are not shaken and agitated,
will advance through the infinite degrees of perfection.
There is a vast difference between the bird which is already
imprisoned in the cage, and the bird which after
being set at liberty, is caught again in the net through
its own negligence. 

### 5. Lasting Enjoyment Is for the Moral Man 

In speaking to the students on another occasion, he
stated, that, when the heart is confident, man knows
that all is well. At one time in ‘Akká, thirteen Bahá’ís
lived in one room, but they radiated peace, joy and love.
Praise be to God, that they have come to Ramleh and
stayed with him for nine days. They associated with
one another and became his intimates. Their presence
gave him much happiness. Likewise, they have spent
many memorable days on Mount Carmel and in the
vicinity of the tombs of Bahá’u’lláh and the Blessed Báb.
Now they are going to return, but let them rest assured
that these experiences have been permeated with ideal results
and the invisible Confirmation shall ever descend
upon them. 

It is his hope that they will study with persistence
and perseverance. He is well satisfied with their conduct
in the College of Beirut. Truly they have borne themselves
with urbanity and dignity. May they ever become
better, sweeter, more perfect and more accomplished!
In this path lies life’s enjoyment. {{p385}} The success
and pleasure of this physical life lies in uprightness!
What a difference exists between those souls who live
in accord with the good-pleasure of the Lord and those
who are guided by their own thoughts and self-interests!
The former are always attracted always enkindled, always
immersed in the sea of God’s Favors, always thinking
of the well-being of humanity, always joyful and
humble! 

When you reflect carefully, you will observe that real
and lasting contentment is in the possession of the moral
man. Some may imagine that because they frequent
theaters, accumulate wealth, or attend balls, they are
always enjoying life; whereas, in reality, these things
often scatter thoughts, confuse the minds and dissipate
the faculties. The effect of these amusements is like the
effect of the wine upon the body; — it exhilarates at first,
but its after effect leaves one weak and the mental faculties
exhausted. But the man who is chaste and moral
receives his strength from the hidden spring of the universe;
he is stirred continually by the Divine Glad-tidings;
he is spiritual and godlike. 

Praise be to God that their life is directed by ethical
laws and molded by moral principles. He hopes that
day by day their dignity and composure may increase;
that they may strive with greater exertion in their studies;
that the spring of their beatitude and happiness may gush
forth unfailingly. The assistance of Bahá’u’lláh is with
them and they shall precede all other students in their
works. 

### 6. The Meaning of Faith 

Faith does not mean acknowledgment and mere confession.
Faith means that one’s conduct and behavior,
one’s character and life be in accord with the divine
teachings. This is the quintessence of Faith. {{p386}} The greatest
bestowal of the world of existence is a tranquil heart,
and it is impossible to obtain a tranquil heart save through
the good-pleasure of the Lord; i.e.; man should so adorn
the temple of his being with lofty attributes and philanthropic
deeds as to be pleasing at the Threshold of the
Almighty. There is no other path! Consider the condition
of kings, ministers, captains of industry and the
leaders of mankind! Looking at them from the superficial
standpoint, you would think their hearts to be in the utmost
composure, joy and peace; but if you reflect carefully,
you will observe, that they live in great agitation,
surrounded with haunting fears and griefs. They do
not enjoy one moment of ease and rest! 

### 7. The Basic Principle of the Good-Pleasure of God 

The point is this: let all their thoughts, their ideals,
and aims revolve day and night around one common object,
and that is: — to live in accord with the good-pleasure
of the Lord. Then all the doors of felicity will
be opened before their faces, they will be successful in
all their undertakings and will become confirmed in all
their accomplishments. The basic principle is the good-pleasure
of God and the good-pleasure of God is obtained
through the tranquillity of the heart and the tranquillity
of the heart is obtained by living in accord with the divine
teachings and exhortations. 

When a person attains to this station, he is contented
and peaceful. Then he will become prosperous in all
affairs. This station is joy succeeded by joy, confidence
after confidence and paradise after paradise. Thus we
read in the blessed Qur’án: — O thou assured soul! turn
to thy Lord, confident and well-satisfied. If thou dost
associate with my true servants, it is as though thou hast
entered paradise. {{p387}} Having attained to this exalted station,
man lives in paradise, although walking upon the
earth; he lives in paradise when he departs from this
world; his heart is ever in paradise; his spirit is in paradise;
and he is encircled by the joys of paradise! 

### 8. The Successful Student 

Consider the condition of a student who attends
school for five years and applies himself to a life of
study. If at the time of examination he is not successful,
he will become extremely despondent. He is living
in a hell of despondency. But if, on the other hand, he
passes examination with success, he is honored and beloved
on all sides; receives his degree with pride and
achieves great distinction in the world of humanity. In
other words, he is living in a Paradise of fulfillment. 

The students must therefore, strive so that, they may
become thoroughly grounded in science and arts. Let
them ever be thoughtful, supplicating, and entreating
before God. Then when they are attending their classes,
heavenly confirmations will uninterruptedly descend upon
them. 

The foundation of life is morality. They must exert
themselves to improve continually the moral side of their
nature. If the morals of man are merciful, although he
may not be a great scholar, yet will his character be
loving: but if his morals are corrupt, even though he
be a master of sciences, he will be a harmful agency in
the body politic. Instead of becoming the cause of
illumination of the world of humanity, he will become
conducive to its darkness. Instead of helping the Cause
of general construction, he will materially further the
ends of destruction. Instead of adding to his energy
for the cause of progress, he will enlist himself on the
side of the cause of decline. {{p388}} On the other hand, if his
character is merciful and he is also well grounded in
sciences and arts — then, he will be light upon light. 

### 9. Light and Knowledge 

Here the Beloved paused for a few moments, and then
gave a wonderfully, illuminative interpretation of a verse
in the Qur’án, which is known as the “verse of Light.”
In phrase after phrase, he elucidated the Qur’ánic words
in the most comprehensive manner under the significance
of knowledge. He closed his remarks with the statement,
that, it is evident that light is knowledge. If the
light is shining in a black and sooty lamp, it will not
shed any radiance; but if the light abides in a transparent
glass — in other words, if knowledge abides in a clear
heart, imbued with merciful morality, characterized with
faith, assurance and holiness, enkindled with the fire of
the love of God and attracted by the Fragrances of God,
such a heart will become a center for the outpouring of
divine Bestowals and this will be light upon light! 

### 10. Letter to the Students from the President
of College 

I may quote herein a letter written to the Persian students
by president Howard S. Bliss of the Beirut College.
The letter is written on Board S. S. Royal Mail Steamship
Pannona and mailed from New York, dated April
14, 1913: — 

“TO THE PERSIAN STUDENTS:

“DEAR FRIENDS:

“Before landing in New York, which we hope to do
tomorrow, I wish to send you a special word of greeting
and thanks for your very kind letter of farewell. {{p389}} I appreciate
your thoughtful kindness very deeply and it has
been a great pleasure to re-read your letter. We
had, a long but pleasant journey. We are now eager to
see land and to receive word from loved ones in Syria.
Of course this includes the College and all the students.
I hope that the Persian students will have a prosperous
ending to their years and all may be planning to return.
I hope also that you may have addition to your numbers
and that the good record that you have had during the
past may be continued. I always look forward to returning
to the campus which we love so ardently. My
love goes to each one of you. Your president 

(Signed) “HOWARD S. BLISS.”  {.sig}

Thus the East and the West join hands of communication!
And these students, because they are acquiring material
and spiritual sciences will be the greatest links of
unity between America and Persia. 

May they succeed as they have already succeeded
all their undertakings! 

### 11. The Bahá’í Cause as Interpreted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 

The Bahá’í Cause as lived and interpreted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
is a clarion call for the unification of the people
of the Orient and the Occident. It is a light to lead the
storm-tossed travelers to the haven of peace and brotherhood.
Millions of people all over the world are praying
for the coming of the day when truth will reign and the
clouds of prejudices will be dispelled from men’s consciousness. 

We as the followers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are able to inspire
these men and women with words of encouragement and
examples of unselfish service. {{p390}} Let us unfurl the flag of
the religion of God and gather in its shade all those who
desire to enlist their names in the invincible army of the
kingdom of Abhá. Our supreme Commander is Bahá’u’lláh;
our General is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; our rule is the Word
of God; our guide is the power of the Holy Spirit; our
aim is to establish upon the earth the dominion of heaven;
our hope is to defeat the soldiers of ignorance and fanatacism;
our resolution is to make this world the paradise
of the Almighty and our purpose is to gain victory for
the forces of Justice, Truth and Liberty. 

We as Bahá’ís have no other ambition, no other desire
and no other plan. Let us fill the hearts with gladness;
illumine the souls with the light of the Sun of Reality;
refresh the minds with the breezes of the garden of universal
Ideals and sing the thrilling anthem of the Union
of the inhabitants of the East and of the West, of the
North and of the South! 

THE END

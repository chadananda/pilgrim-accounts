Dear Harries!

Ours is a heavenly day, a day for the coming of which the prophets dreamed and prophicies to awaken the future generations. Their golden visions; have illumined the darkness of many lives and their inspiring verses have strived as heaven lights of half to the benighted humanity throughout cautious and cycles. We are living in a period the battle cry of which is universal Peace and the unity of the human race. May this day star arise from the horizon of the hearts! May this water gush forth from the fount of truth! May these delicate {{p2}} fragrances be diffused all around. May this divine table be spread before all the people!

This morning Haji Ameen, his two Persian companions. Imirza Valliallali Khan and his brother came to see our Beloved. He inquired about the condition of the Persian believers and was pleased to hear their good news, that they are united and agreed. It seemed the trip of the Master in America and its reports have created a tremendous effect all over the East and the number of the believers {{p3}} had been greatly increased. So much interested in the Cause had arisen that lately a meeting was arranged in Teheran in a large hall, fronting a most beautiful garden where more than one thousand people were present Bahais and man Bahais. At this meeting the like of which has never been organized in Persia speeches were delivered and addresses of Ahdul Baha read. It caused a great sensation amongst the outsiders and brought the Cause before the eyes of the public, creating much discussion and arousing real interest {{p4}} beautiful bouquet of red roses and white lilies was brought with the heartfelt greeting of Miss Sauderson and her mother.

The Master asked Mirza Mohamaud to chant the prayers of Baha'u'llah and the soft law, musical chanting of our brother made us forget our Western surroundings while the Eastern contemplative mature carried us back to the home of light there, to commune with the creator.

After this sacred silence of the mystical life, we returned {{p5}} to the busy world and cabbprous were dispatched to many countries announcing the safe arrival of Our Beloved in Paris.

With Miss Sanderson these came Mr. Eric G.A. Julihn, an artist who comes from San Francisco and for the last two years he has living in Europe. He has accepted Bahai Cause through Mrs. Helen Goodall. He was going back to the States tomorrow. These facts were presented to the Master and he dictates a Tablet and sent it with the artist for Mrs. Goodall, Mrs. Ella Cooper and Mrs. Ralston.

{{p6}}

Then the Beloved said in English: Mrs. Goodall, good woman; good lady; Very good, very nice, very beautiful. I speak for you English, but I don't speak English. Then through me he continued:

{{p12}}

About noon the Master with all the Persians went out to have a walk and after return we had lunch. There are 12 Persians at the Table and it looked like, Persia transplanted in Paris. The Master reminded us of the Bounties and Favors of Baha'u'llah who has confirmed this Cause to be spread in France and who has gathered us here with the utmost joy and Fragrance. We must therefore thank the Blessed Perfection for these divine gifts and treasures and arise to serve him with {{p13}} zeal and firmness. After an hour of rest, several Persian dropped in to pay their homage to the King of Kings. Amongst there was a well Known prince. (Nastrated Double) The Master spoke to him about his trip in America how he travelled through large cities from Coast, how he addressed large gatherings in churches and before Peace Societies.

The young man who was returning to America comes to say farewell to our Beloved. He told him: now that you are returning to America, pass through all {{p14}} the large cities on the way; meet the friends of God and associate with them. Tell them that at present Abdul Baha has no time for letter writing. It is his hope that all the friends will arise in the service of the Cause; that they will live in accord with the Teachings of Baha'u'llah and the contacts of Abdul Baha's addresses; so that these Teachings may not become like unto the Bible, unfulfilled. All the friends much become the living embodiment of these Teachings; otherwise they will not avail. 

{{p15}}

Abdul Baha asked me to go with him and call on Mrs. and Miss Sanderson. They live very near this hotel in the Rue de Malacoff. First Mrs. Sanderson and later Miss daughter came to the reception room. The Master told Mrs. Sanderson how she was renewed in Mimeapalis in the house of her daughter as Miss Sanderson speaks and understands Persian; Our Beloved spoke with her in that language saying that He was most pleased with her, for he has witnessed a condition in her which was full of future promise. Two things were necessary for spiritual progress: One, detachment from this world and the other, attraction with the Fire of the Love of God. Mrs. Sanderson told the Master about a dream she has had in which she saw someone like the Master came to her and comforted her. Since that time she has been much happier. He hoped, the Master said that she shall attain to such happiness which was eternal {{p17}} and unchangeable. After some observations on the fidelity of daughter to mother he returned to his oven apart. About half past nine Our Beloved called me into his oven room and till hast midnight warriors subjects were discussed. Amongst the many anecdotes which he told me about the days of Baha'u'llah, I like to tell you two of them.

Once Mohammad Ali thought in a public way show his priority over Abdul Baha. 

{{p19}}

In these days the Blessed Perfection lived in the Palace of Bahaji, and Abdul Baha lived in Acca Mohamad Ali living in Bahaji. Our Beloved often called on Baha'u'llah and always as a sign of respect sat near the door. Now Mohamad Ali thought if on one of these occasions he should outer the room and see the Master sitting near the door (and if there were many believers standing,) he would sit above the Master, so that before the eyes of all but superiority would be established. One day he entered the {{p19}} room and the Master was sitting as usual near the door. Baha-ollah, giving him permission to sit he went right above the Master and sat down. When the Blessed Perfection observed this, with His own hands he made up him Let up and take another seal.

On another accasion one of the Bahai warmer after much pleading and insisting Kissed the Master's hands in the Presence of Baha-ollah. Mohamad Ali and rest blamed her Several, telling her that She had made a grear mistake, to kiss the hands of anybody else before Baha-ollah. Then Baha-ollah hearing {{p20}} about this called the Bell woman to him and said to her everybody; I am very pleased with you because in my Presence their didst manifest thy devotion and respect to the Master. Thus the hours rolled on. The Master speakking words of wisdom and counsels and About halfpast eleven faithful Layad Assa dallah brought in Our Beloved supper.

Afterwards he gave me permission to go and sleep; but I was thinking and rejoicing at the Bounties of the Master and am new writing you this so that you to be gladdened with the glad tidings of the Kingdom.

Love to all Ahmad

{{p5}}

of life, such as animals, birds etc. to illustrate this I desire to tell you a story.

There is a community in Syria called Baktashi who believe in this school. One day in Acca, we were gathered in an open space, and then was a judge present; One of these Baktashi was with us. Observing a donky near by her ran towards it and put his mouth to his ear. From the face of the man one would have imagined that he was holding a serious conversation. Having finished his talk with the donkey he put his ear to the donkey's mouth, and strange enough the animal began to move his mouth. After this strange proceeding he cause towards us. The judge asked the man "What were you saying to the donkey?" "I was talking with him about a serious matter" he answered. "What was it?" "Then you must tell us about it."-"It is impossible" For some moments the judge insisted and the man still refusing to tell the secret finally he demanded imperiously what form he enjoyed in his former incarnation" -" What was the answer" asked the judge more and more excited - "O! the donkey said that he was formerly a judge" was the reply. The judge got so angry that had not the man run away he would almost have had him killed.

But to speak seriously it is a scientific fact that the elements which make up the body of man are endistructable. They will return again to the animal and {{p6}} mineral kingdoms - The animal is eaten again by man and it is transformed into the body of man. This is an endless circle.

It is an established fact that Man travels through these various kingdoms. The indivisible atom in the mineral kingdom appears through infinite changes, and in each change it manifests a peculiar virtue. - Having perfected its journeys through the mineral kingdom it ascends to the vegetable kingdom - Again in the vegetable  kingdom this indivisible atom manifests itself throughout all the different varieties of plant life, and having again finished its experiences in this kingdom it will appear in the animal kingdom - Here again we observe the same process of assisted relation and perfecting until it ascends to the human kingdom. This will show you that every atom which has gone into the makeup of your body has had its previous experiences throughout the lower kingdoms of life and has manifested itself through infinite grades and forms. For example the atoms which are a fast of this flower will someday appear in other flowers: then they return again to the vegetable life. Therefore the primordial atoms of this flower may have gone through many changes - now it is a flower and later on it may be an animal. In short it goes through the make-up of infinite forms and in each form it {{p7}} is adorned with a special virtue. cause greatly there is a philosophical statement that "all things are involved in all things" This is an exposition of divine philosophy.

Now to come to the question of the return "which is spoken of in Holy Scriptures". For example His Holiness, the Christ said that John the Baptist is Elias and when they asked of John he said " No. I am not Elias." Though outwardly these two contradicted each other, however in reality they did not, because that effulgent reality which is absolute and which appeared in all the prophets of God appeared likewise in John the Baptist. That is: the same virtues which were in the farmer appeared in the later. - in other words the genuine idea and not the specific idea appeared in that special temple. For example the qualities of cabour, fragrance, and beauty which were in the flower of last year are returned in the flower of this year, so you may say that the flower has returned. Again the light which {{p8}} shone in the lamp last night in the same light which is shining in the lamp of tonight although the lamp may have changed.

In this station we do not look upon these outward limitations but we ever look at the appearances of the identical virtues of that eternal reality, has always shone forth from the dawning-places of truth and will always shine from the horizons of the Prophets of God.

Dear Harriet!

A piece of rock in the hands may be heavy, but a speck of dust in the eyes may end in blindness. The believers of God are the eyes of the world. These eyes must be well-protected so that no harm may come to them. If the eyes cannot lead the feet with that one may be directed to his destination, the whole body will be useless. The possessor of the eyes must guide those whose sights are blind. The guide must have penetrating eyes, and traps parent vision and try to assist others through the rocky, steep windings. Thus amongst the friends all {{p2}} over the world, the utmost with and accord must prevail, strong ties of love and affection binding the hearts and perfect understanding and ideal fellowship knitting them close together. The realizations of these facts will render the vision of the eyes Keener and the range of perception further. Then and not until then, a correlation of growth will be established between all the eyes. Otherwise, if there is quarrel or even ill-feeling between the friend clouds of dust will be raised, the eyes will be affected and they will become unable to perform their mission as guides and thus the statement of Christ will be true of them: "Blind leaders of blind."

{{p3}}

This morning after breakfast, many Persians arrived and entered the Presence of the Beloved. Mirza Mahmaud Chanted some of the prayers of Blessed Perfection, thus calming the spirits and idealizing the real.

Referring to Zoroastrian Ardeshirjy who called without the Master while in London Abdul Baha said that Zoroastrians do not Know that the source of all awakens and advancement is the Tablets of Baha-o-llah which were revealed about 55yrs ago. As soon as those words were uttered {{p4}} their conditions were changed and they become more esteemed in the eyes of the people.

The newspapers were read to Our Beloved, giving the news that Turkey has ceded Adria nople to the Bulgars. The Master quoted the prophecy of Baha-o-llah uttered more than fifty yrs. ago in the Tablet of the Sultan:- "Ere long the country of Adrianople shall go out of the hand of the Sultan."  

{{p5}}

All morning many private interviews were given, but the announcement cards were mailed stating the Master will arrive on January 23rd and received the friends on the 24th, excepted very few, the rest were not aware that in Paris we have been {{p6}} for the last three days and so we shall see all the friends tomorrow. This morning Miss George whose mother is an excellent Bahai brought some very wonderful symbolical pointing. There were two canvases called "the path of life". One was pointed two very etherial maids with their hairs flowing in the winds, behind their backs. They were walking in an enchanting sylvan wood. In the hand of rich, one observed a lamps, shedding its rays on the path. Their faces radiated peace, serenity and assurance. They walked with {{p7}} steady feet, and with the assistance of their lanterns they detects all obstacles in their path and quickly avoide them. The background of the picture was very lovely, tall green trees, ascending heavenward, birds perching in the branches were singing the songs of light and love. The light in the lanterns,  we told is the symbol of the human intelligence which guides man to higher summits of Reality. The other canvas contained many pictures. The background was rocky, full of crags and impossible roads. Men and women, young {{p8}} and old with their lanterns in their hands and so we, having babies in their arms tried to scale these rocks. Some had dark lanterns the light of intelligence was not burning and as a result they were listen the deep recesses of the valleys. They were pitiful sights. Gloom and depression were stamped on their faces and the terrors of hopelessness and despair pictured in their every move. Side by side there were men and women whose lanterns were lit. Divine splendors emanated from countenances gaily they danced along as {{p9}} though they were walking on a flower bed. They experience no difficulty in finding their way. The lantern lighted every crummy and crevice. The thing I liked best about theme was they make you stop and look. The Master took the two paintings as the theme of his {{p10}} morning address. It was a beautiful exposition of this light which causes to the mind and illumined it with the rays of the Sun of Supreme Intelligence. This lantern guided man to the virtues of the world of humanity. You will read the address at the end of the days writing Abdul Baha met and to call on Gaemmagam and from there he was invited to dine with Miss Natalie Barney. The Persians had lunch and finding an hour a two in our hand, we sailed out of the apartment and headed for the Tracaders and then the Ruier Leine. Right at the {{p11}} foot of Eiffel tower we took a look and after a few minutes reached the Station as Invalides and the majni friends feridge of Alexander. From there we visited the tomb of Napoleon. It was a glorious tribute to that military Jewis. Silently we walked around, looked down the tomb, and walked back home. It was about 5 o'clock when we returned. The Master had already arrived and was drinking his tea.

The news of Turkey were read to him. He said:"these people are constantly being defeated {{p12}} while we are conquering all the time; we conquer the cities of the hearts and souls in Europe and America.

Mrs. Bernard, one of the Bahais came in with Miss Saunderson. The Master said: Whenever the hast expects the arrival of a reserve guest, he prepares a lovely table, he cooks delicious dishes and makes delightful arrangement. Now let them tell him what preparation have they made for his reception. "I am sure" Miss Saunderson that the best preparations are the ready hearts which have been waiting to receive you."  

{{p13}}

Well said, the Beloved rejoined "The Parisian people are submerged in a sea of materialism. They are intoxicated with the wine of desire and selfish appetites. They think these material objects are permanent. They put their trust in them while all such things are subject to change. Today the Palaces of the Ancient Kings are destroyed. The fishermen dry their nets on the ruined walls and the owls are making their nests in the cornices. It is his hope that they may enkindle such a lamp in Paris so as to make this city radiant.

{{p14}}

Man must lay the foundation of such a palace which may stand the encroachments of time, which day unto day may become newer and its imperial pinnacles may reach to the height of heaven. Mauscein Dreyfus coming in, said, that a bag of tea had arrived but he had forgot to bring with it. The Master said: Never mind! Bring for us the Kind of tea whose exhilaration may be eternal for the exhilaration of that tea is only for a few minutes. Mon. Dreyfus answered: "We need a special {{p15}} Kind of Samawar for this tea, "I trust" the Beloved rejoined quickly "the Samawar of this tea will be Paris." Maayoral Mamalell and a Seutteran from the Persian Euhassy cause in on the port of the Ambassador to pay their hawed to the Master. 

Much discussion was carried on: historical and moral, all of which touched upon the causes of the present back word condition of Persian and Turkey. It is marvelous to bear {{p16}} so much wisdom from the lips of the Beloved. From a human standpoint it is an impossible for me to remember all the infinite complexities of history, philosophy and sciences, both modern and daily explained by Abdul Baha accent. It is also astonishing to observe many nationalities and races of every trades of intelligence which go to the Master and each whether learned or illiterate was made and satisfied. Still very late of night he was speaking to a hast if Persians who are living Paris.

Love and all Ahmad

Two paintings were shown to the Master, which represented allegorical subjects - The pictures represented certain figures of women gaining through a dark wood and each figure carrying a laugh in her hand, some of the lamps were lighted enabling the bearer to walk easily on smooth ground while other lamps not-lighted did not show the way and the bearer walked with difficulty over stormy ground.

The Master said. The artist has drawer very beautiful pictures for she has painted allegorical figures on this canvas - each figure carries a canteen in the hand - the lantern of some are lighted while those of others are not and still others are only dimly lighted. In this manner she has portrayed the various stages of human development.

The light of Siudance shines brightly in the pathway of some people while the direction of others is only distinguished faintly by a feeble light- and still the way of another is entirely dark. The aim of the artist is to show by the process of reflection is illuminating his pathway and thus causing him to attain to the virtues of the world of humanity. 

{{p18}}

very great, having in themselves the latent power of igniting (or ignition) or soon as they come in touch with a flame they take fire like a torch - others have but - little capability like unto a piece of wet wood. They have the power of enkindling, but it may take some time before the wood is dry enough to light other souls are like unto the stones, if a stone is put-into the fire for a thousand years it will not burn- it has no capability of lighting.

For example we observe that the Divine Grace like the rain pours down upon the Earth. Now if this rain falls upon brackish ground nothing will grow for the soil lacks the power of producing vegetation - as long as there is not the capacity in the soil no matter how much the rain may fall on it, it will yield no result, on the other hand there is a piece of land which is good and free from blemish and as soon as the rain falls flowers and hyacinths will spring up from it. Now, reflect that notwithstanding an abundance of rain it is impossible for a withered tree to put-forth leaves because the vital energy of growth is lacking and the life-cells are dead. Therefore no matter how great is the Divine Grace yet if a man is not endowed with capability to receive it there is no result on the other hand however much the capability is great and yet the {{p19}} Divine Grace does not assist, the man will not be able to attain to the summit of perfection, for the soil, though free from blemish is in need of the downpour of the rain. These are certain souls who believe that the virtues of humanity are obtainable through the power of capability alone, but it is evident that unless the Divine Grace descends no fruit will be produces unless the sun shines, the clouds pour down it rain and Jephyr's blow, the dark soil will not be transformed into a delectable rose garden.

This will show you that capability alone is not sufficient - capability will be fruitful if it is joined with the Divine Grace and also if this divine Grace is obtained and there is no capability on the part of man there will be no harvest.

Consequently we must strive in order to obtain the capability so that this divine Grace may have its effect upon us and may reach us with its inexhaustible favours. We must make an effort - so that when thirsty we may drink with utmost relish and enjoyment this water of life, - but if a sea of fresh water is waving before us and these is no thirst in us we shall not enjoy it. If the rays of the sun flood the whole region and we are blind we cannot witness its glories. If the celestial symphony of the supreme concourse is raised and we are deaf we shall not hear it. If the sweet {{p20}} fragrances waft towards us and we have not the power of swelling what would be the use. If a most royal banquet were spread before us and we have no appetite we cannot partake of it. Consequently let us strive to obtain unlimited capabilities in order that we may enjoy these divine Graces of Baha-ollah which have encompassed the world. For His grace is all-encircling; His Clouds are facing, and the rays of His Sun are descending.

Dear Harriet!

It was one of me; The Master was walking under the Eiffel tower, which is only five minutes from our apartment and Doctor Mohamad Khan and myself followed in his fastlately. He was giving us some particulars about the life of Zoraaster; the sun was shining, the weather balmy; Seive placidly ralling 5o feet beyond. The bright of Napoleon was in sight. Frocadero in front of us; carriages and automobiles passing to and from; people here and there gaze wonderingly {{p2}} at the Master when Lo and behold there appeared before him a paralytic man in  small wheel carriage which was moved around with one hand. He was a young man, shabbily dressed, selling post cards and books of photographic views. Our Beloved's face was lighted upon he smiled the smile of heartfelt pleasure as though he was meeting a long - last friend. He exclaimed" Oh! here he is my old friend, my friend of last year, and he approached the man, the poor man was happy, and pleased. Then Our Beloved talks with him in French: "Baujiur Mousieur! Comment da votre Soute' aujourd'hui?' The man answer with an effusion of French politeness. The Master gave him money and with that heavenly smile on his faces we passed by.

{{p3}}

An article appeared today about the arrival of the Master in a Newspaper, called "Gil Blas". I wonder whether you can decipher the French idioms so copiously used. However I enclose a copy. It is about the arrival of "Foraaster". "Tomorrow a real prophet will be amongst us " thus the article begins Mrs. H.H. Ford knows French very well. She is my dear mother. Ask her to translate it for you. Mirza Azzizallah Khow knowing French, the translation of the daily news in the domain of politics and oriental events, falls upon his shoulder. Also the translations of public addresses are made by our dear {{p4}} brother Mon. Dreyfus into French, for be it known that we are living amongst the French people. This morning there occurred many interviews mostly in French which fortunately can undersatand. There was a woman from Montreal; The Master asked whether she knows Mrs. Maawell. Yes, she answered. Then the beloved speak up: In the Moutreal there are many good Bahais, many good men and women. It was arranged that every day from 10 to twelve there will be private interviews then the Master will comes out to deliver his Short public address. This being the first day that people were officially hidden to come {{p5}} the invitation cards many guests were present. There were a mucher of Americans from San Francisco.

{{p8}}

Having thus finished his eloquent address, he called me and Doctor Mohamad Khau to take a walk with him. On the way he talked on the wonders of Brooklya Bridge, the tall buildings of Newyork. He said that the people in America are like beehives. They live in their wouderful lives and work day and night without intermission.

I mentioned the fact that they have referred to him in this morning papers as "Foroaster". This gave him a {{p9}} theme of telling us the interesting rise of the prophet of Iran and his doctrines; the meaning of the two powers in man; the god of good and the god of evil - Bahman and Ahrinian. He sat on a chair under the Eiffel Tower and jokingly remarked that if all the newer of a certain nonphysical Society put their thoughts together they could now construct a tower like this for man thoughts must ever be fruitful, otherwise what result? 

{{p10}}

Arriving home and right after lunch three important Persians came to see the Master. They have played significant part in the recent events of Persia revolution. The Master spoke with them our human and divine education on his impressions of America, on the Turkish war and many stories illustrating each point and they were charmed with the Beloved.

Madame D' Ange D' Astre who is a French Bahai, but had lived many yrs. in America came to see the Master.

{{p11}}

I knew her when I lived in Washington and since that time we have been friends. She had a few minutes with the Master and I told her of the news of Our trip through W.S.

When the Master awake he sent a number of us to pay our respect to His Excellency the Persian Ministrer. He lives very near. Haji Ameen healed the delegates and when we were ushered into the drawing-room were many other Persians. For one hour {{p12}} we discussed various subjects. Tea was served and the utmost courtesy was shower to all of us. The Persian Minister who has met the Master last year expressed his love and devotion for him before all these who were present. Having expressed our thanks we left the Legation but two of the Persians followed us to see the Beloved. One of them was the ex-chief of the Police in Teheran, the other a wonderful, energetic young man who was the {{p13}} Editor of an influential daily in Teheran. This latter young man carried a line of discussion with the Master which brought forth many good points, many historical anecdotes of Persia and Turkey. The Master reviewed the history of Arabia before and after the rise of Islam, the change which Mohamad brought in their customers, and their made of life. Then rising to an untarmable height of divine feeling the thundered glorious. In the beginning of the Koran Mohamad says: - Praise be to God for He is the Lord of all the people of the world. 

{{p14}}

He did not hath not say the Lord of the Maslews on the Lord of the Christians: Now we have forgotten this foundation and are holding fast to certain invitations.

The questions of religious dogmas was brought up and again the Beloved with fire in his eyes, with hands moving, with face wreathed with lines of earnestness and cried out: - Baha-ollah in this age hath closed the doors of hell; He hath free the necks from these fetters. He hath opened the unlinoted space and hath given man white wings {{p15}} whereby to soar. Following the Master we walked to the apartment of Mous, and Mahame, Dreyfus Rue d'e Greuze where there was going to be a meeting. We welcome by a large gathering. Before the Master's talk Man Dreyfus read from a Tablet of Baha-ollah which he had trauslabs with French. The Master cause in and gave a wonderful talk on the dawn of the spiritual Sun. He hoped that if helps ever permitted to visit Paris for a third time he may obtain greater happiness {{p16}} that he may see Paris is illumined; that Paris has become the Paradise of Abha; that from Paris the Summon of the Kingdom is heard; that in Paris the stars of the Kingdom are shining. Toward the end of his glowing address. He stated that; Baha-ollah was w real divine Physicians. He diagnosed the sickness of the world of humanity. Therefore the hath prescribed quick - healing remedy. There is no other medicine for the human kind except this medicine is taken, it is evident that the world of humanity, will became luminous, the neuter world will reflect the virtues of the derived world and all humanity will attain to the utmost composure and peace.

Thus a busy day was closed with the word. "Peace" from the divine lips of our Beloved.

Love to all Ahmad  

{{p17}}

Welcome! Welcome!

I have come again to Paris so that I may see if the seed I have sown last year has spring up. Praise be to God, I can see that thy have taken root. On this account I am very happy; I hope that the cause will not remain stationary but that day by day these seeds will take firm root in the ground and that these meadows may become merchant and full of flowers. That the ideal illumination may become manifest.

Every creature is endowed with one aspect of reality - man however processes two aspects of realities - consider how these sentient beings wether they live upon the earth or in the air have only one aspect. For example: the earth, the mountain, the meadow and the desert have only one mineral aspect. Thus flowers and the trees enjoy the vegetable reality - the one vegetable aspect. These animals and the quadra possess only the animal aspect, but man has a material aspect and a spiritual aspect for man is different. His physical reality is captive to nature in on a level with the animal kingdom while the veritable man is superior to the animal - By his spiritual reality he is distinguished from them. For {{p18}} evident that if man with this small body of his in enable physically to overcome these difficulties he surmounts them by his intellect. He dries up the land, then again he floods it. He breaks through the mountains and for geological discoveries he descends into the earth. He discovers the realities of all phenomena through the power of his genius he creates all such of industries and he also brings forth delicate arts and crafts - while in Europe he discovers America, while on the earth he explores the starts in the firmAment - while in the East he receive in a few minutes news from the West. These illustrations make it evident that while man is physically weak, yet intellectually and spiritually he is powerful. From a physical stand point he cannot conquer a farther or a wolf but by his spiritual, ideal power he subdues all the animals, this holy power in man is one of the Divine be, towels - It is a sign of the power of God.

Consider what power has brought us together in this meeting - the East and the West. It is evident that this is not through the material power - It is the Ideal power which brings us together. It is the ideal power which establishes a bond between hearts - It's the Ideal power which makes us kinder to each other. It is the Ideal power that brings nations together. The ideal {{p19}} power that organizes the heterogeneous people into a homogeneous whole. It is the Ideal power that brings to us the in flee of the spirit. It is the ideal power that explores the mystical regions of science- It is the Ideal power that codifies laws and regulations. It is the Ideal power that sets man a ruler over the domain of nature - corporeally man is not important, but spiritually he is mighty. The physical side of his life is weak and easily defealed but the ideal side of his life is the all conquerer. The physical side of man is like an animal but the ideal aspect of his existence is humanistic - Physically man is aggressive, tyrannical, ignorant overbearing blood thirsty; - Ideally he is just, gentle, win, patient and benevolent. He is peaceful - he seeks unity. He bestows life. He is the cause of honor in the world of humanity. He is conclusive to progress of mankind. In short these two realities are in man. His physical reality is in need of assistance. It needs food - water, sleep and rest, and if it does not get these it will perish, likewise if the ideal reality {{p20}} of man does not receive its sustenance it also shall die. The Holy divine manifestations appeared so that the ideal reality of man may be fed - that his thoughts may take a higher flight his intellect may expand - spiritual morals be revealed and extraordinary progress be made. Therefore we cannot state that the ideal reality of man is not in need of sustenance, for, his physical reality receives the material for. The food of the Ideal reality of man is Divine Bestowals - the breath of the holyspirit and Heavenly confirmation.

I hope that you may become the recipients of the heavenly food so that the ideal reality may be strengthened - your spiritual powers increased - regeneration may be obtained and thus you may become radiant-and the luminous angels of Heaven.

Dear Harriet!

Willing service to our fellow men is the highest expression of virtue. Everyone is able to render some kind of service. The heart and mind must become re-utilized with the dynamic power of service. Service in any given form - so far as it is unselfish - is identical with religious devotion. All those who longs to serve God, let them serve man - who is in God's image and likeness, for the image and likeness of God causist of divine virtues. One of those divine virtues is service. This makes it clear, that when {{p2}} we are clothed with the garment of service, we have adorned our being with one of the attributes of Divinity. I may go a step further and, say, that in this radiant century, Divinity, with all Its intrinsic, basic qualities has become vocal in the "Servant". When we reflect over this, just for one moment we will realize how majestic, how lofty, how wonderful the station of Servitude is! This is the age in which not only God is serving humanity with all the beautiful sympathy and tenderness but He has become an example for all those whose watchword is Service. In this instance, one of the most spiritual men of the East has said more {{p3}} than one thousand yrs. ago: "Servitude is an essence, the quintessence (or the core) of which Divinity." This is therefore, strictly speaking in an age of Service, - service to all creation animate or inanimate beings to organic or inorganic life.

This morning we had tea in the Persian Samawar in the reception room. Mirza Mohamaud chanted Baha-ollah's communion. There was a woman from America who came early and told the Master about her visions and dreams. This is the age of Reality, he said, if you live in accord with the teachings of Baha-ollah, you will attain to the Knowledge of all things. 

The President of Theosophical {{p4}} Society called on the Master and after an interview February 13th was fixed as the date on which the Beloved to address them.

The relatives of Mon. Nicholas, Secretary of the French Legation in Teheran, who has written a book on the life of the Baha and has translated his writings had an interior with our Beloved. One of them spoke a little Persian but not enough to understand. The Master said: - We are striving to improve the moral life of Persia. For Morality is the foundation of all human progress. Whenever you observe that a nation is morally in the process of regeneration, rest {{p5}} is assured that that nation is progressing.

Several important French people called and each had a short interview.

A woman who insisted that the animals had the same intelligence as man had a long interview. She would not like to believe otherwise. The Master said: Animals are unable to discover the secret problems for all that you enjoy today is the result of human mind and not the outcome of the thoughts of animals. The animal is deprived of the {{p6}} spiritual susceptibilities and is out of touch with the idealism of the Kingdom. A child is born, it does not Know anything about mother's breast; jet as soon as its tiny mouth gets hold of her breast; it seeks.

More people men and women, had interviews, each one coming out radiant and happy. It was nearly twelve. The rooms were crowded, many Americans, some English, a few French. The Master came in. All arose from their seats. He commenced his address by welcoming them and said he has {{p7}} been speaking for the last two hours without interruption. In the world of Genesis every power or energy has a focal center. For example the center of intelligence is the brain. The center of vision is the eye. The center of hearing is the ear. The center of speech is the tongue. For the power of gravitation, there is a center which is between the heaven and earth and the composite elements of this globe gravitate around that center. Where is the center of light? It is the Sun. Although there are many luminous objects; for instance the fire is luminous; the lamps is {{p8}} radiant; the insects such as fire-flies are light giving; even same of the plants are phosphorescent, yet the center of light is the Sun. The moon is a light bestowing body, the planets in the solar system are radiant bodies. Let that all receive their lights from the Sun....However, the center of Divine Virtues are the Manifestations of God. Just as the Sun is the center of lights, likewise each one of the prophets of God is the focal point of ideal perfectious, the dawning-place of the creatural virtues and the {{p9}} break of heavenly attributes. If this sun traces the earthly bodies; that sun educates the spiritual verities. If this sun is the center of material lights; that Sun is the center of ideal lights. This is a phenomenal Sun; that is, the Sun of Reality. Therefore we must ever turn our faces to that spiritual Sun; so that we may acquire ideal perfections; the word of humanity be illumined; we may free ourselves from the vices of the world of nature, and be imbued {{p10}} with the excellences of humankind. Then the earthy soul will became heavenly; Material susceptibilities will became divine; eternal life will be obtained; celestial happiness realized in the reality of man; day unto day man will advance; the minds will develop; the souls will be refined; the world of morality will became illumined; humanity will discover the reality of phenomena, and unfathomed the mysteries of God. Then he will become the Perfect Man and evolve into the Image and likeness of God.

Thus he ended his wonderful address, building before any eyes the vision of the Perfect Man. The shake hands with everyone and with Man. Drying went out to take his customary walk. It was a rainy day. On his return we had lunch. The Master rested for a while and when he arose Haji Ameen came in with two very prominent Persians who were leaders in the recent revolution. Naturally enough the discussion was turned upon events in Persia the short-sightedness of the leaders in making many mistakes and playing to the hands {{p12}} of Foreign Powers. The Master said. It is natural in man to oppress. When two individuals figth, they go before the civil Court and settle their differences but there is no love or court whereby the noxious may resort thereto and arbitrate their conflicting interests; therefore when they arise to support each other's rigths, there is no one to say "No". It is a natural tendency that every created being desires to gain superiority over others. Every plant desires to draw unto itself all the growing virtue of the land. Every animal aims to gain superiority over others. This is the requirement of {{p13}} of the world of nature. Intelligence is of two kinds. Divine Intelligence and natural Intelligence. Divine Intelligence prompts man to justice, leads him to equity, teaches him pity and long suffering; may rather, it teaches him to prefer others to himself. But his natural intelligence prompts him to injustice, iniquity and the practice of the survival of the fittest. Many other points were discussed. In one passage he said: "All the doors were closed except this Door of the Kingdom of Abha." Again: We are striving that the moral stamina of Persia be reinforced; her commerce increased, her system of {{p14}} education perfected, and her scientific attainment improved. It is easy to destroy, but it is difficult to build. God loves those souls who are the means of the up building of a country. Man must become the well-wisher of the whole world. Again: Morals are of two kinds. Civic morals as enjoyed by the Western people and divine morals which are made possible through divine Teachings and the love of God. If an average westerner does not steal, or does not commit minder, he is afraid of civic punishment and the loves. Were it not the fear of these loves he might have {{p15}} done worse. But a person who is imbued with divine Morals, he will not act against any human being because he loves God. Again: "If the Bahais live and act for one you is accord with the teachings of Baha-ollah you will see the results!"

Princess Guika with a friend of hers came and see Our Beloved. He advised the Princess to be always happy, to laugh troubles to scarn, never give any importance to difficulties. The son of Sheik-orraiss, a well Know Bahai arrived. This young man is studying in one of the Paris sebaalo.

{{p16}}

By this time the Master tired and wearied came into the drawing room and sitting on the chair he said: I love to be alone. I love to be in a meadow and be down under the tree, beneath is the green branches.

But God has destined otherwise. He commands me to speak. We have not came here to be silent otherwise I love silence. When in Adrianople I used to go out in the country and stay there all day.

In the evening many Persians called. He spoke to all of them with the greatest of Kindness and gentleness. Haji Ameen, Mirza Aja and many others were invited to dend with him. Day by day we grow to have him more and more and be ever ready to sacrifice our lives in His Path.

Love to all Ahmad.

Dear Harriet!

This Cause had appeared in America; today, there would not have been a single soul in that country who would not be either a Bahai on a friend. Our Beloved stated that (In the cause of his talk with Maage-ol Mamalek and a number of Persians in his apartment this afternoon). I hope a wonderful statement as this will inspire the hearts of the friends to exert themselves to the utmost in spreading the Teachings of Abha, in inviting the people to sit around this heavenly Table and in cementing the hearts together for the Love of humanity. A statement such as this will not only show us what the Master {{p2}} thinks of the America people, but it gives us a faint glimpse of what he expects of them to do in the immediate future- so that if he ever returns to that country he may see with his own blessed Eyes the fruits of his long years of labor, imprisonment, sufferings and hardships. It is an unmistakable fact that this Cause will be spread all over the world, nations and people will embrace it, but if the Bahais of today arise with the greatest effort, they will hasten coming of that day and they will be the divine pioneer of this Mighty Movement of Peace and brotherhood. May each one of us put his shoulder to the wheel and work with hope and courage!

{{p3}}

As I expected, the interest is growing and more have arrived today. They crowd the hall and the reception room, and many are waiting to meet Our Beloved. Here as elsewhere everybody gets a chance to drink the water of life from the hand of the cup bearer of eternity. There are some people who have come from Switzerland and other points to visit the Master. He dispenses his Merry and benevolence to all, irrespective of color or race creed. This morning we drank tea in his divine presence and be related to the small number of Persians, the dramatic story of investigating the sent and Acca by the Sultan {{p4}} just before the declaration of freedom to banish him to Africa were submerged in a tempestuous sea of trials and difficulties, but outwardly everything seemed calm and undisturbed. Even some of the friends did not know what was going on. The people in Acca, because, we did not show any sign of agitation, thought we are safe. They were wondering. They were wanted to say: "We heard so many rumors about the impending danger to these Bahais, yet do we see them carrying themselves with such dignity {{p5}} and serenity. They are happier than all of us." During those days Abdul Baha was most happy and planted an orchard with many Kinds an fruitful trees. People passing by would exclaim with wander: "Look at these mad souls! They are beneath the threat of sword and exile to the remotest part of Afria or they may drawing in the middle of the sea - yet do we them planning a garden and planting trees. But these very skeptical people lived to eat of the fruits of these trees.

{{p6}}

Two ladies who were the friends of Miss Sauh of Farmer of Green Acre were presented to the Master. He inquired about her and said: "Whosoever is Kind to Miss Farmer is Kind him and whosoever loves Miss Farmer loves him.

To another Person he said: Abdul Baha prays at the Threshold of the Almighty that our soul may become wholly spiritual, that through him people may become more detached, that they may themselves in repport with heavenly Power; that the beauty and favor of Baha-ollah may encircle all of them. May they become a new creation! May they obtain {{p7}} a new spirit and may they attain to the highest pinnacle of illumination and spirituality! To three others he said: Just as you are striving in material sphere work also in spiritual sphere. Try to suffer the people to enter in the Kingdom of God. To tell them only about the history of the Cause brings no permanent result, make their Bahais. There is a vast difference whether you hear about the light; see the light or whether you live in the light. Persuable the people to live in the realm of light and not only be satisfied to hear about it.

{{p8}}

When the people live in the realm of light, then their hearts will be illumined: then their spirits will be rejoiced with the divine Glad-Tidings, then these minds will become the receptacles of the Holy-Spirit; then they shall be regenerated; then they shall enter in the Kingdom of Abha.

Mr. and Mrs. Horace Holley with their child arrived from Switzerland. Mr. Holley met Our Beloved last year in Switzerland and wrote a small pamphlet with his experience in his presence. Mr. Holley {{p9}} is now writing a volume on the economic aspects of the Bahai Movement. The work will be published before long. The Master loved his little girl. He took her in his arms and caressed her: My dear baby, good baby, dear baby. How are you? Candies were brought in and the child was of course very happy. An American Bahai woman has just arrived from the U.S. It was like meeting a friend from "old home," although to the Bahais the whole world is "home".

About noon the Master came out and gave a {{p10}} talk on the subject of how the Manifestations of God are different from the risk of the people. This talk will be very useful in America, because there are many people who believe that they are either Christ or someday they will evolve into Christ state. Another question the Master touched upon was: Why there were not many material loves in {{p11}} the New Testaments.

After the meeting the Beloved went with Maayar-ul-Momaleh to take his walk. About 2 o'clock they returned, our Persian guest, complaining that the Master made him tired with walk. After his rest tea was served and he told us the history of same of the Kings of the present Persian dynasty and how their week administrations affected the life of the Persian people. About 5 o'clock {{p12}} he called Mirza Valliolah Khau, Mirza Aga Gaemmagan and myself to go out with him. For one hour we walked. He did not speak except at the end. We were glad to give him a chance to rest. Returning  he sent a cable to Egypt about Mirza Abdul-Fazl, saying that "He is me". Then he remarked: Mirza Abul Faze and Haji Mirza Heydar Ali are peerless and unique. They are perfect Bahais. They embody in themselves Bahai principles: their value is not now appreciated. It will become known later on.

Afterward Mou. and Madame Dreyfus came in. The Master recited several humanism stories as told to him by Nouri Bay about his London and Paris experiences many years ago. We had suffered about eleven o'clock and the interesting chapter of another day came to an end.

Love to all. Ahmad

Dear Harriet!

Europe today is bathed in the sunlight of divine Love. From Our Beloved love radiates to all directions. Here and there, I observe that many souls are warming themselves under this soft beaming, world-illuminating Sun of Love. All the regions are flooded with its Glorious lights. I may not comprehend fully the deep significance of the inter-play of these hidden and manifest forces which are set loose by the Invisible Hand; but of one thing I feel quit assured and it is this: The Power of divine Love is guiding the destiny of those characters who are inspired to play their parts upon the stage {{p2}} of humanity in order to usher in the golden era of universal Peace and the oneness of the world of humanity. In this radiant century, the inhabitants of the world will be blessed with the complete realization of Baha-u-llah and Abdul Baha luminous lights; war and its attendants evils will be banished from the face of the earth; carnal desires will be replaced by spiritual susceptibilities; brutal forces will be changed into beautiful activities; from East to West the sweet melody of Peace shall be hearkened, and from north to south the celestial Music of Love shall rejoice and inspire the hearts. Let us hail the early twilight of that Divine Day.

{{p3}}

It is a wonderful blessing to be always in the Presence of One whom we call the "Master" but this privilege has its responsibilities. Just to think that I am with him by day and by night; in the morning I drink tea in his holy Presence; at noon I sit at his heavenly Table; in the evening I partake of his bounties! None of us deserve so much but I pray to God that He may give us capacity to appreciate these generous heavens.

{{p4}}

Today several people had interviews. Mr. and Mrs. Scott in whose studio we had a meeting this afternoon received his benedictions. He told them: May you become more illumined day by day. May you be the means of making Paris radiant for this city is very dark. They are submerged in the Sea of materialism. They are living upon the earth; may you give them wings whereby to soar. Be ye hopeful! God will confer upon you a great pourer; so that you may become enabled to deliver them from this danger. Then they shall hear the {{p5}} song of the Kingdom. Continue to keep your meetings. Be kind to all the newcomers. The snore you show them Kindness the better will be it is. Be ye kind to everyone. Where you meet them, tell them how happy you are to see them, show the happiness in your face in your words and in your action. Then they will be attracted to the Cause.

Many more people drunk from the Fountain of life; some are asked about Esperanto others legged him to speak on astrology and the Science of numbers. When he came out, his subject was astronomy and he delivered a {{p6}} a wonderful exposition which will be of much interest to astronomers.

He took some of the Persians with himself and went out for a walk. On his return we had lunch and after his rest the Persian Ambassador to France came to pay him his respect. Questions which belong purely to Persia, its past and its {{p7}} present were discussed; the Master illustrating his points with certain historical events which demonstrated the fact that Persia and other Oriental countries were once very progressive and prosperous.

Persia the arrival of the Persian Ambassador we were having tea in his holy Presence. He spoke about Massafa Bagdad; He was very courageous; he said, " and a wonderful Bahais. When he tried in Bagdad all the police were charged by the government to get hold of him; But he would go into the sheets, walk all around and yet the {{p8}} police did not dare to touch him. When the Ambassador left, Our Beloved with Mon. Dreyfus left for Mr. and Mrs. Scott is home, Mirza Mohmaud, Sayad Assa dollah and myself took the subway and reached there in time. The Master was walking with Mon. Dreyfus in front of the house. He told us to go up and he will join us in a few minutes. Once in the studies we found quite a large audience; those who spoke English were gathered on one side with Madame Dreyfus in the center - so that she may translate for them. 

{{p9}}

The French were all clustered in another part. When the Master came in, all arose. Mon. Dreyfus translated aloud in French Madame Dreyfus translated in English so low that only those who were around near could hear her. First the Master spoke about his pleasure at seeing them; then he went deeply into the discussion of the four standards of Knowledge; ending his talk with a recital of the martyrdom of the King of the Martyrs and the Beloved of the Martyrs in Esphalan. He was so affected by the recital of this tragic story that his voice shook and trembled.

{{p10}}

The room was filled with a strange spirit of calmness and spirituality. Only those who have experienced such divine moments can understand what I mean; for that rare ineffable. Somewhat can never be expressed in so many words. The opening of his address will be of interest to you. He said that he was anticipating meeting them very much. Praise be to God. He see them all gathered in this gathering. Last year he met also the believers in the same shadow. Therefore he was very happy to see them again gathered with joy. Just as he has joy and fragrance may they {{p11}} also be endowed with the same qualities! Last year he returned from Paris to Egypt; Then observed that his journey was not perfected. And as he had promised the American friends, he said to himself, he must fulfill his promise. Although our body could not withstand the trip, get his spirit was attracted toward the believers of God. Therefore he sailed for America. After 15days on the ocean he disernbarked in 20 years. From coast to coast he travelled; he stayed in many large cities; through some of the cities he passed two or three times till he reached Los Angeles, Calif. In all the Kingdom of God, in all the {{p12}} meetings he elucidated the Teachings of Baha-ollah; in many of the churches he delivered addresses; in many of the Conferences of Peace he talked; in some of the universities he spoke in several synagogues he delivered sermons even before the gatherings of Free-thinkers and Socialists and through the confirmation and providence of Baha-ollah no one was able to oppose the Cause.

Dear Harriet

So far as the present indications are concerned I feel that next month at this time the Master may be either on the eve of his departure for the Hoglaw or he may be  on his way toward Egypt. I know not in the slightest what God hath in store for me. I wonder whether my star shines in the Eastern or Western sky. When I search through the very inmost chamber of my heart, what do I see? I see something which cannot be deciphered. However whether in the East or in the West my only object is to serve {{p2}} Our Beloved. In the past I have been enabled to serve so very little that I hope in the future I may become confirmed to render might services to the Cause. If we go to the East and if I am with Our Beloved while there, I will be always glad to serve my dear brothers and sisters across the seas. But if I return to America, then I will again associate with the friends so that unitedly and with one accord we may cultivate friendship and love amongst all the people. This is the day that all our words must be transmitted into actions and all our endeavors expended in the direction of Peace.

Today I had tea from the Blessed hands of the Master, after which I read to him an article written by Mr Jos. H. Hannen in "the Life". He was most pleased with it. Then I read to him a letter from Mrs M. Haney. He said : Mr and Mrs Haney, and Mr and Mrs Jos Hannen are indeed very  blessed souls. They are real servants and maid-servants of the Cause. A quotation from the Special Center of the Covenant Issue od the Star of the West on the meanings of "He is God" brought forth a very brilliant exposition pf Divinity and the Manifestations of God.{{p4}} Man cannot comprehend the essence of God. He is the limited and God's essence is the unlimited. All the attributed referrable to God, such as omnipotent, omniscient Merciful are only qualifying attributes. They are only attributes negating imperfections in the essence of God. Otherwise God being the Unnamable, we cannot refer to Him with any special names. Even the Word "God" is after all a word which brings to our consciousness the realization of that Unfathomable Absolute Something. Therefore all these names and attributes {{p5}} belong to the Manifestations of God. In order to understand an object, we must become greater that that object and then give to it a name and define it with clear definition, now when we come to God and its essence we can never know anything about it, we came in touch with that divine ineffable "Something" only when we stand before the Manifestation. The difference between the Bahais and certain past religious and sects is this:- They believe that there is God and there are creatures. Some believe that the essence of God has to become vocal {{p6}} in a human personality; others believe that the essence of God is divided into myriads of particles or sports and in turn these do manifest themselves constantly in the human bodies. But the Bahais believe there is the essence of God, the knowledge of which is unattainable by man; It is te Mystery of Mysteries and the Essence of essences and the Light of lights. There is the Manifestation of God, the transparent Mirror, the Clear channel the Perfect Man who represents to us all the ideas of "God" that we can clearly grasp; who reveals {{p7}} to us faint glimpses of that far off Light and who opens our eyes to the majestic Glory of the Eternal Kingdom. These are creatures who receive the teachings and who try to live the life of purity and sanctity He spoke a long time on this most wonderful subject and as I think now I can remember some more points but I tried to give you an idea of the subject rather than the talk. Several people received short interviews after which he came out to deliver his address. He started  by saying:- "There are certain trees which grow and develop very quickly; {{p8}} other trees may take a long time before they put forth leaves and blossoms. It is evident that Paris is one of those trees which may take a long time to grow. It is his hope that it may give much fruits, Paris  in reality is a very artistic city. It has many interesting sights for the tourists. Many charming spots to intrigue the eyes. We might slate that material civilization has pitched its tent in Paris; but the  tent is so big that here and viere there are great hatches of obsecurities under it. It is his hope that very luminous lamp may be enkindled under this tent {{p9}} so that the darkness may be dispelled. These lamps are Bahais. It is his hope that if they may cast their rays all around; that they may bestow lights that they may become able to free these souls from the darkness of the world of nature. "He gave them a heavenly exposition of natural and divine Civilizations."

Finishing his talk he called Haji Asmeen and Mohammad Khan and went out to take a walk toward the end of his spiritual address {{p10}} his eyes were closed and his voice was soft. It was as though we were listening to the music of spheres, full of paltus and sweetness. It was as though he was attuned with the Celestial symphony of the Kingdom and through his voice those whose hearts wear clear could hear the glorious songs of the angels. His voice become softer and sweeter, like the murmuring of the gentle breeze through the branches like the flowing of the pure water amidst the eternal rocks and then he was silent and the silence {{p11}} fell upon the audience. After awhile they all looked upon each other as though they were soaring in another world. Then suddenly out of the deep silence, the voice of the Master was heard. The rich quality, the purity and the etheric beauty of his voice is not of this world. The strength of his voice grew and grew, it filled the room and it was as though he spoke to all the denizens of the earth. Authority sat upon his ample blow. He spoke with deep feeling and divine earnestness interpreting to us the benefits of divine civilization.

{{p12}}

Suddenly he arose from his seat as though prompted by a heavenly command and striding from one end of room to another he  said: "Now praise be to God that his holiness Baha-ollah hath appeared. He has upraised  the flag of divine civilization he has opened the doors of the Kingdom of God; the Sun of Sun of Reality has Shone forth; the lights of the divine  Favors have encircled us; unfolded every truth. Therefore  let us strive, so that we may spread divine civilization; so that {{p13}} we may unfurl the  Ensign of knowledge; so that we may illumine the minds, so that we may enlighten the intellects. Awake! Awake! for the doors of the Kingdom of  Abha are open!  for the Bestowals of God are infinite. If on such a day we fail, the end will be refresh. If before this salubrious spring, we may remain thirsty, life will be without result. If we are still unaware of the Favors of this Most Great Day we {{p14}} we will always be portion less and without a share. Here he looked at the audience his voice become authoritative, his eyes were shining with the light of heaven and his cry thrilled all. He fairly cried:  We must raise the call of the Kingdom of Abha.  We must establish the  basis of divine Civilization.  We must transform this world into another world. We must illumine this dark globe. We must make these blind eyes see. We must suffer these deaf ears hear. {{p15}} We must make these ones hear. Then out of this dark sail which is the world of nature navigated flowers and fragrant tulips will grow. Arise! Arise! For the Bounty of God is with us. Be hopeful! Be hopeful! For the rays of the Sun of Reality are towering over  over us! Rejoice! Rejoice!  For the Clouds of Mercy are raining upon us! Awake! Awake! for the gates of the Treasures of the Kingdom are opened before our faces! Short coming is not allowed at this time. Silence is most permissible at this hour! 

{{p16}}

Now lukewarmness is not commendable! Now immobility us reprehensible on his return from the walk he praised the beauty of Paris and  lunch was served. Around his table all the Persians sat eating the maternal food which he had prepared for them. After an hour's rest two  Turkish ladies, a gentleman and a Baroness came to see him.

The French wife of an old Turkish  General called Omar Paslie came with her. The {{p17}} The Master knew this general who is dead now. Immediately a bond of sympathy was found and the many sweet reminiscences of the General were recited by Our Beloved as though they had happened yesterday. Then Gaemmagam and Haji Aga Khaleel came to see the Master Tea was served and Our Beloved spoke to them.

When they left. the Master came into the other room and complained of fatigue because hehas been speaking all day. Notwithstanding, he talked with us a great deal and {{p18}}
portrayed to us his conversation with Nouri Bey about the existence of God.

He called on Miss Sanders while there he said: "Paris is like unto a green Meadow, the  people are like unto the sheep, they are praying in this meadow, they drink of the flowing streams. The materialists cow-like froze also with the rest. They never raise their heads to see whether these is any heaven or any stars. They are submerged in the sea of materialism.

Again he said: Save souls are like unto dry woods, others are like wet woods and {{p19}} there are others like unto the stone. He came out and I was following. He walked through the avenues bought some fruits from a store and met accidentally Mrs  Fraser who gave him a newspaper article about the Cause. Hardly staying half an hour than he look Mirza Mahmoud with himself and went to pay a visit to the Persian Ambassador. Returning from the Embassy Man and Madamed Derffins came and he talked with them {{p20}} 'till ten o'clock. Then dinner was served.

I think the Master will go to Stratford on the 15th of  February and stay a few days, then return to Paris to prepare for our Eastern Journey.

Dear Harriet!

In speaking to an Oriental Bahai Abdul Baha said that it is now only a few days that we are in Paris. It is the beginning of the promotion of the Cause of God. Paris is very dark; but we are hopeful that through the Bestowals of the Most Great Luminary that in the center of this pitched darkness, the Divine Lamp may be ignited. His Power alone transforms the dark earth into luminous substance suffering the hard rock to yield and flowers and hyacinths. He was now sowing the seeds and it may take sometimes before they germinate in the soil.

{{p2}}

This morning when I went into the presence of the Master and was offered a cup of tea he said to me: Paris is very cold. Can you do something to make it warmer. I knew of course that he meant spiritual heat; because the apparent indifference of the Parisians to spiritual matters was well-known them he said: He was happy in London, although he was not feeling well. Here my health is very good but I am very unhappy, because I observe that people are thinking of everything else excepts Gods Paris is like unto a beehive; the people are the bees. They are busy, honey-making but their honey {{p3}} consists of the pursuit of pleasure and gratification of desires.

Afterwards he dictated some Tablets for the Permain believers, giving them the good news of his approaching visit to Stuttgart and also permitting them to come to Paris. About 10 o'clock people began to come. I saw a woman who was as though in deep sorrows. Her eyes were wandering neither and thither aimlessly. Silently she sat in a corner of the room avoiding any communication. The Master entering the reception room saw her, and beckoned her to himself. As soon as he told her welcome," she began to weep. "Don't cry" Abdul Baha {{p4}} said in English. Then through me: Be free from every tie. Do not attach thy heart to anything. Open thy wings and soar toward the infinite space of God. A bird whose wings are tied cannot fly. Now let thy wings be unloosed from these rusty feathers. Released thyself from every attachment to this ephemeral world. All these things are phantasmal appearances, passing soldier - like before our eyes. They are all unreal. Strengthen thy wings so that thou mayst soar above these ever changing conditions and reach to the world of Absolute Reality. These {{p5}} thou shall obtain a happiness which belongs to the Kingdom of Abha: a happiness which is eternal just as the Kingdom of God is eternal. Be radiant! Be joyful! Be serene! Be free! Be free! Be free from sorrows! A person whose heart is attached to this world cannot progress. The Love of God makes man free. It is like unto the sword. It cuts all the chains. The Love of God is the remedy for every disease; the salve for every wound and freedom from every prison. I hope that thou wilt attain to those ideal worlds. Read the Tablets of Baha-u-llah. Study the Hidden Worlds.

{{p6}}

Then thou wilt become spiritual, illumined, godlike, divine. The glorious Sun of the Love of God shall arise from the horizon of Thy heart; thy eyes shall perceive the Light; thy ears shall hear the Light small voice and at last thou shalt behold the Glory of the Lord. May I give you the substance of another interview? Is not this first one wonderful? Is it not a constructive prescription for every one of us? How he ministers unto all creation? Here a man enters: you are very welcome the divine voice is being heard. He hopes the man is happy. He tells him that as he looks into his face ,{{p7}} he feels a Keen sense of joy, for in his forehead he observes the signs of faith and assurance and in his eyes he sees the traces of intelligence and understanding it. An English girl who is a good Bahai and an earnest soul enters the room, and found her friend in the Presence of the Master. She sat on a chair at the Beloved's bidding. Then facing both of them he said: They were like unto the tender plants. He has planted them with his own hands and he was watering them. It is his hope that they will grow. Day unto day may they become more verdant and graceful. May {{p8}} they put forth leaves and blossoms and with the utmost freshness and beauty may they give shades to those who are weary and travel-stained, - so that under their outstretched branches, people find rst, find peace, compose and the serenity of the spirit! May the travellers be released from this trouble burned world through their sympathy. This was his hope for them. It was his greatest yearning to see them adorned with many branches, so that they may cash much shade! Unless the tree puts forth, shady branches producing leaves, blossoms and fruits no one will be attach to it. Therefore his advice {{p9}} to them was to strive day and night so that the trees of their lives may be converted and yield fruits at all time.

Thus the hours rolled on in this divine atmosphere! Thus one heard the finest music of the heavenly World played on and on to ravish the hearts of man and to draw him high unto the Throne of God, there to joined his voice with the celestial Choir! Then the Divine Musician with his lyre came out. He played another strain full of symphony and charm. Now he played a tragic note, and now his voice swelled into rich diapason, sweeping the feelings and emotions of the audiance upward and downward.

{{p10}}

Hearken! and from the visible voice and the invisible lyre so high a note arise, vibrating through the pure air, pouring out the fullness of life in rich modulating tones. He has come to Paris striking the first note but he finds Paris is very cold. He was anticipating that in this trip he shall behold in this city the luminous torch of the Love of God. Now having arrived he finds that the inhabitants are steeped deeper in the darkness of materialism. Every mention is on their lips excepts the mentions of God. They entertain every thought except the thought of the Kingdom of God. Every call is being heard in Paris except the call of {{p11}} of the world of Light. As I pondered over this condition of the Parisians, he found that like unto the worms they are crawling in the dark strata of the earth. Day unto day they were going deeper and deeper, never desiring to extricate themselves from the gloom of these narrow labyrinths of the earth. Therefore it was his hope that the friends who were living in Paris may show an effort, and make a move that perchance its inhabitants may obtain a new tongue may receive a new exhilaration; may take a goodly portion and a shore from the heaven by illumination.

After shaking hands with everybody <12> he went out with Maus Dryfus, returning home he had his lunch. At half past three Mau Dryfus came back. In the cause of conversation he asked the Master whether he would like to go up the Eiffel tower to see Paris. He said he could see Paris without ascending the tower of Eiffel. "From that height you may breathe over Paris a new life" Mau Dreyfus said. He was doing that every day from here, "the Beloved replied.

He told us the story of the life of Budha. Afterwards he called on Rasheed Pasha who was once the Governor General of Syria and created much {{p13}} trouble at that tie for the Master. As governor General of Syria under the regime of Abdul Hamed he was an absolute desk at the Syrian dreaded his power. With just a cable to the Sultan that such and such a person was the enemy of the State he could destroy anyone as a moment notice. Our Beloved told us in details his dealings with this man.

{{p14}}

In the afternoon Madame D'astre came and the Master spoke with her on the apathy and indifference of the Parisians to spiritual truths. He told her that person was a light sleeper, one single touch would awake him if he slept heavily, then one must awake him by shaking him.

{{p15}} 

Another person may sleep so soundly that he may need a big stick to arouse him. But if the stick does not bring the desire effect, we may have to bring into service the noise of a cannon and if ever this will not awake the sleeper we will then have to use dynamite. In short, the sleepy ones must become mindful. He gives her the glad tiding that this indifference on the part of Parisians will be changed into a deep and lasting interest and in the very center of Paris the Standard of Baha-ollah shall be upraised.

We were glad to hear the good news from various cities that the American friends {{p16}} are arising with great earnestness to work for the Cause and to spread the message of the Kingdom. These news delight the heart of Our Beloved. May each one of the believers become a lighted candle! The Master is waiting all the time to receive the news of the glorious services accomplished by the friends! The more they serve the Cause of Peace and they put forth exertion and wholehearted endeavor - the greater will be their spiritual reward. I am also praying that God may assist me to perform one little service in His divine Vineyard.

Dear Harriet!

Today one of the believers brought a big bunch of "Pussy willows" which was the sign of spring. It was taken to the Master. Before anyone said a word he exclaimed: Oh! Oh! This is the first flower of spring. He loved it very much. In Persia it was very fragrant. He hoped that the feuds will all become as fragrant as the Rose of the Love of Iad. The lady that brought the first sign of the spring." Said something about her house. Abdul Baha told her, God willing she shall make her house the Marshall Azkar that is, she shall gather the souls in her abode raise the naive of God {{p2}} and spread the message of the Kingdom. Perchance thou she become the mean the promulgation the Kingdom of God in her city; perchance she and became the divine gardener and farm those lands with such skill as to gather many harvests throughout all ages and cycles. If a person arises to promote the Kingdom of God, day unto day, he will become more confirmed. If he was a lamp he will become a torch. Whereas formerly he was a river, he will now became a sea. Whereas formerly he was a plant, he will now become a mighty tree. 

{{p3}}

Apropos of Lowe news just received from American he said: Praise be to God that we have established the reality of the Cause of Mohammed in America. We destroy so many false new entertained idea that in regard to Mohammed. Now he people know the facts.

He called me to go out with him and visit now and Madame Dreyfus but when we reached the door of their apart they were coming out, so {{p4}} we walked back with them. The long live of interviews started; one after another the souls received the heavenly Bounties each person was encouraged with his words and advices. Everything he said cleared the atmosphere from the mists and clouds. Miss Fraser brought me these articles from the newspapers of Voking containing interesting accounts of the day the Master visited the Mohamadan mosque as well as reporting the main points of his address. 

{{p5}}

It was about twelve o'clock the Master finished the private Interviews. They were rather long and made him tired. Coming out he spoke on a most interesting topic, namely; the "soul the mind and the spirit," what we mean by these words, what relation exists between these three entities and what difference? Everyone was deeply absorbed in the subject. It {{p6}} was as though for a moment he brushed aside the veil and permitted us to peep with our limited vision through that world of God which is clearly seen by the divine gifted one. This brings to my mind a wonderful statement he made to person the other day: If the sea of his thought (Abdul Baha’s) because stormy dashing a thousand mountainous waves against the shore they cannot be compared with one ripple on the sea of his thought. This shows us how quite impossible it is too conceived of the grandeur of his world, of the majesty {{p7}} of his ideal, of the loftiness of his mind, of the sublimity of his soul and of the universality of his spirit. His is the power to Ken the secret of life and the mystery of being.

After the lecture he went out with now. Dreyfus and from the Lounge store he bought several umbrellas. The received Mirza Mehdi Khan of Rasht who is a great friend of Haji Ameen and just arrived from Egypt. He inquired about the health of Mirza Abul Fazl and receive a favorable report. This made him very {{p8}} happy. He told the new comer that had he brought a gift of a Kingdom could not make him any happier for he loved Mirza Abdul Fazl very much.

A Prof. from India came in and had extended interview. Afterward he spoke with the Persians and about seven he asked me to accompany and call again now. Dreyfus we were with them for quite a while and a pleasant hours was spent in divine conversation. Returning the charges daffaires of Persia was watching to see him. A few other friends were present.  Our Beloved talked to them about hid American trip. It was half fast ten when we had our dreams.

###Marseilles, France On my way to Nice Jan. 31st 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

You may be surprised to receive this from Marseilles but this morning Our Beloved told me to take a short time to Nice and carry a message to an important personage. Immediately I got out, found the hour of train, bought my ticket and now I'm on my way to Nice. It is now about eleven pm. I am in a compartment with an English man and his wife or rather a bride and bridegroom who are going to Nice for their honeymoon. Then there are two salesmen, two French, comedian going to fill an engagement in Marseilles and a captain of the army. To finish the passenger list, I found a young American from Washington DC who is working in moving-picture and here am I from Persia. For the first hour we sat and stared at each other. Turning to the young man, I asked him "Are you an American?" "Yes" the answers came. The conversation started then and little by little I told them the story of the Bahai Movement. Those who could not understand English was translated to them by others. They all listened with great attention. Having brought with me the Palo Altan and The Christian Commonwealth, I gave a copy to each.

{{p2}}

This morning when I presented myself before Our Beloved, I found Mirza Mehdi Khan was there. Turning his face to me he said: Mirza Mehdi Khan was his old friend; he was one of the firm Bahais; he had served the Cause very faithful. The Master inquired from him about the believers of one of the cities of Persia. He told him that they were all well and united, serving the Cause. Then the Master stated that origin of the promotion of the Cause was the spiritual condition of the friends. If the friends of God experience this spiritual condition, even if they are few they can set fire to a city. All morning people arrived, having interviews. The wife of Mr. De Sacy who died a few years ago and was a great teacher came to see the Master.

{{p3}}

Today Mirza Ali Akbar Rafsanjani and Aga Faraj, the baker arrived from Persia. The latter was the host of Ali Kuli Khan and his wife when they were in Teheran. When the Master came in these two were so overpowered  that before the eyes of all those who were present they fell at his feet, weeping. Everybody was affected by this manifestation of sincere emotion. The Master made them to get up and kissed their cheeks and welcomed them. There was much animation and spiritual exhilaration amongst the friends.

{{p4}}

The French element of the meetings is beginning to assert itself and as the days go on more and more Parisians came and depart. During the years that the Cause has been established in France, it has been kept more or less among the English and American contingents. It has not yet touched deeply the hearts of the French people. They all acknowledge that this is a great Cause but they are not willing to put aside their own ideas and work for it. I hope that through second visit of the Master, the Cause will really be spread amongst the French. If the Cause take hold of five French who may become real Bahais, then, there  will be a wonderful progress.

{{p5}}

The Master spoke today on the definition of the 
"spirit", going deeply into the subject and explaining some subtle points. Then he talked on the duties of the past religious and the duty of the Bahais. I would like to share with you the last part of his address in which he graphically and eloquently shows us the divine pathway: The duties and the responsibilities of the Bahais are these: They must be kind to all the religions. They must love humankind with all their hearts and souls. They must work for the public welfare. They must know that God is one; the Real Shepherd is One and all humanity constitute the sheep of one flock. Therefore they must be compassionate toward all. They must exert themselves to bring about the Oneness of the world of humanity. They must put forth the utmost effort to conciliate the hearts. They must be the means of the happiness and progress of the world. They must ever be ready to sacrifice their properties, their rest and their lives so that in the world of humanity divine illumination be diffused the Banner of Universal Peace he upraised, and the Tabernacle of the Oneness of the world of humanity be pitched in the very center of this globe.

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Here I am in Nice when the vases narcissus and all Kinds of flowers bloom in abundance all writers, when the winter is the balmy spring. People are waking in the streets with no overcoats and they hast under the sunshine with joy and pleasure. The city is full of bustle and hustle and they tell me tomorrow there will be the procession of cardinal if it does not rain. The famous Mont. Carlo is half an hour from here and if I find a few hours I may drop in and see what they are doing. Although they say they will not let in any curiosity seekers. The main avenue of the city is decorated with lofty arches and electric lights. It is a very long avenue. On both sides there are cafe's, restaurants and hotels and stores. This is a city of hotels. Hotel Majestic and Regina has wonderfully built on high hill which overlooks vast area of orange-grows delightful villas amidst gardens and rosegardens. I have sometimes exonerated when {{p2}}  I have said or written that in passing by certain streets the perfume of the flowers was inhaled but yesterday as I walking through one of these streets of real-dreamlands, the fragrances of lilies, roses and other flowers were so diffused that one would have liked to stay there all the time. Oh! the villas of Nice are so charming, so romantic, the architecture mostly spanish and French! These villas are surrounded with low walls over which there feature of different colored roses, thus adding to the charms of walking. On my arrival I inquired about the address of a friend on whom I wanted to call. Someone gave me an address and I talk a car. It was out of the city. The car for 1/2 an hour went along such lovely lanes on both sides of which there were these dreamy villas palm and arrange trees pushing their branches and fruits in sight. The conductors put off at a certain street. I began to walk for nearly two miles looking for the villa. At last I found it, but no such person lives there. Although I felt a little cross in losing two hours yet I thought I was really repaid in having such splendid views of one of the most idyllic cities of the world. On my return a pleasant incident occurred which merits recording here. As I walked back and took the car to come back to the city I observed three persons two ladies and one gentleman speaking in a strange language. The more I listened the less I knew to what human genus they belong.

{{p3}}

Then I caught the word "Khrasho". Now this word in Russian means "very good", My vocabulary in Russian however ends in that. So I made up my mind that they are Russian, remembering that someone told me there are many English and Russians in here. On this occasion I wore a felt hat and not Persian hat. Suddenly I caught a word which to my ears resembled "Baha-o-llah". My indifference changed into interest. The next word  was Isabella Grawinski, the name of the Russian authoress who has compassed the drama of the Bah and Baha-ollah. Then watching to the end of my patience I asked them in French whether they were talking on such a subject. They answered yes. I spoke to them about the Cause. They were never so surprised in their lives. They knew personally this Russian authoress. I got their address to send them French and English literature. I told them about our Beloved's trip in America and they seemed glad to hear about it.

{{p4}}

This morning we reached Marseilles. The train stopped there for half an hour. Leaving Marseilles behind we had Mediterranean on one side, and high, lofty mountains on the other one of the most sights as our train speed along we could see many orchards in full bloom, apple trees and other Kinds of fruitful trees were clad in the ferment of white and pink. The mountains, the country, the valleys were all verdant. To think that in the heart of the winter there is this wonderful spot - so like paradise. The sea was so blue and calm and the sun shining upon it made a beautiful picture of shimmering gold and turquoise. There were many villages built on the top of the mountains like birds building their nests on the top branches. These villages are many hundred yrs. old. On our way we passed through at least half a dozen large cities of France such is Dijan, Lyan Marseilles etc. Once looking out of the window I saw many men lying on the grass, enjoying the rays of the sun. The fragrances and the scene of nature all the way from Marseille, of valleys of green meadows of sweeping, vast field of farming of mounts and rivers, of villages' nestled crazily in the breast of garages, of cities etc. were unparalleled in beauty and charm. Such a contrast to the gloomy, rainy weather of London and Paris. No wonder poets and writers have sung the glories of the Sunny South and Riverie.

{{p5}} 

The train reached Nice at half-past two and not Knowing where I should go in this strange city I was first conducted to a hotel desiring to charge such inhabitant prices that I cleared the premises very quickly and have taken room in this hotel which is very clean and is in the  American street.

This evening the time hanging on my head I sailed out on the Main ave. Such concourse of people. It looks like a crowded street of Newyork. The cafes are brilliant with light and music. I sit on a chair and for 15 cents I have a cup of coffee and cream and cake and sit there for nearly an hour watchings the motley procession of curious humanity passing by, each one bent upon pleasure, vulgarity and gratification of desires and passions. Contrasting the thoughts prompting these men and women at this time and the ideals and precepts held aloft by our Beloved. I realized what a vast chasm exists between the two.

{{p6}}

One is of the realm of light; the other is from the abyss of darkness. One guides man to the origin of divine splendors, the other directs him to the prison of informal terrors. The first is Merciful attributes, the second is satanic suggestions. The former suffers man to attain to the height of nobleness, the letter degrade him to the lowest degree of humiliation. One teaches man the Mysterious of the Kingdom of God, the other leads him to the machination of satan. One is the Fire of Love of God; the other is the conflagration of the passion of self. One is spiritual, the other is canal. One is heavenly, the other is earthly. With such thoughts I slowly stepped back to my small room. The streets were still crowded, passion stalked abroad, the lights were shining; but I thought the city is dead and dark and cold. I shivered with pity and anguish. I like to return to My Beloved. I am disgusted with this kind of life that the people are leading. If the hart is not touched with the Breeze of God; if the mind is not illumined with the Light of God; if the spirit is not submerged in the transparent sea of God - what is the result of life? Yes the Master is hopeful of the future of human race. Let us hope and work with him. His Example let us all follow. His life let us all emulate. His glories and Graces let us all receive! Love to all.

My letters from Nice hot for general. For you and Louise, may be a few more whom you care to show.

Dear Harriet!

This morning having gotten up early to write you a letter I found it quite hard. Because neither you nor the friends are interested to hear from me but what your hearts long and yearn for, is to know what the master is doing or saying so in that way you may learn the lessons of life. Now I am far away from him. I cannot hear what he says, I cannot see what he does. So what is the use of writing letters, yet I argued write myself good and hard and came at last to the inevitable conclusion that you may be interested to hear about the nice; the result was that letter of which I was ashamed, nevertheless I mailed it to you. Having finished the letter I ate my breakfast and called a carriage to go and call on those people for whose visit I was sent for. It was altogether successful and I was invited to lunch. Realizing the importance of the situation on my return I sent a full report of what has transpired to Our Beloved. After words I was driven in the most fairy-like lanes {{p2}} of the suburb with Italian villas and gardens all abbooming are both sides. The beauty and charm of these scenes are indescribable. Returning from the lovely ride I joined the procession of humanity along the main avenue who were going to see the carnival. It was a procession of thousands walking on the sidewalks. When we arrived at the Place de Massena it had just started, huge chariots carrying hand of musicians and girls and bags dressed in all forms and manners. Crowds of men and women walking in front of these chariots, all masked and dancing to the air of music as the chariots proceeded through the streets. I had to get a mask because they were throwing at the people a kind of mud pills to the size of a big pea. It took more than two hours for the carnival to pass before the views of the spectators. In the Place de Massena there were four hands at four corners keeping the tens of thousands merrymakers who were coming from all parts of the city in a good mood. They danced in this big square or circle. All around the circle stands were built for the spectators but I preferred to circulate amongst the people. Decorations were rich and very beautiful. I am sending you a package of postal cards; one of the Carnival another of the scenes and views. It juries you just a faint idea of what is going on here and what is being done to attract thousands of tourists from all parts of Europe and America every year.

{{p3}}

I returned to my hotel very tired. Setting at the table heard people talking about the great mask ball which is going to be tonight in the big municipal Casino. I have had heard always about mask ball but never had seen one so after calling an person and returning to my hotel I found it is half-past nine. I am a few minutes I was ready to go. I went. But what a sight of colors and lights. Actually there were more than ten thousand people. I can never described it in few what I saw with my own eyes. There were so many kinds of dresses of various colors People representing different characters in history and drama. All over the big lighted hall people were either dancing or walking or sitting and taking refreshments. The ball was going to be over at 5 or 6 am but having seen what I wanted like a satisfied child but not happiness. I came have about 2 o'clock very tired and fatigued.

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

This letter must be short because I have not time to write in detail. The morning I called on a certain person, delivered the message of Our Beloved, and received a few, then coming out of the house I walked on the avenue on Le Promenade des Anglais which is very much similar to River Side drive in N.Y. with this difference that instead of the Hudson River we have the calm blue Mediterranean, right on the shore palatial Casinos are built and facing the Sea {{p2}} beautiful villas and hotels are constructed. It was specially a lovely day. The sky was blue, the sea was blue, the promenade from one end to another was decorated with flags and bantings and streamers and flowers. Stands were built. Multitudes of people are out gay and laughing. Everybody wears flowers. Little girls sell large bunches of violets, carnation roses etc. for five cents each. What is going to be today. They tell me. "The battle of flowers, "Le bataile des fleurs. Very lovely it is not? I wish all the battles were carried are with flowers instead of deadly weapon. So I walk to another watching thousands of well-dressed women {{p3}} happy children, gay men all. Enjoying the wonderful shining blue sea, drinking the fresh breeze, imbuing the warm rays of the sun. I had my thin overcoat. It got so warm that I had to take it off. The battle stats at two pm. I am invited for lunch to a heavenly Villa. Arriving there I am taken in the charming park. It is a dream, orange groves, palm trees, all green and verdant. Up and down through green bowers and quiet lovely lones we walk and talk. The villa that my host lives in is of Horentine architecture, very imposing, overlooking thus vast system {{p4}} of Path which the eyes never are fatigued to look at it. We return and have lunch. Then I leave and come to the Promenade des Anglais. All the roads leading to the Promenade are closed. I get in however and buy a seat. The floral floats splendidly decorated start to pass in review. The girls and boys on men and women in these floats throw bouquets of hyacinths anemones, violets, roses, carnations and other flowers to the spectators. They turn throw at them. Thy sell one hundred quite large bouquets for 3 francs a matter of 60 cents. Everybody has besides himself or herself a large basket. Same two or three baskets. There for the {{p5}} pace of three hours the carriages automobiles and floral chariots pass before the view, each one urging with the other in beauty of decoration and embellishment. This battle of flowers which is the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen in my life goes on; sometimes a regular shower of bouquets are exchanged between the spectators and the chariots. The promenade is literally covered with these bouquets no one stoops to gather them. It is not the etiquette to throw a bouquet which {{p6}} has dropped on the ground but if you catch it with in the air it is all right. I had a good place in front row and often I would look out and watch all along the line which is more than two miles a regular "war" was carried on with the utmost of earnestness and thousands of these "fragrant weapons" and "sweet missiles" were flying the air trying to find a victim. I have not time to give the description of some of the chariots which were a mas of flowers out of which peeped forth girls dressed in which with flower hornets but if I get a few photos I may show {{p7}} you. Suddenly we heard astrays whir and burr above our head and looking above it was an aeroplane flying over the promenade and instead of throwing bounds over the crowd, the aviator was throwing large bouquets of flowers. It was a beautiful sight to see these fragrant bouquets tumbling in the air and gracefully falling in the hands as over the head of the already enthusiastic and applauding people. There were large silk banner to be given to those whose chariots were most beautifully decorated.

{{p8}}

These passed in review at first. Toward the last the chariots winning the banners according to the judgment of the committee passed by carrying them along. It was about five that the "war" ended into a skirnieshe and the people setting the doors open, the crowd fought among themselves ruthlessly. I came to the hotel bewildered and pleased with this "battle".

I wrote a letter to our Beloved and went out to walk along the main avenue. Later on I went to a French theatre, was so tired and sleepy that I could hardly open my eyes when intermission arrived I left the theatre and came to my hotel to sleep.

Love to all

###Feb 4th 1913 5pm HOTEL DE PARIS MONTE-CARLO

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Monte-Carlo! It sounds strange? Well! here am I. I find the place most unique and very poetic. The scenery is very beautiful. The weather most equitable. I am looking out of the window of this luxurious hotel, in front I find the calm blue Mediterreanean with the quietness of evening. On my right is the famous Casino where thousands of people gain and lose. I did not go in. It is a most imposing building, built in the best French style. On my back is the high mountain, green and sublime. The whole town of Monte Carlo is full of hustling-bustling tourists from all parts of the world. {{p2}} This morning after writing you a short letter I took the electric car for Monte Carlo. It takes about one hour and half from Nice. The car ascends all the time. It passes through the loveliest country mountains and villas. Today the sun was shining, the weather was balmy and spring-like, perfumed with the fragrances of the flowers and Mimosa. All along the way the blue Mediterreanean was visible, glowing beneath the radiant rays of the sun. The blue sea was magically transformed into the blue heaven; for the glorious Sun darting down its scintillating rays upon the marmoreal surface of the sea, you could observe that the gentle motion {{p3}} of the water immediately changed those shining rays into sparkling stars. Again you could see the reproduction of the Milky Way stretched out as far as the horizon permitted. It was a beautiful ride, unique in many ways. Having arrived in Monte Carlo I made inquiry about the person I was sent here to see. The address was given to me without much difficulty I arrived at the place, was received with the utmost of courtesy and after two hours was out of the house, perfectly satisfied with the results. I just wrote a report of the matter to our Beloved {{p4}} so that he may know about it before my arrival in Paris. 

I bought a package of postal Card and mailed them to you, so that you may keep them with the rest. I also mailed two newspapers containing a full description of the bottle of flowers. Also a package of 18 postal cards containing the plates of some of the chariots and autos decorated with the flowers.

In a few minutes I return to the city. Tonight before all the public Sa Majeste (His Majesty) the Emperor Carnival will be burned. Tomorrow morning I will return to Paris.

Dear Harriet!

The train just started for Paris. I will be there for tomorrow at 6:30 pm. Looking back at my four days in Nice I find that praise be to God. I have accomplished my work the least I knew how and besides I enjoyed myself very much. It was work and recreation combined. I saw the funniest and the most beautiful, the ridiculous and the sublime during the carnival. I witnessed nature in mid-winter as I had never seen even in spring. I saw multitude of people in their gayest mood and happy disposition. Had I come {{p2}} at any other time I would not have seen so much. I came here with the purpose of staying only one day but it took me four days. I have been missing the talks of our beloved and his heavenly Presence and Inspiration. I am going back with the greatest pleasure, happy when I stand again before Him. Then I will have again something to write you. I think my letters of the last four or five days must have been an awful disappointment to you but never mind. I did not wanted to write anything but I thought I will keep up the daily record.

Tomorrow it will be exactly {{p3}} two months that we have left New York. It seems to me that so much has happened in the short time. 

I am now going back with a glowing description of Nice and its natural beauty. Perhaps I can convince Our Beloved to come a few days here to enjoy the incomparable scenes of nature.

I wished so much to send you and Louise bouquets of Nice flowers and I had it in my mind all day but when I returned from Monte Carlo I was so hurried that I forget it till I come in the train but it was too late. {{p4}} I blamed myself for this apparent neglect because during the last four days I have written so much of flowers and nature that I desired you to share them with me. However if I return with the Master I will not forget it. In the compartment there are four others beside me and I have talked already with them. It is rather late and they want to sleep; so I have them alone till tomorrow for they are going to Paris too. Give my heartfelt Bahai salutahan to Louise. I wish so much you two were here to enjoy Nice. 

Love to all

Dear Harriet!

This evening, after five days absence, I reached our apartment. Five days looked to me like five years. I would not have left Abdul Baha for the whole world were if not to fulfil his will but I am happy to be back. When I arrived the Master was in his own room talking with Gaem Magam, Moayen-ol-Mamalek and another nobility from Persia. Therefore, I did not disturbed him but I went to the room where the Persians were gathered. They were surprised to see me back. None of them knew that I was {{p2}} going to take this trip. They do not know even now where I have been and what I have been doing but such was their faith in Abdul Baha that knowing of course that I was sent by him none of them asked any question. They just greeted me as though I had never left with the warm enthusiasm of the East and the conversation started as usual, the subject being immortality of the soul and the scientific proof which the Master had explained in his recent talks. One of them gave me a notion in regard to the pre-existence {{p3}} of the spirit. He said, the spirit of man has a potential pre-existence in the world of God's Ideal Knowledge. Likewise the rays of the sun have an Ideal Existence in the Sun. Now the sun shines upon the rock and upon the mirror. The mirror is nothing but a higher evolution of the rock; yet it reflects in the former and has no effect upon the latter. It is evident that when a number of composite beings go through the process of purification until they obtain capability, the spirit manifests itself, just as {{p4}} the sun becomes reflected in the mirror as soon it is turned toward it. The spirit like the sun powers down its rays continuously. It happens that a transparent glass comes before it - that is, a body has been made ready through the law of composition - then, most naturally the spirit takes possession of that prepared which just like the sun reflecting itself in the mirror. So, you see there is no descent of the spirit from some mysterious reservoir or an unknown region.

{{p5}}

The Master coming out of his room I kneel before him and kissed his feet and hands. Ah! His voice was raised and his eyes twinkled - "You have returned, when did you arrived?" I answered: about one hour ago. He asked two more short questions and went to his room again. At ten o'clock dinner or rather supper was served. There were many Persians present and all sat at his table. There was a young Arab Bahai who was studying in Switzerland and had come to meet the Beloved. {{p6}} I wake this morning while the train was speeding along. All day we traversed through well cultivated French territory and now and then I spoke with my travelling companions who were most pleasant and had buoyant spirits. One of them was the wife of a Parisian Florist who had been in Amenia for two years. This gave me a clue to speak to her about the Cause and she listened with much interest.

I can now truthfully say that I have travelled from one end of France to another; for in Monte Carlo you are in an independent {{p7}} principality. There you see on one side the mountains of Italy and on the other side the French territory.

The great pleasure on my arrival was the reading of your letter and that of Louise. They gave me the good news of the Cause and the interest with which the news of the Master's trip is received. All thanks belong to you and Louise, for you are the ones who are doing the splendid work of typewriting. Your letter has many questions. I will try to answer as many of them as possible and ask some of them from the Beloved. {{p8}} You see, often I do not take extensive note from the private interviews of the people, but those that have a general aspect I try to give them to you. In the hurry of writing a letter, every day I do not have time to read them over so I leave the literary ornamentation to you and Louise. All the friends are well. They tell me the meetings have been well attended and the interest is growing much. The Master is slowly breathing in them the spirit of life and light.

Love to all

Dear Harriet!

"The Flower is the joy of life and the joy of life is the Flower." As in the material world we enjoy the fragrance of the rose and we inhale the perfume of the anemones, so our nostrils must become clear from cold in order that we may inhale the sweet odour of the Spiritual Flower. Just as our ear is attuned to hear and appreciate the delicate tones of a Beethoven Sonata or the lofty symphonies of a Wagner opera or the rich melodies of a celebrated singer, so also our spiritual ear must be attuned to listen to {{p2}} softest and remotest strains of the heavenly Singer and to catch the ravishing, fleeting expressions of the divine Artist who ever plays the celestial music on his invisible Instrument and whose choir is the modulated voices of thousand sanctified souls throughout the world. Have we not long listened to the vibrating rustle of his voice and the tender cadence of his music? Have not his jewelled utterances like unto the glorified aeolian chords of the ancient bands enraptured our utmost hearts? Often with attentive ears, have we not heartened to his sweet strains, fuller grown, always rising to rounder and clearer height {{p3}} and dancing along, now in mirthful measures, now in serious beautiful tones, again in prophetic words and then in immortal songs of human brotherhood. Have we not listened to the high and lofty tone of universal Religion and the golden vision of an era when war shall be no more? How his words are rapt by soaring themes, wrapt in the white lights of heaven! Strange melodies these to the unaccustomed ears of man, full of mysteries and inspiration. For does he not touch all chords of being, life and immortality, rising and sinking in measured melodies always divine? When we listen to the magical songs of our {{p4}} divine Artist, do not our souls rise higher and higher toward the gleaning pinnacle of his celestial lyre? Not only man, but all the earth seems full of ears, the woods, the hills and the skies all listening to his subtle harmonies, weaving round and round the hearts of all races and all nations. Oh singer divine! Oh heavenly Artist! How thy breath is fragrant! How thy rhyme is sweet! How deeper and deeper thou dost search! How higher and higher thou dost soar, filling the earth and heaven with the gentle breeze of the Love of God, mystic, calm, peaceful! For is it not true that under the soothing music of Thy thousand {{p5}} voiced lyre, Kissed with the lips of Baha-ollah, sweeter and sweeter this life becomes? Does it not transforms all hearts and glorifies all humanity to something so nearly divine? Do we not hear now and then, some fair faint echoes of Thy heavenly harps, encouraging us to make our ears Keener till we hear clearly the voice of Brotherhood which is breaking forth into rich notes of light and colours? Are not all Thy strains of love; love striving, love climbing, love ascending, love soaring, love triumphant, love defied? Is not Thy song, the song of Life, the anthem of Peace, the hymn of Joy? Lo! Lo! Hearken! Do we {{p6}} not hear the ravishing song of our divine Artist? Are not his plays, now tragedy, again drama and then divinely beautified? Are not all the voices hushed, and all the hearts attentive? For now the secret cells and the hidden chambers of the universe are displayed before our eyes! Do we not see the bright angles of heaven descending? Are we not aware of His Holy Presence? Do we not behold the reflex hues of the Kingdom of God around us? Are we not stirred by the tender Breeze of the Holy Spirit? O ecstasy! O happiness of him who once has heard Our Master-Artist, chanting the {{p7}} song of praise and glorification to God, for then to his ears the sound of grasser music dies and all the earth is full of sudden undertones which captures the listener and transforms him.

Have we not experienced that when He plays on His Invisible Harp of Love, each chord of being is touched and all the hidden lives stand open before his resonant voice, as the parched earth yawns to drink the summer rain and at the call of those refreshing waters all their souls stir from their undiscovered depths and burst into sweet fragrant flowers and from their wells. {{p8}} Deep calls to Deep and the mystery of all that is, lay unfolded?

O godlike Artist! From Thy song of Love and Joy, the sea of songs shall be set in motion and its mighty ebb and flow will go on from eternity onward to eternity. Then the inmost heart of Thy song shall set in motion, the waves of the most great sea. A race of heavenly bands, a multitude of divine Artists whose songs of life and anthems of Peace shall soar to Thy Throne, perfuming the world with their subtle fragrances, shall be born as the great children of Thy Song. Then their {{p9}} music shall set aglow the hearts of men. They shall strive to say what they have heard from Thee and about Thee, and with a voice worth for such a high message.

Oh more is than ease, palace and pomp, havocs and luxuries to have seen the Presence of Our divine Artist and to have hearkened to the glorious Voice of the Eternal God singing the Song of Life, the Song of Love, the Song of Peace!

This morning the Master at the tea have related the ancient tales and historical records of the Crusaders, {{p10}} the conflict which raged between the Mohamedans and the Christians; of the taking of Spain by the Mohamedans, the establishment of a wonderful civilization and the founding of many universities. His tales were most vivid and each one brought have a great lesson. During the last eleven month that I have been constant in his Presence I have heard him on various occasions relating a different story, either historical or from life, to illustrate his point. He has an endless fund of these stories. His is a {{p11}} wonderful power, the like which has never been witnessed.

At ten o'clock, Miss Bernard with her two adopted Hindou boys entered the room. The boys are not more than twelve years old. The Master received them in his private room. They sang for him some Hindou songs. He encouraged them to apply themselves to study, so that they may be well educated and the return to India to impart their acquired education to others. To Miss Bernard the Master said: In reality {{p12}} she was taking good care of them. God was very pleased with her. Those boys were the lamps lighted with her hands. I loved them very much. He asked them whether they like Paris or India. They said, they love both. A long lives of new people, called Our Beloved, having their private Interviews and when they come out they are happy and satisfied with the Master's words.

{{p13}}

It was noon when our Beloved came out and gives on divine discourse on the "Religion of the future", detailing the elements which are essential to make the universal religion permanent and effective in this modern rushing civilization. It was a masterpiece and it ranked high with many other wonderful addresses by him of late.

I have received copies of the Monthly Theosophic Messenger; one containing the Master's address in full and others have Bahai address and his photo. {{p14}} As he played on Vina which is a kind of oriental violin, he was singing Persian Songs. It was most interesting and the Master praised him for his work. Then the history of music and its origin was set forth by the Beloved, giving us the names of many instruments, singers to. He told us three stories of the celebrated Persian musician and how they were graduated from the Conservatories.

Dear Harriet!

To a group of Persians Abdul Baha said that one drop of deed was better than a sea of words. We must work, we must strive, we must try to do something in the Cause no matter how small. In the Bahai movement, all the friends must work in order to accomplish what they claim. I pray to God that all of us may become assisted in service. The crying need of the social body is for laborers and not theorizers. The characteristic phase of the human consciousness in this enlightened age is {{p2}} the evolution of the idea of social service in all its branches and the incubation of this idea as a religious principle - service is worship - labor is devotion - work is prayer. The Bahai Movement is the mighty trumpet which calls together under one banner. All the Comrades of Service, who work in diverse spheres for the coming of Divine Humanity on earth. All those who respond must naturally do so with a pure purpose, disinterested, "strong in will to strive, to seek, to find" the secret of beauty in work and service. The silent forces which underlie {{p3}} this divine Cause are modifying humanity from moment to moment and suffering it to ascend higher and higher till it reaches to a mysterious triumphant finale, full of glory and perfection.

This morning the Beloved speaking of Doctor Mehdi Khan of Rasht who was present said: His very being is a service to the Cause of God. He has been visiting the Master for several days. Mirza Ali Akbar Rafsanjany, a young man of probably 28 years old but a speaker of note in the Cause {{p4}} chanted some wonderful prayer from Baha'o'llah. His voice was musical and his chanting effective. I never had heard one chanting commune with such sweet and soothing voice. He made us forget all our troubles and worries. He was full of fire and zeal. I loved him very much. These divine mornings in the Presence of the Beloved are really wonderful. He closes his radiant eyes and listens to chanting. He is in the utmost state of supplication toward God. Such days can never be duplicated again in the history of this life!

{{p5}}

The Beloved entered his room and I read to him portions of a letter. Three questions were answered. 1st question: What is the real meaning of the 19 days feast, spiritual and material?

Answer: "Nineteen days are according to 19 Letters of the Living" which is composed of the Bab and 18 disciples. The spiritual aim of this Feast is that at every 19 days, the believers of God may gather together; engage in mentioning "Him whom God shall manifest - Baha'o'llah and be reminded of the Testament and the Covenant. Its {{p6}} material meaning is that every person or number of persons who are able, may arise to serve the believers of God and spread before them spiritual and material food"

2nd question. About spiritual communication.

Answer. "It is a spiritual revelation, for the human spirit reveals the realities of things. 

3rd question: Love from God to God.

Answer. It is the beholding of the beauty of this perfection in the reality of this own Identity. It is from the entity of God to His Own Entity. This is the Origin of Love, the Source of Love, the basis of Love, the {{p7}} quintessence of Love, the ancient Love and the eternal Love. Through one of the emanations of this Love, the world of existence has come into being.

When the letters have arrived for the interviews, people were taken in the Master's room, sometimes by Mon. Dreyfus, sometimes by Madame Dreyfus, so I cannot really give any idea of what the Master talks and says. For the present we losts so much. The teachings {{p8}} of the Master, whether given to an individual or to a concourse of people have more or less a general application; especially his encouraging advice and exhortations. However, these days we have more French people coming and going. The Master said, if we have five enthusiastic French Bahais they would have served the Cause in Paris and we hope that God will bring them forth and inspire their hearts. At noon he came out and gave a talk on "divine and human music". He again played {{p9}} in his invisible Harp his scales higher, his notes full of rich, vibrating colors of life, now his hands rising as to strike a powerful or gentle note according to the laws of the divine Harmony; again his eyes were shut, his voice falling to a sweet soothing level, he carried his audience to the very summit of the Grandeur of Melody. I wish you could hear him today. His closing advice was not to run after the hurdy-gurdy in the street, after you have heard the heavenly Artist; not to listen to false music after you have listened to the charm of Celestial Melody. {{p10}} How ignorant are these people, he ended the mighty oratories with a rush and tumult "that they do not advance to such a glorious sun but they are satisfied with a dimly-lighted candle. They have abandoned the great ocean and they run after the dark, muddy streams. They do not listen to the divine enrapturing melody of the Supreme Concourse but they run wild over a piece of cheap and gross music! Play on the heavenly lyre. O ye friends! Sing the melodies of the Kingdom, perchance these sleepy ones may become {{p11}} awakened; these deaf ones be endowed with the power of hearing; these blind ones become seeing and these dead ones become quickened.

Shaking hands with all these who were present he went out of the room, leaving behind him an atmosphere of holiness, a calm spirit of reality. Oh! although we were listening to the heavenly Nightingale, warbling in the sweetest tone, the mystic music of God. The most delicate strains of his voice were Kissed by the angels and were upborn again to the high station of Reality. The ears {{p12}} of men and women of this generation are not yet refined enough to catch the subtle movements and notes of this Celestial Warbler. For in his Repertoire there are a hundred thousand melodies and harmonies which the present world is incapable to hear.

In as much as many of our Persian brothers were leaving for Persia, it was arranged that a photo be taken in the Presence of the Beloved near the Eiffel Tower. There were about 20 present and we all started for {{p13}} the Eiffel Tower, only 5 minutes distant. The photograph was taken and I hope it will turn out to be alright.

The Master wanted to walk alone, so we returned home by another road. In the afternoon many prominent Persians who were formerly very influential in Persia came to see the Master. While he was talking to them suddenly the door bursts open and in rushed a Persian, like a whirlwind, run to the {{p14}} Master, kissed his hands, threw himself at his feet meanwhile talking. He asked his permission to read a poem and with a loud voice he recited a wonderful eulogy to the amazement of all those who were present. We were much impressed by his words. He came at the psychological moment. I took a copy of his poem and may translate it later on. At six o'clock Haji Ameen his two companions, Aga Meer Abdullah, Mirza Mohammed Khan, Doctor Mehdi {{p15}} Khan, Mirza Vaballal Khan and his brother Mirza Azzijallal Khan left for Persia. I was so sorry to leave them. The Master send all of us to the station to bid them farewell. 

From the station we returned to the house of Mon Dreyfus. Every friday night a public meeting is held. The three rooms were crowded, many Europeans and Persians were standing. Mon Dreyfus {{p16}} was reading, then Mon. Bernard talked in eloquent French. The Beloved spoke on how the appearance of the Divine Manifestations is to bring "Happiness" to the world of humanity, finally giving a detailed history of the Life of Baha-o-llah. He thought it to end with a wonderfully moving supplication.

He shook hand with everybody, mixing with the audience and blessing everyone. Tonight he was very tired. Before speaking he told me he is so fatigued that he could not say a word, but his words breathed life and strength.

Love to all
Ahmad

### Paris, February 7th, 1913.

Abdul Baha entered the room this morning saying: Good morning, and asking the health of the little group. As He seated Himself in His usual chair by the window a band of noisy street urchins held forth just below. A girl in the flat above was practicing on the piano. The result was a fantastic pandemonium. Abdul Baha sat perfectly quiet until the noised ceased, and still looking out the window, gave the following talk on music.

{{p18}}

Last night a Hindou professor of music came here, bringing his musical instrument called The Vina and played for us certain oriental strains, accompanying them with singing - overhead our neighbour was playing the piano; but as soon as the professor began playing, the piano became silent; and when the Hindou had finished playing we heard again the sound of the piano. This illustrates a lesson, namely that when we listen to a most beautiful song, we must forget inferior music - when a lover of music has listened to the entrancing notes of a great master, his love of music will no longer be satisfied with the playing of The pupil. If he listens to him it would be a proof of ignorance and show a lack of artistic appreciation - moreover he would not receive any spiritual uplift. Let us suppose that the most accomplished artist of Paris is playing for us in this room, inspiring the hearts by immortal songs and charming our souls with sweet celestial harmonies. Is it possible then for anyone of us to leave this room afterwards and going through the street to stop to listen to the crack notes of a hand organ. If we were to stop to listen to such sounds, it would indicate that we were unable to appreciate the wonderful melodies of the great master we had just listened to.

Today many melodies are being heard in the world. From every studio divergent strains are floated in the air but many of these melodies are become antiquated and covered with the mass of time. For thousands of years these notes have been heard and they have lost their original charm and purity, for the singers have grown old, are decrypted and have lost their voices. The songs of life have been so much changed with time that no longer any one can recognize them. In short from every direction these {{p19}} various melodies are being sounded. We must have appreciative ears to find out which one is the more beautiful and artistic. Let us find out the melody, the sweet strains of which will be taken up by angels and carried to The Supreme Concourse - Let us hearken to a Melody which may stir the world of humanity so that they may dance with joy. Let us listen to a strain which gives life to man. Then we can obtain universal results. Then we shall become illumined.

But if we want to listen to all different kinds of music we will have nothing but discord, for they are being played by inferior artists. If we want to run after such distracting sounds we will be lost in a wilderness of deprivation.

Therefore let us investigate a song which is superior to all other songs - which develops the spirit and which unfolds the inner potentialities of life. Such a song produces harmony and exploit oration.

It has been proven that whenever this song is raised, the world of humanity is quickened with new vibrations and the realm of existence receives a new cease of life. The sphere of thought is rejuvenated - sciences are resonated. The world of morality is resuscitated and humankind is unaired into a new era of civilisation and refinement. Again and again this has been experienced; its results are the records of past history. We must not run after untraced melodies, the results of which are less certain or we may fail in our pursuit. Perchance the effects of such music may not be praise worthy. Perhaps such melodies may not have the sweet qualities which are the characteristic indications of a true melody. Therefore let us search and find out the one glorious song which has run throughout all ages with thousands of entrancing accompaniments, the effect of which have changed millions of human beings.

{{p20}}

Often has the seed been sown and as a result many harvests have been gathered. Now it is well for us to overlook this good seed and try to sow another seed which has never been tried before for instead of a harvest we may reap only thorns and thistles. A course of treatment which has been tried a thousand times and has always healed the sick ones: is it wise for us to relinquish it and go for consultation to charlatans? This is no result gained by trying all kinds of medicines when we know of a certainty that this course of treatment is beneficial. When the right medicine is prescribed and we have seen that others have been healed, why should we try unknown remedies?

It is evident and manifest that the world of humanity cannot be rejuvenated through weak instrumentalities. Except through the power of God, humankind cannot be unborn as a whole with divine virtues. The surface of the Earth cannot be warmed entirely by the rays of the sun. These may be lamps, torches or electric lights and these are even the countless stars and the planets but notwithstanding all these lights, this globe in its entirety cannot be illumined. It is only through the rays of the sun that the various kingdoms of life on this earth are being warmed and lighted. Therefore let us follow the sun so that we may become illumined.

There was a time when this sun appeared from The Eastern horizon, it is the time when the mantle of winter had fallen over the meadows and pastures. The soil was black, as soon as the sun rose from its dawning place, flooding the regions with light, thus the gentle breezes wafted. The clouds of mercy poured down. Winter was ended - spring appeared. The meadows and prairies became verdant and all the trees were adorned with blossoms - multicoloured roses and hyacinths perfumed the air. The trees attained fruition and the world inhaled the fragrance of the flowers. The surface of the earth was transformed. This world became the mirror of the Kingdom and this lower sphere expressed the virtues of the higher world. These have always been the results whenever the Sun of Reality dawned.

{{p21}}

It is fitting that we turn our backs on The Sun and hold to the flickering dim light of a candle? Is it right to forget the boundless sea to run after a little brook? Is it good for us to neglect the luscious fruits of this tree and run wildly in the jungle collecting wild fruit? Is it not short-sightedness on our heart to fling away the quick healing remedy and take into our system a poisonous drug? Is it not weakness to renounce the skillful physician and go to a charlatan?

Praise be to God, the sun of reality has shown forth, illuminating all the continents with its refulgent rays - warming all the cold bodies and causing vegetation in the Earth. The flowers of the Kingdom are springing up in the East and the West, in the North and the South - now consider, how very negligent are the people for they do not turn towards the sun but they try to illumine themselves with dim lamps. They have forgotten the waves of the most Great Sea and they try to allay their thirst at dried-up streams. They do not listen to the soul stirring music of the Supreme Concourse but they run wild with joy over the jarring notes of a hand organ.

Strive day and night - purchase these sleeping and may be awakened. These blind ones may see and the dead arise! Let us listen to the soft tender music which is streaming down from the Kingdom of Abha!

Dear Harriet,

The Divine Alchemist is in Paris. Through his spiritual mystery he changes the copper into gold. For ages people have tried to find out this secret but none succeeded but we have found a Person in Paris whose daily work is to transfusion of the laser metals into pure gold. It seems to us that he has the great secret of this science of metallurgy. He is the master-metallurgist of this age and all ages to come. He does his work so simply {{p2}} that those who see Him at his work are led to believe that there is no secret about it at all. No dark chambers for this Alchemist of the 20th century! He is in need of no laboratory. He does not care for compound and simple. He works in the open, before the eyes of all the people of the world. Everyone has an opportunity to learn his secret, but we have met yet very few who can master it. His laboratory is the hearts of men. His secret is the Love of God and the Love of man. Today I like you to stand quietly aloof from the crowd and watch the faces of those who {{p3}} go in and those who come out of his laboratory. It is a study that you seldom forget. Here is a woman, there is a man, then a lady with two boys, one by one they enter, eager to learn the secret of the Alchemists. They have loads of copper, brass, tin etc and they want to change all these into pure gold. Now wait a few moments outside. The process of transmutation is going on. The Alchemist is at work. He blows over each one of these the breath of life, their metals are cast into the burning furnace; the fire is red hot and lo! After awhile we have the pure gold. How did he do it? {{p4}} At what stage of the purification did he applied the secret low? Here they come out of the laboratory. Their eyes are dancing with joy, their hearts palpitating with bliss. Wonderful! You exclaim! What a change! What a transformation! The metals are turned into gold. At first they were black, now they have become luminous, they were cold, now they have become warm. Whereas formerly they were hard, they have now become gentle. Blind were they, now they can see. Deaf were they, now they are able to hear. Dead were they, now they are quickened. What a miracle!

{{p5}}
For two hours the Alchemist works trying to demonstrate his claim not by word but by practical demonstration. Do you wonder then, because people believe in him? They see with their own eyes that which the senses can prove, the intellect substantiate, the Holy Books verify and divine inspiration validates. Is there any doubt in this? Can anyone discredit it? On all the occasions he spends his time to teach us these mysteries of the Kingdom, so that we may also in a limited degree learn and apply his laws. At noon he came out of his work-shop and {{p6}} unfolded to an interested audience how "all the religious of the world are agreed upon the fact that there must always be a medium between God and man." Then he develops this idea from stage to stage till he reaches to the point where no one could doubt the necessity of a divine manifestation, the need of a heavenly Educator.

In the afternoon many prominent Persians came to see the Master. He spoke about war between Turkey and the Allies and gave a minute history of Montenegrins.

{{p7}}

About 4 o'clock  Mr. Dryfus sent an auto for the Master to take a ride. As the Persians had just arrived He asked me and Mirza Mahmoud to go out and enjoy the ride. We rode through Bois de Boulogne, crossed the river St. Cloud and returned to our apartment. The Parisians love their Bois de Boulogne and it is indeed very beautiful. Here and there one witness glorious lakes. On our return the Persians were still here and the Master was just talking to them. 

{{p8}}

Tonight no one came and the Master spent his time in the room reading letters answering some of them and sending cables to various quarters.

At ten o'clock we had dinner. There were several Persians and two Bahai Arabs present. These Arabs are taught by Mirza Abul Fazl and now they are studying in  Luzanne, Switzerland. The Master is giving much of his energy and thoughts to Paris all the time. When the soil is full of thorns and thistles, the work of the farmer is much harder.

Love to all always.

Dear Harriet!

The spiritual edifice, the foundation of which the Master laid last year in Paris and is again fortifying it this year, shows signs of visible growth. As the Architect of the structure, he has come to supervise the work of the masons. This Edifice would be soon completed, even we in possession of energetic persistent workers and the right kind of materials. The architect has not only given us the plan but painstakingly, he travels through the world to see {{p2}} how the work is progressing, to encourage the labourers, to inspire the hearts of those who have lost their consistency. Now he has reached Paris and already we observe, signs of new activities and interest in various directions. Religionist and philosophers, Scientists and Artists are gathering around the Architect in order that they may learn the details of his plan and them for each to give his own quota to the construction of the Edifice of Humanity. The different ways of examining the expressing life represent separate departments {{p3}} of this divine structure. For do we not see how the leaders of humanity in all quarters of the globe are unconsciously brought together? Because there is a similar state of consciousness underlying all sincere efforts in these spheres of thought and action. They are climbing the hill and are closing in and around the common citadel, the plan of which was drawn by the Universal Architect of our time and generation. On this Mountain of God, the Celestial Palace of Reality shall be founded; its towers shall uplift their heads to the blue, its tunnels shall rise aloft in their majestic beauty; its lights {{p4}} shall irradiate to all the regions, its audience-chamber shall receive the worthies of all the nations and its imperial halls shall shelter all the peoples and tongues. From this palace of God, the foundation of which Our Architect has laid and for the construction of which all the master-masons are called upon - there shall be raised the anthems of universal praise, reverberating through all climes and stirring the very inmost heart of every human being. May each one of us be privileged to work day and night until the glorious Palace of Universal Religion is completed!

This morning as we were drinking tea in the Presence of Our Beloved, he looked out of the window and with regret in his tone he said: How pitiful it is that man is satisfied with material things and so regulates his life as to gain more and more! He has made himself a "civilized animal," while the animals are uncivilized. The animals and birds from early morning till late in the evening are planning to gain food and grains; so also the people of this age are totally submerged in material affairs. It is strange that they are pleased {{p6}} with these trifling occupations. It is regrettable that the world of humanity is subjected to these afflictions; especially these countries that are so well built! The light of spirituality must shine from these regions and people become characterized with divine morals. They must become radiant beings, shining stars, luminous persons and angels of heaven. He was silent for a few moments, Mirza Ali Akbar Rafsonjany was chanting in a sweet voice the communes of Baha-o-llah, there stole over us a spirit of calmness and peace, the room was filled with the Fragrances {{p7}} of the Kingdom, the world and what it contained therein become as naught, we were as though immersed in a sea of light. When the chanting was over, the Beloved opened his eyes, looked out and said: "This is a good day. We commenced it with the sun." We were made happy as we looked out we beheld the phenomenal sun with all its rays - soft - tender - smiling upon the world and as we looked in and we saw the Sun of Reality, shining and radiant. Thus we were going to start the day with the dawn of two Suns - illumining the exterior and interior worlds of nature and intellect. {{p8}} This being Sunday we had many people. As usual at ten o'clock the interviews started and men and women and many with their children had the privilege of meeting Abdul Baha. There was a woman who had a little sweet girl. When she entered the door of the Master, she run to him putting her little hands around his neck and trying to hug him. And to our surprise, slowly she said the following words distinctly: {{p9}} "Abdul Baha I love you. I will try to be a good Bahai"

There was a woman who at first was very antagonistic and was clamouring to keep her own Jesus Christ, afraid that the Master was going to take Him away from her. "My Christ is enough for me" she said determinedly as she entered in the Presence of the Beloved. After a few minutes she came out weeping. What has happened? Oh! She had found her Jesus Christ. Now for the first time in her life she loved the Christ up to this time. She was worshipping a concept of the Christ, but now she had the Reality. She was radiant; {{p10}} She is happy; because the Beloved gave her such a glorious idea of her own Christ that she was transformed.

At noon the King of Kings with majesty and authority sitting on his brow came out with innate simplicity and yet divine grandeur. All arose. There was a large gathering. He touched upon a lofty theme, glowing with burning words and convincing utterances. He spoke on the Existence of God; he piled one upon another the irresistible proofs of science, art, physics, chemistry, and step by step he carried us through the {{p11}} labyrinths of nature, until we realized in our own soul, the existence of God! This was a wonderful talk, one that every Bahai should memorize every word of it. For it is evident that upon the existence of God - life and religion are based.

After the lecture he passed by the little girl to whom I referred and took her in his arms amidst the delight and happiness of all. He carried her to his own room as placing her on a chair offered <12> her candy. The parents then were called in and he placed a very precious rosary around her little neck. She was happy over it and kissed it spontaneously and run to him again. With her small hands around the Beloved's neck she repeated: "Abdul Baha, I love you. I will try to be a good Bahai.

Sayad Assadillah {{p13}} served the lunch and we were all happy to sit around his heavenly Table.

In the afternoon the wife of Gabriel de Sacy with her four daughters came to visit the Master. Gabriel de Sacy was a very great Bahai. He wrote a treatise on the Cause and died a few years ago. The Master loved him very much, and told to the members of his family: His value will be Known in the future. He enkindled for you a lamp which shall never be eating wished. He laid for you a foundation which shall not be destroyed throughout centuries and cycles. He planted for you a tree whose,

She was very much interested. "I am a simple chamber-maid but I can see that he was a very great man, a very spiritual man." She told me when the Master started to walk. He took a carriage and for one hour we drove through the lighted avenues. Meanwhile he spoke to me on his early life and that of Baha-o-llah. Returning I read to him a Bahai article published in "the Path."

### ADDRESS BY ABDUL BAHA on the Existence of GOD.
### Delivered Sunday morning Feb. 9th, 1913. At 30 Rue St. Didier, Paris.

Translated from Persian notes by Ahmad Sohrab.

Today someone asked a question regarding the existence of God. What are the proofs to which one can establish the existence of God?

People are divided into two sections, one which is satisfied with the knowledge of the attributes of Divinity, and the other which strives to establish the existence of Divinity, and be informed of the fundamental principles of divine philosophy.

Therefore today I will speak to you of the proofs which establish scientifically the existence of God.

I will not quote to you the scriptural proofs from the Old and the New Testament or the Koran, for you are more or less familiar with those ideas. Consequently I will deal with this subject from an intellectual standpoint. As it is an abstruse subject I request you to give your utmost attention.

When we look upon all forms of phenomena we observe that they are the results of composition. For example certain single atoms are brought together through the inherent law of elective affinity existing between these various particles, the result of which is the human being. A number of primordial atoms have gone into the makeup of a plant, the result of which is the flower.

Again looking into the mineral kingdom we observe that this law of cohesion is working in the same manner in that Kingdom, for we see that many atoms go into the composition of a piece of stone which through purification may reach to the state of mirror.

In short the existence of life depends upon the composition and decomposition of phenomena. When the particles of a given composition are disintegrated this may be called non-existence, but the original simple atoms will go back to their primary elements and are ever existent.

For instance the body of man being the resultant factor of the composition of these atoms when this body becomes the subject of decomposition we call that death, but those atoms through which the body of man was composed, being simple and primordial they are indestructible. Consequently it is proven that the existence of phenomena depends upon composition and their mortality upon decomposition.

{{p18}}

This is a scientific principle, science approves of it, because it is not a matter of belief. There is a great difference between theories upheld by belief, and facts which are substantiated by science.

Beliefs are the susceptibilities of conscience, but scientific facts are the deductions of reason and inexorable logic.

Therefore it is logically proven that the existence of phenomena depends upon composition, and their destruction upon disintegration.

Now going back to our subject and the facts upheld by materialists. They state that in as much as it is proven and upheld by science that the life of phenomena depends upon composition and their destruction upon disintegration, then where comes in the need or necessity of a Creator? The Self-subsistent Lord.

For we see with our own eyes that these infinite beings go through myriads of compositions and in every composition appearing under a certain form showing certain characteristic virtues, then we are independent of any divine Maker.

This is the argument of the materialists. On the other hand those who are informed with divine philosophy answer in the following terms.

Composition is of three kinds.

1 Accidental composition.

2 Involuntary composition.

3 Voluntary composition.

There is no fourth kind of composition. Composition is restricted to these three categories.

If we say that the composition is accidental, this is philosophically a false theory, because then we have to believe in an effect without a cause. We cannot think of an effect without some primal cause, and composition being an effect, there must naturally be a cause behind it.

As to the second composition, i.e. the involuntary composition. Involuntary composition means that each element has within it, as an inherent function, this power of composition. For example certain elements have flowed towards each other, and as an inherent necessity of their being they are composed. That is, it is the immanent need of those elements to enter into composition.

{{p19}}

For example the inherent quality of fire, is burning or heat. Heat is an original property of fire.

Humidity is the inherent nature of water. You cannot conceive of H.2.O which is the chemical form of water without having humidity connected, for that is its inherent quality, inseparable and indivisible.

Now as long as it is the inherent necessity of these elements to be composed, there should not be any decomposition, while we observe that after each composition of organism there is a process of decomposition we learn that the composition of the organism of life is neither accidental or involuntary. Then what have we as a form of composition? It is the third, that is the voluntary composition, and that means that the infinite forms of organism common through a superior will, the Eternal will, the Will of the Living and Self-subsistent Lord.

This is a rational proof, that the Will of the Creator is affected through the process of composition. 

Ponder over this carefully. When you comprehend the significances of this subject you will then be able to convey it to others. The more you think over this the greater will be your comprehension.

Thank ye God that He has given you such a power through which you can comprehend these divine mysteries. Reflect deeply, ponder carefully, think minutely, and then the doors of knowledge shall be open unto you.

Finis.

Dear Harriet!

The body of the world is afflicted with many sicknesses which has made the patient weak, pallid and feverish. As there are many ills, complication has set in. The physicians have been unable to diagnose the case. They have had many consultations but have failed to discover the root of the impurity of the blood and the anemic state of the patient. They are too-short sighted and their pathological knowledge {{p2}} too limited. But the divine Physician has come and with His immediate wisdom, received from the All-Healer He is attending the patient, diagnosing the case and prescribing the quick-healing remedy. He is the Great authority on all the departments of ancient and modern schools of therapeutics. In his pharmacopiea, you find every medicine which takes away all the ills of the body polity. His clinic is overcrowded day and night. He does not charge any fee; for His reward is with God. He calls on all the Invalid's {{p3}} Tenderly, lovingly, he inquires about the health of each patient and then with gentleness and compassion, he prescribes the course of treatment. He works all the time, and his patients love him passionately. He performs some miraculous surgical operations and he brings into life the seemingly hopeless cases. When all the doctors give up a patient, he comes to his rescue and breathes in him the breath of life. How well he Knows the need of every sick as soon as he looks into his face. {{p4}} His hospital is the wide expanse of the earth. His patients are from amongst all tongues and nations. His is the only power to understand each one, to advise each person and set each soul toward the path of recovery and health. Those who follow truly his prescription are immune against every kind of diseases. They will become in turn true physicians of the world of humanity. For have they not studied under the wise guidance of the heavenly Physician? Have they not attended his clinics? Have they not listened to his lectures depicting the sicknesses of the social body and prescribing the wisest course of treatment?

Today at half-past nine Our Beloved called Mirza Farajullah to go out with him; and returned at noon; all this time walking. On his return he received individually some of the friends who have been patiently waiting. Then he came out and spoke on two very important points. First: The principles which draw humanity closer together and Second: Those which create separation and remoteness amongst the children of men. Having developed these two clashing principles {{p6}} he unfolded to us the means whereby the first class of principles are affirmed and the second negated; the first upheld, the second kept down. This is the means of the oneness of the world of humanity. This is conducive to the propagation of universal Peace. This leads to the illumination of mankind. This confers eternal life. This is the magnet whereby confer nations are attracted. This is the Origin of the diffusion of the Fragrances of the Holy Spirit. Thus he finished his address inspiring the hearts with hope and Courage, constancy and firm resolution.

{{p7}}

One of the most interesting interviews was the one between the Beloved and a correspondent from one of the cities on Holland. He was a young man and much attracted to the Cause. After hearing the Master's address he told Him that he hoped to spread these principles in Holland and will do his best to acquaint the public. I hope the Master told him that he may be the means of the illumination of his country; may he bestow such a light upon his native land that may never extinguish! Consider, Our Beloved continued, the greatest gems in the military domain was Napoleon. The {{p8}} results of his conquest were limited and the end of his own life most unfortunate. But the conquest of a person who serves the Kingdom of God are unlimited; his dominion is eternal and his Sovereignty everlasting. Reflect and you shall realize that the Sovereignty of all the Kings have vanished and are vanishing but the Sovereignty of the Apostles is never-ending. Everything is limited except that thing which belongs to God. Therefore if they offer to a sage the acceptance of one of the two things: To be the emperor of the whole world {{p9}} or to be the herald of the Kingdom of God, without one second of hesitation he will joyfully accept the latter.


Miss Fraser with whom the Master is well pleased was invited to lunch. She is a sincere maid servant of Baha-ollah. While in London she was present every day and served the Cause in many ways. Then she was sent ahead to Scotland and again to Bristol. She is now with us in Paris, very devoted to the Cause. When we sat at the table the Master placed before her a plate full of rice and laughingly said in English: {{p10}} All this for you, you all eat. She laughs. "May I eat all this rice? It is too much for me." "Yes, yes." the Beloved said with a twinkle in his eyes, all this for you." Of course Miss Fraser happily accepted the Master's request and went for the plate of rice. After awhile we observed that she had proved herself to be an obedient child.

In the afternoon the Beloved drink tea, spoke to Miss Fraser and taught her how to cook oriental dishes. A few Persians arrived and he spoke with them on the recent events of that land. A letter received from {{p11}} America by our Persian friend Mirza Ebrahim Bazork Zadeh a day after his arrival in Paris was read to the Master. Mr Louis G. Gregory's booklet the "Heavenly Vista" was received and the Beloved was pleased with it. I have a package of nine copies to be divided amongst the friends tomorrow morning.

This afternoon there was a meeting in Mr Scott's studio, so we take the subway and the Master will go later. A large number of people were gathered. Where the Master arrived He asked one of the friends to speak. She spoke in French very eloquently and full of fire {{p12}} He spoke on the prophecies of the Old and New Testaments which are fulfilled in this Revelation and asked the audience to thank God because they were of the chosen ones and not of those who are called. Praise be to God, he concluded his words of wisdom and life, that the doors of the Kingdom of God were open before their faces. Then he rose from his seat, everyone got up and he began to shake hands with each, circulating amongst the crowd, his heavenly smile on his glorious countenance {{p13}} and continuing his remarks: The rays of the glorious Sun of Reality have cast their effulgence in their hearts. Now he was in another corner of the room: The Breathes of the Holy Spirit had influenced their souls. He shake hand with an old man and placed his hands admiringly on his long flowing beard. What beautiful beard he had. It was luminous white, again he soars to his lofty summit: He hoped that they would strive day and night and render adequate thanks to God for these Graces. For this is the most great Bounty! This is the Light of the Kingdom {{p14}} of God! This is the sign of the Divine Bestowals! Now he stood before a child. He kissed his cheeks, shake hand with the mother and went on. He was most pleased with them. He will pray for them, that the Divine Confirmations may descend upon them; the Omnipotence of God become manifest the lights of the Orb of Truth may shine; the traces of the almighty become apparent and the Breathes of the Holy Spirit may quickened each one. By this time he had blessed every one. It was a most impressive sight; a unique and thrilling {{p15}} experience that I will never forget. Going into other room he related to us a story illustrating how the different religionist hate each other. Once upon a time three groups; Musulmans, Christians and Jews embarked on a steamer. While in the middle of the ocean a tempest brake out; the wind was blowing and the passengers were thrown into utmost consternation. The Christians began to blame the Mohamedans and cried out, O God! destroy these Musulmans. They are infidels and they have brought upon us this calamity. {{p16}} May they be perished! For they are the cause of all these vicissitudes. The Mohamedans began to call down the Christians, O God! Destroy these Christians! They are most unworthy of Thy name! Cause them to sink to the bottom of the sea. The Jews huddled in one corner, were silent. Someone asked their leader. "Don't you have anything to say?" The Rabbi with upraised hands said: "O God! Answer the prayer of both these Musulmans and Christians! Fulfil their supplication! We ask Thee by Thy name to answer their invocation!" 

{{p17}}

On our return home there were several more Persians present. Madame D'astre was also invited to dinner. She was trying to arrange a large meeting for the Spiritualists of Paris before whose Society the Master spoke last year. The date was arranged to be either on the 18th or 19th. He entered the reception room. Somehow the discussion was turned upon dog. He gave an illuminating talk on the ten qualities of the dog and told us three stories in which the dog played an important part.

{{p18}}

Today I received a letter from a Bahai in Budapest, Hungary who encloses several invitations for the Master from the Hungarian Peace Society, Hungarian Esperanto Society, Orientalist School, Society of Scientist and British-American Society. All of them plead the Master to visit that country but he has not yet given definite answers. There are a few Bahais in Holland and they have supplicated the Master to go to their capital. These are the signs of a great interest in the cause all over Europe.

Speaking about Paris the {{p19}} Master stated that declared by God that ere long this Paris shall become like unto a rose garden. Mirza Hossien one of the Persians residents in Paris related several stories in connection with his flight from Constantinople, and going straight to Tiberius to meet the Master, after his flight from Constantinople the government authorities finding out where he has been asked Abdul Baha to give them his address but he could not give it to them and then caused much inconvenience. At the table the Beloved spoke about the early history of Islam and the conquest of a certain Jewish tribe.

{{p20}}

The evening was spent in pleasant conversation; the Master enjoying himself very much and laughingly receiving several funny stories.

Dear Harriet!

Man must open the eyes of "wonder". If he does not enjoy the eyes of "wonder" his whole life will be fruitless. By the eyes of wonder, the Beloved means we must appreciate the Bounties of God. There are so many miracles which are performed daily by the Almighty but man having been used to see them all the time, ceases to "wonder" at them, so that he does not praise God because of their off-recurrences. The sun which dawns every day from the Eastern horizon is a miracle of God. The breeze blowing over the field, refreshing the plant life is another miracle.

{{p2}}

The coming of the holy, divine manifestations of God upon this earth is the greatest of all miracles. They bestow life to the world of humanity. They quickened the dead and usher in a new order of civilization. Yet it seems that the people lack this eyes of "wonder". They cannot behold the divine glories of the Sun nor can they feel the vibration of the Spirit. How great is the eye of "wonder"! For through it the spiritual insight is opened, the sphere of thought is expanded, the vistas of ideas are mad straight and man is enabled to understand the mystery of the manifestation in this divine Day!

{{p3}}

This morning after having tea and listening to the glorious chanting of Mirza Ali Akbar, the Master asked him about the believers of Rafsanjan. He answered that they are all united, hold their meetings and are full of zeal and service in the Cause of God. They long to behold the Face of the Center of the Covenant and they desire to sacrifice their lives in his Path. It was very affecting to look at the Master while Mirza Ali Akbar was chanting. His eyes were shut, his whole divine expression was a wonderful Peace which passeth all understanding. Light and life emanated from His Countenance. When the chanting {{p4}} was over, he opened his eyes and with a voice infinitely tender, he said:- Our pathway is supplication and invocation, severance from all else save Him and communion with the Source of all benediction. If we are assisted in this we have attained if not, we have been deprived. In our estimation the foundation which is laid by the Blessed Perfection is the most important. Those principles of the world in comparison with His principles are as child-plays. The spirit must confer life and the life of man is through the spirit. All our efforts and motions are through the Spirit. The Blessed {{p5}} Perfection has upraised for us a tent, under which all nations and peoples may gather with the utmost love and joy.

Doctor Hisher of Stuttgart arrived this morning and had an interview with the Master. He presented to Our Beloved the plans and drawings of aero plane which is drawn by a German aviator and which is designed to be the trans-atlantic air ship to carry one hundred passengers from Europe to America. The designs were quite wonderful and intricate. The investor had requested the Master to bless his effort and Crown it with success.

{{p6}}

There are two small things which I like to inject here and which shows the Master's attention to the minutest details. While day and night he is busy teaching the Cause, he does not forget the practical side of life. For instance, he is going to buy small fruit and orange trees for the Blessed Tomb of Baha-ollah; also the seeds of many species of flowers. Likewise he expects to buy a fine watchdog for the Tomb of the Bab on Mount Carmel. While in America he got also some flower seeds.

{{p7}}

I received today several photographs of the Mosque in London with the picture of the large gathering and the Beloved on Centre and mailed one for the Star of the West.

There were many new faces amongst those who are coming to see the Beloved. All of them were bathed with the sunshine of His Love. He listened with the greatest of patience to the complaints and prayers of every one. No one ever leaves His Presence {{p8}}without his or her wishes are satisfied. At noon he entered the hall. Everybody arose to bid him welcome. He spoke on the degrees of perfection destined for every person and how a person will ever remain in the lowest degree of defect if he does not make an effort to advance. Then he spoke on Love! The greatest attainment in the world of humanity is Love, for it is through Love that man is attracted toward God. It id Love that establishes communication between the hearts of men; it is Love that confess eternal life; it is {{p9}} Love that bestows unfailing joy. If real Love appears in the heart of man, he will attract all the virtues. Love is the divine power which causes the ascension of man to all the heavenly station. As long as the heart is not illumined with the Light of Love, it is impossible for man to progress. Therefore they must strive day unto day that the sun of Love may dawn from their hearts; day unto day the attractions of their consciousness may develop; day unto day they may become more loving to humanity, day unto day they may establish more rapid means of communication {{p10}} between the children of men. In this exalted tone he continued his exhortations of love and loyalty. Everybody was moved by his appeal; and his divine advice and I have no doubt they were touched by the Power of the Holy Spirit which is in his every word. After this beautiful talk he went out with Doctor Mohamad Khan for his daily walk and returned at 2 o'clock. He had lunch and rested for a little while. He wake up at three, looking over a voluminous package of mail just arrived from the East. He had his tea and {{p11}} at four he went out with Mon Dreyfus, first calling on the photographer who took his photo last year for he had requested to take his profile from the photographer he went to Madame Sigfried, where Pastor Wagner, in whose church he spoke last year was going to meet him. A large number of people being present he spoke to them about the teachings. It was about 7 o'clock when he returned. I was playing the cook tonight so as soon as I was free he took me with hesitant we called on Mrs Sanderson. She is not feeling well and the Beloved visits her every few days.

{{p12}}

During the talk with Miss Sanders the Master, said that in a Bahai meeting both reading the Table and public speaking are necessary. A Bahai meeting must have both reading alone without speaking or speaking alone without reading is not enough. In praising her he said that he knew that she was pure, attracted, served and a Bahai. Her desire was to served the Cause. After speaking for a few moments with the Mother, we returned to the aport and we had our dinner. He spoke at the table about one of the martyrs of the Cause and retired to his room at 10 o'clock.

Dear Harriet!

As Abdul Baha was the honored guest given by the Esperanto Society of Paris this evening at the Hotel Moderne in Place de la Republique. It was a very interesting banquet and all those attending it could understand and speak of Esperanto. The President, Monsieur Carlo Bourlet spoke in Esperanto and the deniers comprehended every word. The Master entered the dining Hotel about 8 o'clock and received by the prominent Esperantists in a private room. There were two hundred guests. When everybody took his seat, the Beloved came out with the President and those who were going to sit at the speaker's table. The President read a few extracts from Abdul Baha's talk in on Universal Language translated into Esperanto and to be published in the February issue of Esperanto magazine called La Revere, a monthly publication. "It is with the greatest honor and privilege that we Esperantist receive Abdul Baha amongst us" the President opened his remark. "I have already read to you a few paragraphs of his marvelous address before the Esperanto Society in Edinburgh. From the way you applauded to know that you could understand Esperanto." Then facing the Master he said." We are all pleased that you have favored the Esperanto language and have commanded the Baha’is to study it. With your large following Priest, the language of Esperanto could very easily be spread. You have well said that a universal auxiliary language will be the greatest means of communications between the nations and that it will remove from amongst them all the present misunderstandings.

We have different opinions and various thoughts but in this age, the ideals which is silently for oneness of the world of humanity is one. We are all working fort the realization of that day. On the past of all the Esperantists of Paris I desire to express our deepest gratitude that notwithstanding your indesprocohon you have come amongst us. The guest started their dinners and the Master retired to the other room within an hour he returned and gave the following wonderful address on universal language. 

{{p2}}

It is always a blessing to receive the benediction of the Master every morning. To look into his face, to watch the infinite varieties of his expression, the lofty simplicity of his thought, the ineffable splendor and beauty of his love, the width and breadth of his views, the unshakable firmness of his faith, the luminous ideals of his mind, the eternal whiteness of his sympathy and the sweetness of his nature. These are the greatest heavenly reward for yearning a soul.

{{p3}}

Every morning I find the Master radiating joy and fragrance, happiness and serenity but today he was not happy. His forehead was furrowed with bris and he was sitting in a chair near the window in deep contemplation. Pausing his head he said that the enemies have surrounded him from every side. They have not left him one moment of rest. In the Orient and the Occident they are engaged in the intrigues and neachi nations against the Cause. But he does not say anything; because all these trials are in the path of God." I said: "It is true that the enemies are persecuting him from every side, but on the other side, there are confirmations of Bahaullah, the support of the supreme Concourse, the waftury of the Breath of the Holy Spirit, the Power and majesty of the Master, the spread of the Fragrances of God, and the springing up of the flowers of faith and assurances.

{{p4}}

He asked Mirza Ali Abbor to chant prayers. He chanted very effectively, his voice rising and falling to show the natural yearnings of the heart after the Grace of God. When he finished the Beloved said, that it was one may chant the prayers of Bahaullah. The Parisians were very heedless. They peen their time in the pursuit of worldly pleasures and amusements. The majority working all day, spend their earnings during the evening either on theatre, liquor or gratification of passion. They know nothing of God. Darkness has environed them. The darkness of religion, the darkness of moral and the darkness of heedlessness prevent men from seeing even their own hands. These are three waves of darkness, one over another. 

{{p5}}

Changing the tone of his voice he told a story of his child book the showing that even that early period he loved freedom. He said that whom he was very young, one day he was present in a meeting in which people discussed astronomy according to the theories of the old school of Ptolemy. The lecturer told his hearers that the planets revolved around it; that the earth and the seven planets were like unto seven larger of an onion one over the other. Abdul Baha was made very angry; because he thought he would be made a prisoner in one of these layers; the crowded planets with their heavy weights pressing over one another. It was a thought he was held a prisoner within a circumscribed limits of the earth. He got out of the meeting with a sad heart and for several days no one could change his mood. One day he was reading one the Fable of Bahaullah in which it was stated that this is "infinite space," that one statement made him very happy and he realized that he was no longer a prisoner within the limits of one world.

{{p6}}

About ten o'clock the friends and strangers started to come. I could see many new faces; chief amongst them four beautiful believers from Stuttgart who have come to escort nack the Beloved. They were Miss Ahna Knoblock, Anna Kasttni. From Schewizer and Her Ege. They have luminous faces, and wonderful faith. Each carried in the hand a bouquet of flowers to offer at the feet of one who is the Lover of humanity. When the Master heard who they were, he called them to his room. They had several petitions and the photograph of two young boy that the Master kissed several time. As they approach in the door, the voice of the Beloved of the sincere hearts was raised happily: "Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! "They were all weeping with joy. Addressing Miss Knoblock told her that she had two very good in America. They send her many Baha’i greetings and they are well. He said further that he wants to go to visit the friends of God in Stuttfort that she was most welcomed. While in America he constantly remembered him; he has never been out of his mind. Bravo! In reality she was the daughter of the Kingdom. The Stuttfort friends are like the brilliant candles. When he heard yesterday that that were coming he was made very happy."

Miss Knoblock said that the friends desire to arrange a Feast for him and he approved it. He stated that whenever a soul desires to become the means of good fellowship amongst the friends, we must encourage him. God loves those souls who are engaged in the service. Miss Knoblock said that the first lady in Stuttford who opened the way for teaching the cause wants to arrange this Feast in a hall. The Belonged said that those souls who with a pure heart, unalloyed in tention and attachment to Bahaullah arise to serve the Cause, the hasts of the angels will support them. Therefore let her tell so that the lady that Abdul Baha was most pleased with her aim.

When they left the Presence of the Master he said that the Cause of Bahaullah will make great profession in Germany. The friends in Stuttford are very firm and steadfast. Today many people had private interviews and at noon out and delivered an eloquent address, showing how Bahaullah was spreading the knowledge of Christ all over the world. One may say that He was doing the work that the missionaries do. Often the Master begins his address while sitting on a chair and then suddenly he gets up and striding back and forth, he speaks like a majestic King Eods of wisdom galling from his lips to be preserved carefully in the caskets of the hearts.

After the lecture one of the American ladies bringing her camera took the Master's photo while standing in the Balcony. In the afternoon Miss Fraser and Miss Sanderson came to see and various subjects were discussed such as publicity and the universal war which some people predict will occur in May.

Dear Harriet!

Our sojourn in Paris is being extended because more and more people are interested in the Cause. The daily meetings are well attended; the souls are becoming purified, the spirits are attracted to the Kingdom of Abha; the principles are being spread more widely, the circle of friends is widened. It is only his mighty power that can attract these indifferent souls to the Supreme Concourse, his spirituality, his love, his patience and his benevolence attract every one. He is scattering the seeds. If they are not growing immediately; in the future many harvests will be gathered. Then people will realize what a great Blessing has been destined for them.

{{p2}}

This morning he spoke about Mirza Yahya and his misdoings in the early period of the Cause. At the time that Bahaullah was in Bagdad, Mirza Yahya being afraid of his life, was seldom seen amongst the people. He had changed his clothes and tried in seclusion. Nobody could find him, on the other hand Bahaullah was in evidence all time. Once Bahaullah was left Bagdad and, and for two years no one knew where he was, because of his absence, the Cause become extinct. These was no life and enthusiasm in the hearts of the believers. But on his return he exclaimed: What is this: Open the door! Let everyone come in! He infused in the friends a new spirit. He rekindled the sire. All kinds of people were received by Him and they were in turn {{p3}} impressed with His knowledge and wisdom.  Day and night Bahaullah labored till new and better conditions were created. Then the good for nothing came out of their hiding places. Abdul Baha by God that where he frequently the fetters which were thrown around the blessed neck and feel Baha-u-llah of his very loves shiver. Years after word, when Baha-u-llah was in exile, he wrote a person a line of which expresses the idea that the signs of fetters and shackles were yet visible on His neck and feet. 

{{p3}}

When Baha-u-llah was taken out of this prison in Teheran, the Grand Vizir, Mirza Aga Khan who was not very much opposed to the Cause wanted to apologize for his Cause wanted to apologize for his course. On the head of Blessed Perfection there was felt hat, the top of which had gone through excessive use. The jailors wanted to change it but the Blessed Perfection did not let them. The Grand Vizir started meeting to an offer apology and express regret. "I am innocent helping whom you in all these misfortunes." He said, "You know that the enemies have misrepresented everything to Hid Majesty the shah, saying that you have built a show fortress outside of Teheran and have a collected 5000 people to attack the city. It is evident that when the Shab heard such reports he got angry and did what he pleased. "But did you send same one to investigate?” Baha-u-llah asked, "Whittier these reports were true or false?" "No" the Grand Vizir said, "Their it would have been much better if you had pursued such a course"

{{p4}}

These days after Baha-u-llah is return from Soleymanieh's mountain they walked out in the Bazaars of Bagdad. One of the shopkeepers, seeing Him walking with such majesty and glory, raised his head an astonishment and called aloud to his friends; "Look! How the Baha’is are appearing on the scene afraid." Bahaullah looking up asked imperatively. "What did you say?" and turning to believe who was following him said:" Punish his audacity." This believer slapped him hard on the face. The shopkeeper thinking that he was attack, tore to his clothes to vices and ran to the Persian Counsel, crying so and so. The Counsel told him that he must have done something wrong; otherwise Bahaullah would not have ordered his punishment, therefore he must be thrown into prison. Where the family of the shopkeeper heard this, they went, direct to the Blessed Perfection, pleading him to intercede for his liberation which Bahaullah did gladly.

{{p5}}

Another story which will be related here is of the childhood of Abdul Baha.

Where Bahaullah returned from his pilgrimage to Karleala the brother of the Grand Vizir Abbas Gali Khan, according to the custom of the country invited Him to stay with him the first few days of his arrived. Bahaullah accepted the invitation and took possession of the quarters which were preforced for him. This was as the time when the Baha’i Cause was under the greatest condemnation and the Grand Vizir condemnation and his brothers were at the height of their Power. The morning after Bahaullah's arrival, He was sitting in the drawing room receiving the callers. Many prominent people were present. Abdul Baha at that time still young was watching people coming and going. Suddenly it was announced that the brother of the Grand Vizir was coming. As soon as he appeared at the door he was so impressed by the majestic presence of Bahaullah that he knelt down before him in the presence of all those people. This was a cause of astonishment to all. Then the Master added the appearance of the Blessed Perfection was awe inspiring. Those who came into His presence knelt down against their own will. They could not held themselves. They were awe-struck by the wonderful power and authority which emanated from Him. 

{{p6}}

At ten o'clock the door of personal interviews was fling wide open. Our German friends were here again with bouquets of flowers. They were received by him and the Cause in Germany and its future promotion was discussed. Many people had personal visit who had been eager to hear his loving words. The sea of mercy was waving and the pearls of wisdom on shore of human existences on the shores.

{{p7}}

The address of the Beloved today was on the two functions of the spirit. The first functions of the spirit was through the instruments. The second function was without instrument. He went on explaining in details the two functions of the spirit. After his lecture, he went out with now. Dreyfus, had lunch with him in one of the large hotels and returned about half past three. Madame Bernard with her two Hindu boys and Madame Lerc with her two boys, each boy carrying in his hand a bouquet of flowers came to see the Master. They were served with tea in his own room and he gave them excellent advice about the education of the boys. Other persons called and all afternoon till 8 o'clock he was receiving people of different system of thoughts {{p8}} and creeds. At eight as he was invited to speak to the Theosophists, we went ahead and arrived with Mon Dreyfus. Their hall was not for near. There was a large crowd and when the Master entered, they arose from their seats. The President introduced the Beloved in glowing words. "Abdul Baha" he said in part in my estimation is the perfect embodiment of universal love. He is the real and ideal prophet of brotherhood and peace. He is a perfect divine examples for all of us to follow.

He has spoken to many Theosophical Societies both in America and Europe and we all love and revere him became he is at one and the same time so divine and so human. The Bab was the founder of this movement. In the beginning this Baha’i movement was meant to be a reformation of Islam; but with the appearance of Bahaullah it lost its particular aspects and in one bound it became the most universal movement since the dawn of Christian era, Bahaullah the Baha’is believe is the greatest manifestation of God in this age. I request to every word of our beloved divine quest. Listen to his words of wisdom and knowledge. Forget for an hour your own thoughts and ideas and let your minds be filled with his ideas of divine spirit. At the end he will not be translated, however its calm and heavenly effect will uplift our souls. Now it gives me the greatest pleasure to introduce to you Abdul Baha, the Servant of God." The Master's talk was on warrior aspects of divine philosophy so well woven together that one would think it was one string of brilliant pearls. It had come striking sentences. For example: "Where was adjourn when God was governing the world? 
After the meeting the President thanked the Master for his eloquent exposition of divine philosophy and the idea of cosmogony. Many stepped forward and shook hand with him.

{{p9}}

I forgot to state that the President of the Esperanto Society in Paris has offered to pay all the expenses of the publication of a Book in Persian. Esperanto, if same of the Persians would study it do well as be able to with such a best book. The Master is going to appoint one the Persians in Paris to do this.

Dear Harriet!

America is good! America is good. They have another motion, life and exultation. America - so far as the Bahai Cause is concerned - cannot be compared to England, neither England can be compared to France. Thus Our Beloved exclaimed this morning after reading to him the translation of the introduction of the President of the Theosophical Society. Our Master looks to America for a great spiritual movement, and it is now the duty of the friends to arise in the fulfilment of his anticipations. The seeds which he has sown needs much irrigation, tender care and solicitude. I hope everyone of the believers of God will make his utmost effort to spread the Cause. {{p2}} He slated the people of Paris were of two kinds. First, the followers of a dogmatic religion; second, the free-thinkers. The former follows blindly the priests; the latter does not like to hear the word of religion mentioned. However all these conditions will change. The power of the Word of God will influence the hearts to such an extent that not a trace of these thoughts shall remain. There have been atheists always but when the religion of God becomes manifest all these things are forgotten. Then he mentioned two historical events; one of the two of Haroun Er-Rashid and another of the children of Baha-ollah. I will share with you the latter. The Blessed Perfection {{p3}} was very young and at that time he was going to Majanderan. As he was travelling from stage to stage, he arrived at a town called "Yall-Roud". There was in this town a celebrated thinker who attracted to his course of lectures people from all parts of Persia thus he was made very famous. During the evening Baha-ollah called on him and found his room filled with many students and theologians, especially four of them were the followers of the school of Mirza Mohamad Take. As Baha-ollah was very young and he had not on his head the insignia of learning which "turban" no one gave any attention to him. The lecturer after {{p4}} awhile proposed a tradition to the audience to be interpreted. It was this: "Verily Fatima was the best woman in the world, except that woman which was born of Mary". Every one gave his own interpretation but the lecturer waved it aside. Then Baha-ollah to the amazement of all arose from his seat and asked permission to be allowed to give the interpretation of the tradition. Immediately all the eyes were turned to him in an incredulous manner. He said: The second sentence in this verse was an affirmative negation; because it says "except that woman which was born of Mary" and as we know to Mary was born no girl, therefore it was impossible to find another woman equal to {{p5}} Fatima; she was therefore peerless according to this tradition. When writers desire to say that such a person is better than all the rest of the world, they express their convictions with these literary expressions. For example we might say: This King is the greatest of all the Kings except that King which came down from heaven and as we know well, no King has ever come down from heaven, therefore he is unique and peerless. When the lecturer heard this wonderful explanation he remained silent and the audience realizing their defeat shifted uncomfortably.

Baha-ollah tactfully withdraw from the room {{p6}} then the lecturer addressed his students that he had greater hope in them; that he thought it was a disgrace to the learned class that a youth with the hat of a layman on his head should so eloquently explain the real significance of the tradition while the students after year of application were ignorant of it!

By this time people started to come and Mon and Madame Dreyfus led them one by one or two by two to His Presence.

It was long after twelve that the Beloved {{p7}} was free to come out and allay the thirst of all those who were patiently waiting. His talk was original and provoking of thought. It was on a subject that is of interest to everyone. "What is personality? What is individuality? And what is character?" He went on to explain that there are two Kinds of Personalities. The first Kind is inmate and that is the individuality; the second is acquired and that is the "personality" of man. Character is a combination of both. When the two attributes are well developed in man and where Individuality and Personality are in the highest state of society and progress, that man has character.

{{p8}}

After the address, he went out with Dr. Mohamad Khan and on his return he told us that he went to see the Lovare. Miss Fraser was here to say goodbye. She is leaving this afternoon for London. The Master told her to look always to Baha-ollah, not think of herself and ever serve the Cause. Later she is going to Edinburg with Miss Buckton to teach and spread the Cause.

About 4 o'clock many prominent Persians came to see the Beloved. Tea was served. He spoke to them on so many topics that I do not know where to start but I will tell you in brief.

{{p9}}

At one point he said that when he was very young he was travelling with Baha-ollah and his family. They reached the city of Kermanshalan. Here they took quarters in a Caravan serac. A poor boy came to assist them in unloading, carrying to them water etc. At night Abdul Baha gave him a full dish of Polow and meat and watched him eat. He was enjoying it very much. It was as though he had never eaten Polow. Abdul Baha conversed with him. Little by little he divulged to his childlike dream: "I never had eaten such royal dish in all my life and I fully believe (he sighed deeply) that if I could have such dinner for three successive nights I would become a King but you are going to leave tomorrow (anxiously). Are you not?" {{p10}} Another story which may be of interest to the physicians may be related. There was a man stricken with dysenteries. He had hemorrhoids. He got so sick that his bowels worked from 40 to 60 times and he lost qualities of blood. This man is now living in Acca. At the time the illness attacked him he sent for a well-known physician in Beirut. The Doctor charged 300 Sterling for 6 days to come to attend to him. He arrive on the scene and after two days attendance, he told the relatives of the patient that he may eat anything because he could not live more than two days. {{p11}} The relatives came to Abdul Baha weeping and in a state of utmost expectation saying that the Doctor told them that the patient was going to die in two days! "O Lord assist us"! They cried. The Master went to see the patient. He was indeed at the door of death. He prescribed a simple remedy. He said: "Go and get the skins of unripe sour pomegranates; brew them in a pot and let him drink the juice." They did so and he got much better. The doctor who was of course European and knew nothing about this natural treatment was astounded when he heard the patient was recovering. In an incredulous manner he entered the room of the sick {{p12}} and saw him sitting up in his head. "What did you do to get well?" By all calculation you must have been dead at this very time; he said in a mystified manner. "I took the juice of the unripe skin of sour pomegranates." The answer came distinctly from the patient. He was wonderstruck. He had never heard in his life of such a medicine and such an immediate recovery. In order not to loose any of his professional dignity he got up from his seat, took his hat in his hand and straightening himself said: "Such kind of treatment is not found in our Materia Medica! Allah protect you!"

{{p13}}

The Master talked on history, and of the experiences of one of the Persian Ambassadors in Constantinople who for many years tried to harm Baha-ollah but when he was himself in trouble he asked the advice of the Blessed Perfection. About half past eight the Master followed by all the Persians went to 15 Rue de Greuze to attend the weekly friday night meeting. Mon Dreyfus continued his reading from the Tablet of Baha-ollah to the "Son of the Wolf". There Mirza Ali Akbar chanted the identical passage from the original. Oh! he chanted very beautifully! Then {{p14}} Madame Richard spoke about the Cause. She was a polished and inspirational speaker full of fire and enthusiasm. Then the Master in his majestic simplicity came in and delivered an address on the proofs of the Manifestation of God. At the end, he delivered a spiritual invocation on Arabic which created a mystic and calm atmosphere in the room and people dispersed quietly. May I translate the prayer? Yes? "I beg of Thee! O my God! My Lord! My Hope! and my utmost Desire! Verily Thou Knowest my humility, my constriction, my poverty, my indigence, my agitation and longing. I call {{p15}} Thee with a heart overflowing with Thy love, a spirit stirred by the wafting of the Graces of Thy Oneness and a soul assured by Thy Commemoration and praise!

O Lord! O Lord! Verily these souls are attracted toward the Kingdom of Thy Holiness and these hearts are enkindled with the Fire of Thy Love and these spirits are soaring toward the appeal of Thy Mercy.

O Lord! O Lord! Illumine the eyes with the lights of the Sun of Reality! Suffer the ears to hear the Noise of the Kingdom of Abha under all circumstances. Make us firm in Thy Cause, submissive before the Throne of Thy Majesty {{p16}} acknowledging Thy Dominion, arising in Thy Service, and engaged in Thy adoration. Verily Thou art the Merciful! Thou art the Omnipotent, and Thou art the Reward and the Wise.

The International Psychic Gazeth will continue in its next month issue the impressions of Our Beloved's Hands with a reading by W.C. Child.

This is a wonderful heirloom for the future and I believe every Bahai should have a copy. Write about this to Mr Jos H. Hamen in Wash and let him the address of C.W. Child.

I also enclose the Conversation of the Master with Mr Tracy. It is very interesting.

Miss Knoblock handed me another German newspaper which you will find herein. I think the Master's trip to Sluttfort is postponed for about 2 weeks and our German friends may return in a day or two.

I haven't heard from you this week. I hope you are well. Remember me kindly to Louise and the rest of the friends.

With much Bahai love

Ahmad

Dear Harriet!

Every day brings to us a new benediction and blessing. When I think of all the glorious Graces that Our Beloved is showering upon those who come into His Holy Presence, I wonder why the whole world does not accept His life-giving and light imparting Teachings. To me He is the Perfect Spirit, who while sitting upon the Throne of Majesty and Humility is educating the children of man with unswerving fidelity and universal love. Who can measure the depth of the sea of his sympathy? Who can comprehend the infinitude {{p2}} of his Knowledge? Who is able to rise to the summit of his divine wisdom? How can the limited surround the unlimited? All that I have written and all that I may write to the end of my life are only the weak expressions of a poorly-limited mind to describe and interpret the actions and the daily minister actions of one who to all intent and purposes is the Alone and Peerless!

This day the Master is sending Mirza Ali Akbar to Luzanne, Switzerland to teach the Cause. We are sorry to lose him for his gentle manner and humility had won to him all the hearts. In my eyes he was the typical idealist of the East. His roseate visions of life and his indifference {{p3}} to all inconveniences were dear to the hearts of those who must live a weary, prosaic practical life. This morning the Master giving him his lost injunctions about his sajouru in Luzanne. He stated that the question of teaching the Cause was the most important affair. Regardless of all the other matters, we must spread the message of the Kingdom. This was the matter that bestows life and gives to man the impetus to win eternal happiness and prosperity. Look at him, he has left everything else and is travelling around the world, spreading the glad tidings of the Kingdom of Abha. In this day one must follow this faith because, it is confirmed {{p4}} we must win the good pleasure of the Lord of Mankind through humility and evanescent. He was sending him to teach and spread the message. God willing he shall be confirmed and assisted. Let him go out with the utmost courage and heroism. Let him not heed the oppositions of the negligent ones. Let him be occupied in conveying the message. Today nothing will benefit man in the world of existence except, except the promotion of the Cause of God!

Many years ago Aga Jamal went to Acca. Abdul Baha observed that he had some thoughts which were not a kin to his. He was harbouring in his mind certain imaginations. In a veiled way, Abdul Baha advised him {{p5}} and asked: How many people did he teach on his way from Teheran to Acca? He answered: None, he could not find any opportunity. Abdul Baha then said: Aga Jamal! This long trip of his was entirely fruitless; he has traversed through many cities and yet he did not teach one soul! It would have been much better for him if he did teach one single soul in his own town without travelling. While Abdul Baha was telling him these things he looked into his face and found that his words made no impressions on him. Therefore the importance of a Bahai was in his devotion to the Cause of God. By this time Mirza Ali Akbar was weeping and begging the Master's confirmations. {{p6}} Abdul Baha said that the confirmations of God are always with man. They are inseparable from him. If his thoughts are base and degraded, those confirmations remain idle and unused; but if his thoughts are lofty and pure, the confirmations will assist him to advance and rise upward.

The believers of Stuttgart with their fragrant flowers in their hands came in and immediately the Master summoned them to His Presence. He spoke a great deal on the future of the Cause in that country, praising their firmness and resolution and wishing them to return on Monday. {{p7}} Then he received other believers, encouraging those who are in sorrow and cheering those who are depressed. At noon he unveiled His face in the Congregation of the friends and gave an address on the beauty and usefulness of all the created things. Man must enjoy these things but not be absorbed in them. Severance means the lack of attachment he said. There are certain souls who are very unhappy, if they lose anything to which to which they are attached. We must be attached only to God. We must praise Him fo His Blessings. If we have plenty, we must be thankful; if we do not have anything we {{p8}} must not feel unhappy. We must attach our hearts to God and to those principles which will make possible for us to win life eternally. We must be attached to the Kingdom of God. Then in both worlds we shall obtain Everlasting Existence.

Today and tonight played the cook again and prepared Persian dishes. The Master did not go out and had his lunch early. In the afternoon we prepared numerous packages of newspaper containing Bahai articles to the Master to Orient and America. The Master called on Rasheed Pasha, the former governor of Syria. {{p9}} At seven o'clock our dear brother Mirza Ali Akbar with one of the Arab Bahais left for Luzanne. Several Persian students with their French Professors came to see the Beloved. He spoke to them about education and universal language. 

Dinner was served at 9:30 and the Beloved immediately retired. 

Love to all

Dear Harriet

These days are swiftly passing and once gone they shall never be recalled. How great and significant are these days! We have to thank God a hundred thousand times an hour for He has permitted us to live in such a glorious century in which the Sun of Reality has become manifest, the Divine Breeze is wafting, the rain of Grace is pouring down, the fragrance of the flowers of idealism is diffused, the negligent has become aware, the heedless mindful and the dead resusciated. How happy must you be, for you have seen with your eyes the Center of Covenant, you have served the Light of the {{p2}} world, you have beheld the Glory of God! This is the day of work! This is the day of deed! This is the day of service! I wish every one of us could become a living word of Baha-ollah, an embodied proof of the Cause, a demonstrable evidence of Truth! It is really a most wonderful privilege to be Known as a Bahai. We must be proud of the name and try to live up to the heavenly standard set by Our Beloved. Every word he utters must find an outward expression. He sets the example for all spiritual aspirations and practical problems. He is loving, he is charitable; he is sublime, he is cosmopolitan. His kindness and compassion include all creation! Let us encolute Him! 

{{p3}} 

This Sunday morning the Master got up early, ordered Sayad Assadollah to prepare the tea and I to go out and bring a newspaper. It was six o'clock when I was drinking tea in His Presence. Soon Aga Faraj came in. As he entered the room the Master's eyes twinkled and his voice was heard: Welcome Aga Faraj! I am well pleased with thee. During the trip of Mirza Ali Kuli Khan and his wife to Teheran thou didst served them most faithfully. In reality thou didst serve me. It is impossible to describe how much the Persian Bahais were kind and hospitable toward them.

Gazing out the window, as he stopped walking, he looked down and on the opposite side of street there was a butcher's shop with a display {{p4}} of butchered animals. He said: Really one's heart is extremely grieved at such barbarous displays. The sheep, the lambs, the hens, the pheasants, the birds etc hanged downward. Man is yet very savage.

He became silent, even walking. This time he was not looking down but up, contemplating I know not what, whether on the negligence of man on the mercifulness of God. But again he stopped suddenly before the window, his hands full of motion and animation, his eyes dancing like two stars as he said: How large is the Creation of God! How stupendous His machinery! How infinite His dominion! How majestic His divine system! How imperial His Holy Court! Were it possible to build a heavenly railway; were it possible to construct an aeroplane and establish communication between the various {{p5}} planets, many marvellous discoveries would have been achieved! Then the inhabitants of the earth could associate with the denizens of other spheres. They could learn from them many things. They could then realize the grandeur and infinity of the universe. They would see with their own eyes how stupendous and magnificent are these shining stars. They would behold the wonders of the Almighty treasured in His universal Creation!

From this lofty plane he brought us back to mundane affairs. He related the story of a judge of Acca, a priest of an Artodon sect and Mohamad Ali. The judge was the Master's friend and was accustomed to inject opium in his system. The Master made him give it up and his family were most thankful and pleased. The judge would say that, when the time of injection {{p6}} arrived and he did not get the opium he felt weak and impotent. He was a drunkard too and if he did not drink for a day or two, he would feel the longing for it in the same way as his longing for the injection of opium. He had a hard fight against these two habits but at last he gave them up. One day he came to Abdul Baha and said: Master! I have just found out that this Mohamad Ali is most inimical toward you and in a smooth way he does everything to turn the people against you. Today I was calling on the priest of the Artodon church and Mirza Mohamad Ali came in. For one hour he sat silent, with his head bent. Al last the priest asked "what is the matter with you?" "Oh! Nothing!" he answered. "No! you must have something on your mind. Tell us about it." "Really, your honor, it is very difficult for me to explain certain sad phases of my life!" his voice low and humble {{p7}} "Well tell us the cause of your worry" the priest demanded impatiently. "You know Abbas Effendi?" "Yes!" "You see, he has treated us so unjustly! When he took possession of all our properties we said it was all right; he was our elder brother; we did not complain. Then he said, come and serve me. I and my brothers said 'Very well, let us do it.' Then he said, 'come and do this or do that'. Every day he belittled our station before the eyes of the public and we suffered silently. But your honor, we have come to our last resort. We cannot suffer any longer; for he has come and asked that we must write on paper that he was the incarnation of Christ. He was not satisfied with verbal confession. He wanted it to be in writing. Can we dare to do this, your honor?

The judge told the Master that I knew then how insinuatingly, this man tried to discredit {{p8}} Abdul Baha. He invented any kind of lies to suit his purpose, to win sympathy and to poison the minds against the Master.

The Beloved changed again his mood and talked about the instability of wealth, relating the story of a Jobran Effendi who once in Syria was the wealthiest man but today his widow in Alexandria was in dire need. This man was so wealthy that his establishment was like unto a large hotel. Where he gave dinner, the waiters would go to each guest and ask what dish he liked and bring it to him.

The Master asked Aga Faraj and myself to go out with him. It was a very cold day, the wind was blowing but the sun was up. As we walked toward Eiffel Tower I read to him a letter. He asked Aga Faraj to talk about his business which was that of a baker. He owns ten large baker-shops in Teheran. He told the Master about {{p9}} the price of wheat, the market fluctuation, the misery of the poor when wheat could not be transported from the interior during the winter owing to snow and cold weather and the price of bread soared high, making it very difficult for the poor to live. He begged the Master to soften the hearts of the rich so that they may at such times arise to help their little brothers. "The poor always assist the poor but it was difficult for the rich to loose the string" he said. Once a man went to his neighbour, saying, "I have heard you have some bottles of wine, seven years old. Will you give me one of them?" The neighbour answered: No, if I wanted to give them away, they would not have lasted seven years."

The Master for one hour talked with him about wheat, barley, bread, the tricks the merchant of wheat use to cheat the poor {{p10}} farmers and Aga Faraj dilated to Him all the worries and difficulties of his profession. For the time being the Master had turned to be an expert baker and wheat-dealer. He made Aga Faraj feel perfectly at home. It was a wonderful Psychologist study. How the Master knows to speak with each person according to his capacity. This Aga Faraj is illiterate, cannot read or write but his faith, his services, his love for the Cause have made him one of the elect in the Kingdom of God. I have heard from others that during the hard winter months, he takes care of dozens Bahai and non-Bahai families in such a way that they do not even know from which source their daily sustenance is coming. It is a great privilege to meet this rugged, simple tall man. In business, he is a baker but in love and service he is a spiritual King.

{{p11}}

Which the Master was talking with Aga Faraj the verse of the bible came to my mind that man does not live by bread alone; "I am the bread which has come down from heaven." The idea was then suggested to me: "Is not the Master the heavenly Baker? Does he not bake the bread of life? Is not his oven always working?" Daily he bakes this bread to satisfy the spiritual hunger of mankind. You may have heavenly cornflake, spiritual shredded wheat, all kinds of divine biscuits and the latest of his invention may be said to be a kind of "moral triscuit".

On his return he met many visitors individually. Each person had only a few minutes; but they were most happy and glad because they could see one who was the source of all spirituality and holiness in this material world.

{{p12}}

Our Beloved's talk was an extensive exposition of the power of reason, its utilization in the artistic and scientific world and its adaptation to the need of time. As there were many Persian students he spoke on the mind and intellect and that religion must correspond with these two verities.

After the talk he went out with Mon. Dreyfus. A famous photographer had requested him to take his colored, natural photograph. This will be again another addition to the rich treasures which will be handled down to posterity. On his return we all sat around the divine table. Later Rasheed Pasha came to see him. The subject of conversation was the wiping away of superstitious and misunderstandings from amongst the religions and nations.

Right after him a colored man speaking the French language came to pay his homage. {{p13}} The Master said: The race problem in America is very intense. Its non-solution will end in danger and war. The colored people in the United States have advanced much intellectually. They have many schools, colleges, universities and churches. They invited him to Howard University. There were many hundreds of colored students but a few of white people could be seen here and there. In the second meeting, there were more white, in the third meeting white and colored associating with each other! -this made him very happy. He advised both races and they became very friendly. He gave them many illustrations of variety and unity from the mineral, vegetable and animal Kingdoms. There was a colored pugilist, Jack Johnson who defeated in an athletic fight a white man. This created much resentment against the colored race. In reality we are {{p14}} all the servants of God. We are all his children, whether white or black. These color lines are mere superstitions. They are the phantasmal shadows of a prejudiced mind. They have no foundation. In short he spoke much with them and he hopes his utterances will bear much fruits.

At four o'clock, he called on the wife of Mr. Sacy to take tea with her and see again her children.

At eight o'clock the most important meeting that has been held since our arrival in Paris was held in the theological college of Pastor Monnier. There were in the audience many professors, pastors and students of theology. The meeting was devoted to questions and answers on metaphysics, Christian Theology, philosophy and religion. It was marvellous, nay rather miraculous to see the {{p15}} Master answering these intricate questions with such readiness and power! They were all not only silenced but they were glad to sit at his feet and learn. As Pastor Monnier said at the opening of his brief introduction: "We are pleased to hail amongst us a man from God bringing to us a message on the part of God." Just think a moment! This was said by a Pastor, the President of a Theological College before a large number of Professors, ministers of the Gospel and young men who are being educated for the Ministry! The questions and answers were all written down and were long I will translate them. It was a remarkable document necessary for every Bahai teachers.

Dear Harriet!

The Light of Reality is shining upon all the regions! Happy are those who are illumined! The fragrance of the Rose-garden of Abha is diffused, blessed are those who are perfumed. The Banquet of the Lord of Hosts is spread, joyful are those who partake there from. The King of the spiritual Love has appeared, glad are those who are favoured in His divine Court. The angel of life hath sounded the trumpet, wakeful are those who answer the Call. The herald of Peace and reconciliation hath raised His Voice, blissful are those who have hearkened. The River of the Bounties of God is flowing, satisfied are those who drink from this salubrious water. The torch of guidance is lighted, enlightened are those {{p2}} who follow the light. Divine civilization has upraised its pavilion, privileged are those who have sheltered themselves beneath it. The clarion of the heavenly religion is sounded, glory be unto those who have listened!

Abdul Baha is the source from whom the divine attributes become manifest and he is working day and night so that the people may consciously realize in what a glorious day they are living and avail themselves of these rare opportunities! How great must be the blessing of Europe and America in thus receiving these heavenly teachings while the Bahais in Persia will give up their lives if they could simply look for one moment in his shining Countenance. I wonder whether we can ever comprehend the deep significance of His luminous Presence, the unlimited downpour of His Mercy, the greatness of His life and the mystery of his humanity.

{{p3}}

This morning he spoke of the stability of the Bahai Movement based upon reality and have many other movements disappear in the welter of chaos and disorder. All those people who work for the furtherance of their own interests will pass away. They are like the foams on the crest of the waves. But the apostles who were lost in Christ, they exist. Only the sincere souls shall become confirmed. He related the story of Haji Karim Khan who was one of the wisest men of Persia but no sooner he wrote a book against the Bahai movement he became as naught. It was said that as a student he hardly slept for three years; that he studied all nights and only slept for an hour or two before sunrise. He had a most remarkable memory; and could recite the Koran and many books on poetry and philosophy.

At ten o'clock several new souls arrived but as the Beloved {{p4}} was out they had to wait. He came in late and delivered a most beautiful and touching address on kindness and compassion, saying now is the beginning of the dawn of light in the West. It is his hope that it will attain to the utmost brilliancy. May they be so educated as to adore the oneness of the world of humanity! May they be kind to all the religions and nations of the world! May the utmost desire of their hearts be the guidance of humankind. May they be the cause of progress to all the people! May they unfurl the waving flag of the Love of God! May their Voices of Peace reach the Kingdom of Abha! May their cries and clamour of brotherhood ascend to the supreme concourse! May each one of them become a brilliant torch, shedding lights upon all the countries of the world! After the meeting he called me {{p5}} and as I walked behind him toward the Eiffel Tower he spoke of many things, the record of which is out of the Keeping of this communication. We walked so for that we had to hire a taxi to return for lunch.

At four o'clock he attended a meeting at the apartment of an American lady Mrs. Lilian Haydon Hieston, 170 Boulevard du Montparnasse. She is a Bahai and only 3 weeks ago she arrived from America. As almost all those who were present were Americans I translated the Master's talk. He spoke on capacity and receptivity; that we must increase our ability, we must become hungry, thirsty in order to enjoy food and water. Mrs Hieston was of course very happy to have the Master bless her apart and all those who were present were delighted with the Teachings.

{{p6}}

From there the Master attended Mr. Scott's meeting. The studio was crowded. His subject was on the equality of man and woman citing the example of some Persian women who were firm and steadfast under several trials and ordeals. Toward the close of his address he said: whenever he heard that such women were found he will be made very happy, he stopped and begin to shake hands, circulating amongst the audience, smiling here, nodding approvingly there but continuing his talk. This is the work. All else save this has no result. Humanity must become illumined with the light of the Kingdom, otherwise all our efforts will remain fruitless. Mon spends his time in the pursuit of shadowing objects. When he leave this world {{p7}} then no relatives, no family, no friends will benefit him. He will leave them all behind. His wealth, his possession, his dominion and even his Lover, dignity will not satisfy him. Nay rather all these things will be the cause of his remorse and regret, for he sees that he must leave them and go away empty-handed. But if he possesses merciful susceptibilities, and if he is quickened with the divine spirit and if he realizes that he has attained to the eternal life then these things will confer upon him a happiness which shall last throughout eternity. Thus the Master finished his address. On our return he called me to his room and spoke about success and confirmation which may be of great interest to you. As soon as I {{p8}} left the room I wrote down his conversation; as much of it as I could remember. Herein is a translation from my own notebook: At nine o'clock Our Beloved called me into his private room and bade me be seated. He asked me about Madame Dreyfus' talk at Mr. Scott. I gave Him an outline of it. Then he asked: Tell me, what God is doing? How did I know what god is doing? Half of the time I didn't know what myself was doing; how much less i know about God's business. He did not consult with anybody. I was confused. I did not know what to answer. I was silent. The Master as though enjoying my confusion went on repeating the question: "Tell me! What is God doing just as this time? " Goodness me! That was more difficult! Well, I had to say something so I said: "God is confirming us to succeed." "Bravo! well said." But I have certain things that attract the confirmations of God and achieve success. They {{p9}} are so wonderful and extraordinary that if I tell them, some people may not accept them as facts. These things especially belong to me. No one else knows or has ever given any importance to Him. For example: Whenever in the beginning of the lunar month I happen to look at the crescent of the moon, I raise my two hands with their palms open toward the heaven and repeat nine times. "Ya Baha El Abha". During all the days of that month, the heavenly Confirmations are experienced and success is witnessed. Again whenever at midnight, I am awakened I repeat the saying: "Verily God is the Deliverer" many, many times, as many times as I feel the need of it, then right next day a great confirmation and success are seen and experienced. Again, I never enter any meeting or assembly to speak without first turning my face to the Blessed Perfection; that is why they prove to be effective! These are my mysteries of the Kingdom of success. Many people have done these things {{p10}} but they have witnessed no confirmation nor success.

Strangest of all is the following. When I made the necessary preparations to build the Tomb of the Bab on Mount Carmel, there was a piece of land belonging to a Foreign Consul, the acquisition of which was essential to the building. This land would have opened a direct path from the foot of the mountain to the Holy Tomb. When the Nakajezeen found out that I expected to buy this land, they went to the owner and filled his ears with wild stories of gold and silver. They told him that Abbas Effendi was obliged to buy this land from him, therefore he may raise the price {{p11}} and ask him any amount he liked. When I began to speak with the owner of the land about the price, he said 5 franes a yard. I said: All right, I accept without any murmur; go and prepare the papers! Several days passed and I did not see him. When I saw him, I remarked why don't you end this transaction? He said: Oh this land there are many vines, If you can pay fifteen franes for each vine I will sell it. "All right" I yielded again and he disappeared for two more weeks. "Why do you protract this small affair? " I questioned when I met him for the third time. "Oh!" he said, "As soon as you buy this land you must put {{p12}} wires on both sides." I answered: "For your sake I will build two high walls." "Very well, then I am satisfied with this arrangement." He went away and I did not see him for nearly a month. When I saw him for the fourth time I asked the reason for this unnecessary delay. "Really" he rejoined "As I am the Consul of a foreign power, I cannot go to the government land office to register this transference. If you like to buy this land you have to buy it without government registration. "All right" I said. At last, after much discussion it was arranged that we may meet each other on a certain day in a house and transact this {{p13}} affair. On the hour I was there and the brother of Sadek Pasha, one of the Grand Vizers of the Ottoman Empire was with me. We waited and waited and he did not show himself. At last the brother of the Grand Vizer took his umbrella and in a downpour of rain went to the house of the Consul to find out what has become of him. They told him he is not at home. He returned, wasted another hour and went again to see the Consul. He did not come out of his own room but sent word that he is not in. On his second return his clothes were so full of mud that one could not see anything else. {{p14}} He walked in wrath and anger. He threw down the umbrella and furiously exclaimed: Master! it is no use. Give up buying this land. The man is hidden in his own house and does not want to see us. I have never called on anybody in this fashion but this man is so egoistically arrogant. You can conceive how I felt that after six months of worry, waiting and expectation this was now the outcome. I felt most grieved and perturbed. I returned home but did not speak with anyone. I went straight to my room and locked the door so that no one may disturb me. Several times they knocked at the door announcing tea and supper

{{p17}}

of the land was lawfully transferred to me. Then I said to another man: I will buy your land too. He said: No! You have what you need. You do not need any more. You want to buy this second piece of land so as not to hurt my feeling, but we are glad just the same. I insisted much to get that piece of land too, but the German Consul would not think of it. The morning of the next day I started the construction of the road, because the materials were made ready a long time ago.

Love to all the friend of God

Dear Harriet!

Today Our Beloved spoke on the efficacy of the Holy Spirit. Man cannot attain to the highest summit of human progress without the assistance of the Breathes of the Holy-Spirit. A man intellectually may become enabled to educate a few, but general education is imparted to the world of humanity through the prophets of God, because they are the real Instructors of the human race. The foundation of civilization is the amelioration of the conditions of morality; the basis of spirituality is the purity of morality. The Everlasting Glory of the world of humanity is in the readjustment of morality. The power and the potency of man is through the refinement of morality. And the beautification {{p2}} of morality is impossible except through the Breathes of the Holy Spirit. Therefore whosoever is confirmed with the Breathes of the Holy Spirit, will be assisted to confer a general education. This is the difference between the influence of religion and philosophy.

In the morning Our Beloved sent several mailgrams to the friends in the Orient telling them the news of the Cause, because nowadays he could write Tablets. He was too busy. After drinking tea in His Presence he came suddenly toward me and laughingly slapped four times on my cheeks. He said: Ah! lately I have not been giving you your salary! He struck with such force that for several hours afterwards I could "feel" the taste of it. I always feel much better after receiving one of his love pats; but it so happened today that I received another one before the eyes of all the {{p2}} friends. Of course they were very much amused and laughed. It was right after his public address. He was going around shaking hands with each one but as he passed by me, instead of shaking hand I received a nice hard blow. I assure you, it was a good one; one long to be remembered. Then a lady came to me and asked mischievously why did you not show your left cheek? I told her that my both cheeks were at the disposal of the Lord. He doeth whatsoever He willeth.

At nine o'clock a very prominent Persian came and had an interview with our Beloved. He spoke with him about his imprisonment and the many frustrated machinations of Sultan Abdul Harriet Keram against his life. The upshot of all was that He was now in Paris, teaching the principles of the Bahai Cause and Abdul Wanid {{p4}} was surrounded with gloom and degradation.

Four young Persians arrived. They were the graduates of the school of Tarbiat and had passed government examination two years ago. And they are now being educated at the expense of the government in the Parisian schools. One of these four students was Mirza Ashraf, the brother of Ihodsea Khanom, the Persian girl who is now studying in Washington. He was a very fine young man, very dignified and refined in manner. The Master told them in part: He hoped that they will study well, that they will acquire those sciences which will be useful to Persia on their return. He wished them to fit themselves to be the living pioneers of modern arts and sciences in Persia. The Persians in the past few ages have been {{p5}} only destroying, setting back that glorious nation in the seal of civilization, but Abdul Baha hoped the students' well build, that they will lay the solid foundation of true enlightenment. They were the young plants of the garden of hope. Let them strive so that they may grow and develop and adorn the trees of their lives with delicious fruits.

{{p6}}

At six o'clock the students desired to leave for their school so the Master called them to His Presence and said: He was made very happy to meet them. He hoped the trees of their existences may bring many fruits. Some of the young Persians who came to Paris learn only the vices of civilization. Now they must show them otherwise. May they study in such wise as to confer life upon Persia. May they be conducive to the promotion of the Cause of God! May they ameliorate the moral conditions of the nation! May they promote sanctity and holiness amongst the people! May they give impetus to progress, to agriculture, to commerce and arts.

About seven o'clock he took me for a short walk. A mother with the utmost of tenderness was carrying a child in her arms. He looked {{p7}} at the child and said: Children give a person the greatest consolation. No matter how much the father is sad or cross, as soon as his darling child laughs or speaks, he is made happy. One who has had children has gone through a joyous experience that is impossible to describe in word! It is an indescribable state, a divine condition full of sweetness and love. He had a son almost 3 or 4 years old. This child was a great comfort to him. Often past midnight while he was sound asleep, the child would leave his small bed and slowly creep in toward his putting his dimpled little arms around his neck, kiss his closed eyelids and face. Then Abdul Baha would wake up and endear and caress it. That state - that happiness - that beatific joy, to wake up and find your beloved child clasping his tiny arms around your neck that is only known to a father.

Love to all

###Concerning the state of spirituality between the Master and Mrs. Henlay

Mrs Henlay - You sent word to me through Isabel Fraser that you desired for me a high state of spirituality. Will you please explain to me just what is meant by that and how one can attain unto it?

The Master - By attaching no importance to material things. According to the laws which bind us to this planet, everyone is tied to the gratification of self, to the satisfying of desires. What I meant for you is that you may be freed - that you may become the embodiment of spirit - that you may become an angel.

Mrs Henlay - But for me detachment is difficult. I desire to make for myself a name in the theatrical world. How can one attain to the state in the theatrical world?

The Master - Even the theatrical world would not prevent you from becoming what I desire you to become. You can engage in work of an uplifting kind - the kind that will tend to lift one out of the sense world into the world of art, not the kind that is degrading. Strive for that which prompts you to the personification of dignity and art. The theatrical world need not prevent your development.

{{p9}}

Mrs Henlay - How can I attain to greater stability? I feel terribly depressed and discouraged at times?

The Master - Whenever you feel depressed, go alone into the secret chamber, read one of the Hidden Words and with the utmost supplication beg of Baha-ollah to impart you that happiness which is essential for the future. Pray with great humbleness: "O God! Free me from these fetters. Release me from all these toils. Make me pure and sanctified. Illumine me. Fill my heart with thy love and attach me to Thyself - so that I may become a captive to your love. My I not seek ought but thee! May I not search but for Thy Love, and may I walk always in thy path!

Then you will attain to a glorious state - then you will obtain a condition which you would not exchange for the whole world.

Mrs Henlay - My great desire is to have more faith.

The Master - This very prayer will bring you the pearl of great price.

Dear Harriet!

It is now nearly one month that Our Beloved has been in Paris. Day and night He has been teaching, dispensing practical goodness, spreading the light of Knowledge, illumining the hearts with the Fire of the Love of God, heralding at the top of His Voice that dawn of the Kingdom and the virtues of the world of humanity, diffusing the Fragrances of the garden of Reality, scattering seeds in the new lands and irrigating the fresh plants. From unexpected quarters come the news of awakening and interests. The circle of the Cause is constantly being widened, more and more people are hiding the dawn of the New Day; the birth of the New Hope and the majestic rising of the New Sun! Eagerly they look forward to the hour when the Pavilion of Peace {{p2}} prepared by Baha-ollah is pitched in the center of the world. What is Abdul Baha doing in Paris? How does He spent His hours? What are the thoughts that are uppermost in His mind? He is rendering the same services to the world of humanity that the prophets of Yore did. What was the works of those prophets? you ask. I may just as well answer it in the words of Abdul Baha given in his today's address: The prophets of God are the real Instructors and Educators, so that the morality of the people is improved; the ignorant become wise, the blind receive sight, the deaf become hearing, the mute unstop their tongues, the pusillanimous become magnanimous, the earthly birds transformed into heavenly nightingales, the animalistic souls become divine, the imperfect attain to perfection and those who are captives of nature, released from its fetters. {{p3}} Therefore we must strive day and night so that these trees of the temples of humanity become fruitful, the extinct lamps be ignited, the thorny desert, a rose garden, the wild jungle, an orchard, the dark world illumined, the infernal terrors changed to divine splendors and the satanic reality to the merciful reality. This was Abdul Baha's hope and if was not this the hope of all the god-ordained messengers?

{{p4}}


Later while walking, he related a humorous story about a Bahai whose name was Mirza Javad. He was a very learned and literary personage but he had queer and fantastic habits, besides having a temper that even the angels could not endure him. While the Bahais lived in Bagdad, this Mirza Javad was living with them. He had a melancholic and disconsolate disposition, he got angry very quietly. It {{p5}} was impossible for any man to associate with him for one day without having a quarrel. His disposition was most better and his temper something terrific. With him Abdul Baha associated very advisably for eight years. Notwithstanding his Knowledge he had many strange superstitions. For example he firmly believed that when he grew very old he will suddenly be rejuvenated and become youthful as handsome as "Joseph". He also believed because the Bab had divided the year into 19 months, in the future something will happen to the moon that instead of rising and setting 28 days in the month, it will rise and set only 19 times. When he became angry, he would be attacked with such facial contortions that were positively ludicrous. For instance his beard would get crooked, his moustaches, one {{p6}} would go up, the other down and his eyes bloodshot. Once he came home very angry roundly cursing himself. He was shaken by such white rage that for a long time he could not find the keyhole to open the door. Abdul Baha went to his help and asked him what was the matter? He was so furious that he could not answer. At last he gave Abdul Baha the cause of his anger. It was about someone whom he thought had insulted him six months ago, but he remembered it now. {{p7}} The friends always tried to argue with and refute him. But when he came to Abdul Baha with his theories of moon and rejuvenation he would smile and say: Very good! Very good! God willing you will renew your life!


The Master told us another story in which Baha-ollah appeared as a judge. It so happened that {{p8}} while in Bagdad, during the season that the pilgrims arrived from all over the Islamic world to visit the Holy Shrines of the Mohamadans, Baha-o-llah entered a neighboring city, called Samereh. Samereh was much frequented by the pilgrims of various nationalities and the Arabs landlords charge exultant prices for their rooms. One of these landlords who knew Baha-o-llah, rented a room to a Persian nobleman for two weeks at the Nice of 30 dollars. This Persian roomer would call the Arab every morning to drink tea with him and he would have him always at dinner and supper; for he cooked various Persian dishes, rice, chicken etc. After two weeks, the Persian gave him the rent but the Arab asked for more, and in as much as he could speak out a few Persian words, he was unable to make himself understood; therefore he went to Baha-o-llah and pleaded {{p9}} for justice, saying that during two weeks this man gave him a whole lot of trouble. Every morning, every morning he would ask him to drink tea, to eat chicken at noon and Pilaw at night! And now he has given him only thirty dollars! Baha-ollah laughed heartily and the Master did not tell us in what way he smoothed the ruffled feelings of the Arab.

In the morning according to the wish of the Beloved, we called on Moayar-El-Mamalek. He was quite sick, and was deeply touched by the tenderness and love of the Master. On our return we found the Persian Ambassador had a private interview with Abdul Baha. The rooms were filled with French, Americans, Persians, Indians and other nationalities all patiently waiting. At noon he came out and everybody arose as a sign of respect. His address was {{p10}} on the important subject of religion and philosophy, the difference and the points of contrast between them.

After the meeting he went out with Doctor Mohamad than to call on Gaemmagam but he was not in his hotel, returned tired from walking, Sayad Assadullal was ordered to prepare the Samavar. About 3:30 Gaemmagam, the son of Sheik-or-Rais and Entezam-es-Saltaneh entered into His Presence. They complained of the cold of the last three days. The Master replied, this largely depends upon habit. For instances, the face which is a delicate part of the body and the eyes still most delicate, they seldom catch cold because they are always exposed but as we cover our feet or our breasts, as soon as they are exposed to weather we suffer the result. In Africa and Arabia there are many tribes who are naked all their lives and do not know what "catching cold" means; because from childhood, they are not wrapped in swaddling clothes.

He gave an outline of educational system as established by Lycurgus the King of Sparta. Lycurgus was well versed in law and he wished to treat his subjects justly. As he looked over the Spartans, he observed that they were divided into three classes. 1st, farmers and labourers. 2nd, artisans and merchants. 3rd, the ruling class. {{p12}} The ruling class was in great minority. He wished to keep the ruling class in power, so that if they were not in the majority numerically, they may be intellectually and physically superior to the other two classes. This plan he desired to promote with a fair amount of justice towards the rest of the population; so he drafted the following regulations for the intercourse and education of the nobles. Of paramount importance, he considered the problem of marriage. Whenever a young man and a girl desired to marry, both of them were examined thoroughly by the physician. If they were without any ills he would issue a certificate of marriage, otherwise the couple could not marry. This law was rigorously kept in force. When a woman was conceived, she had to work harder {{p13}} than ever. Certain definite exercises were prescribed according to the spirit of the time - such as walking, carrying heavy loads, athletics - so that the child may become accustomed to movement and hardened in the matrix of mother. As soon as the child saw the light of day, they would wash it in a tub of cold water. If the milk of the mother was not good, they would either feed the child with the milk of a nurse or the animals. Often they would expose its body to the wind and cold and let it sleep outside. Seldom the children were kept in the houses. They were always in the open, in the bracing air, either with their nurses or mothers. When the child was three years old, they would wake him, walk a great deal. The first eight years of the child's life were devoted to walking, swimming, mountain climbing, athletics of all kinds, living in camps and {{p14}} forests and eating good wholesome food - thus welding slowly and naturally a perfect physical form ensured to hardships, likewise the brain become kin and alert for mental study. From the age of 8th to twelve, half of the day was spent in the study of the elements of education - reading, writing, music and the other half, the teachers took the boys into the field, and kept them busy playing ball, polo, wrestling, running and many kinds of sports invented for this period of life. From the age of twelve to twenty, they again studied half of the day - reading literature, history, mathematics, geometry, politics - in fact all the sciences which were in vogue at that age and the other half, they passed in learning how to swim, how to fence, how to use the instruments of war. {{p15}} At the age of twenty they were graduated from the school. Physically they were perfect specimen of manhood, strong athletics, alert, intellectually brilliant, wide-awake, full if vigor and vivacity. They could walk 30 miles without fatigue and they could be a statesman or quote poetry or speak on philosophy etc. If they did not sleep 48 hours they were yet wide-awake.

{{p17}}

The Master told another story to illustrate how physical stamina was necessary to be developed from childhood in connection with scientific studies. For one without the other will not make a perfect man or woman: Once upon a time he was invited to a garden-party outside of the Fortress of Acca. There were about seventy guest including the governor, the judges, officials, and members of the government. They stayed in the garden all day talking and carrying social intercourse amongst with those who were present. Toward the afternoon Abdul Baha bade {{p8}} them farewell and started to walk to Acca. On his way, there was a deep stream with strong current. As he was passing he heard the cry of a man for help and when he looked around he saw a camel in the stream trying to save himself and the owner was standing by helpless. Studying the situation Abdul Baha returned to the garden and called on the officials to come and pull the camel out of the stream. They brought a cord and tied the feet, the tail and the neck of the camel but they could not pull him out. They did not have physical force enough to do it. They have to give up their effort but lo and behold Abdul Baha saw in the distance three Arab villagers. He asked them to save the Camel and in no time the poor camel was out of the hole. This shows how seventy people who were to all outward {{p19}} appearances educated could not cope with the force and influence of the three farmers; but Lycurgus system simultaneously developed the body and the mind.

Dear Harriet!

If a person is honest and not barned, he is much better than a learned man but dishonest. If one is truthful but ignorant, he is preferred to an educated soul who is a liar. If a man is loyal but illiterate he is superior to man who may be a philosopher but dis-loyal.The sublimity of one's nature comes through moral refinement and not the acquisition of sciences. An ignorant thief may steal a few dollars but a clever scientific burglar may rob a whole house. Science does not make man better. If only puts in his hands certain instruments whereby he may use them either for destruction or construction. The laws of the moral world teaches man to use these implements always for the betterment of humanity but we are not certain about the laws of science. They lead him sometimes along pleasant pastures and cooling streams and again they may prompt him to walk towards yawning chasms, or dizzy heights, dangerous precipices or cavernous depths. The Holy Divine Manifestations are sent to this world to save man from these catastrophes. They are the real Guides of the World of humanity. They are the polestars towards which the mariner directs his ship. They are the suns of reality flooding all the regions with their glorious lights. They are the salubrious fountains which alloy the unquenching thirst of the people. They are the Roses of the Garden of Abha which perfume the nostrils of the seekers. They are the direct Pathways towards the goal of divine virtues. They are the heavenly musicians playing the jeweled lyre of spiritual Love and singing the heart-captivating songs of the Kingdom of Beauty and the Art of life. They are the oceans of celestial thoughts and inspiring ideals, the waves of which rise to the sun-kissed door of heaven, setting motion and exhilaration through the spheres of the minds and the empires of the heart. We are now living in a day which these things are made possible of attainment. We must set the birds of the minds free, we must give liberty to the nightingales of the hearts. Let them ever soar heavenward in this blue immensity, wandering at the infinite creation of God till they reach to the Delectable rose-garden of Abha where the flowers never fade, the climate is most temperate, and the seasons representing only one season of fresh spring. Here the birds and nightingales shall perch upon the branches of the flowers; they shall sip the sweet nectar of the roses, the refreshing perfume of the hyacinths and the fragrance of the anemones. Here they will be transformed into the birds of Paradise. Here they will learn the secret of the Love of God. Here they will be instructed in the mysteries of the Kingdom of Abha! Here they will be taught those divine strains and beatific harmonies which are not of this world. Here they will study the knowledge of God. They will become angels of heaven, spiritualized beings and world-influencing souls. Then these birds and nightingales which are our ideas and ideals, after such deep, divine experiences will be able to sing any song which may stir the hearts; they will soar to any height which may become an example to others. I hope all of us may become worthy servants of the Threshold of Abha and arise to spread the message of the Kingdom.

This morning we drink tea in the Presence of Our Beloved. In his personal remarks, he was sad and melancholy. A tone of regret runs through every phrase he uttered. How dead to all spiritual emotions are the people of Paris! He regretfully said, "The inhabitants of this city are engrossed in the whirlpool of pleasure and self-gratification." When he looked upon Paris it seemed to him it was like unto a corpse on which creep thousands of worms climb up and down through the dead putrid corpse sucking its blood and pleased with its flesh. They do nothing else.

Again he said, as last night he did not eat and he could not sleep, so he got up and wrote some urgent letters till 5 o'clock. Then he went to bed before sunrise. The sleep before sunrise serves always as a tonic and it is most refreshing. Sleep is the food of body. Man does not rest through eating and drinking but through sleeping. Consider well! What importance lies in a life, the rest of which is enjoyed through sleep. Is not sleep similar to death? Therefore a life the rest of which is in death has no importance!

{{p3}}

Addressing me, He said, "The greatness of the American journey is not now known. Ere long its glories shall fill all the books and pamphlets of the world. There will be no other mention except this, Do you see this French Republique with all its wealth and position? Its duration is limited but the efficacy and significance of that trip are unlimited. You must appreciate adequately the value of these divine Bestowals. For example thou cannot comprehend fully at present the significance and freshness of thy trip to Nile and thy mission there. In the future it will become evident. If thou couldn't measure the height and depth of the marvelous events which have transpired and are transpiring in the Cause thou wouldst write down every word I utter with the pen of diamond upon the page of gold.

{{p4}}

The master gave me a pot of lily of the valley to carry to Nostrat-od-Doulet, one of the princess of Persia who has been sick but is now better. On my return, the people had gathered in the large parlor and one by one they were ushered into the Presence of Our Beloved and coming out radiant and peaceful. His talk was on the subject of Paris and the Cause of God. He likened the world into a man. Man's life causes through the spirit. Likewise the life of this world which was only the larger man cause through divine and humane virtues. Toward the end of his address, He portrayed some graphic pictures. You see him now walking and again closing his eyes, now standing before this or that window and with one sweep of hand illustrating his point, anon taking off his turban and placing it up to the edge of his eyebrow, now peering out through his lashes; again smiling, now raising his two hands with its palms open to the sky, and speaking with command and authority and again a pleading gentleness and the music of heaven in his voice.

{{p5}}

May I quote for you a few striking points of today's address? Yes? Very Well:-

"Now Europe in reality is in the utmost beauty and adornment. Material civilization has advanced greatly.It is a body in the utmost of comeliness, but regrettable it is not animated by the Spirit. How pitiful that it has not the heavenly illumination! How sad that it does not enjoy the Breathes of the Holy Spirit! It is a mirror in the utmost of transparency but a thousand times alas! that the rays of the Sun of Reality are not reflected thereon! It is a tree most verdant and elegant but alas! it produces no fruits. Come! Will you? Come ye together! Concentrate your spiritual forces! Arise with much fervor and enthusiasm! Show ye a united a united effort! Let a new attraction take possession of your hearts! Let a new spirit sweep over your temples, so that the Fire of the Love of God which is enkindle in your holy of holies may flame forth setting a spiritual conflagration to the whole of Europe. You must not rest day and night until you have breathed in this body a new spirit and ignited a light in this lamp."

{{p6}}

After the talk everyone felt the silent, spiritual vibrations which were set at work this morning for the regeneration of Europe! It was the Command of God and it will ere long, find fitting instruments to carry out these great behests. He called me to accompany him. He did not speak and I was yet under the charm of his morning talk. I was walking behind him but as a somnambulist who walks in sleep. In front of the Eiffel Tower he sat on a chair commanding me to sit near him. I could not see him this morning for in my eyes he was transfigured into white lights of the Kingdom. He was the Glorified Humanity from who issued forth streams of iridescent rays to illumine the hearts of not only those who live in this day but the hearts of generations yet unborn.

{{p7}}

On our return, we all sat around his divine table and partook of the material food. Madame D'Astre came to see him and speak about tomorrow's meetings before L Alliance Spiritualiste. It is mainly through her effort that this meeting has come into being. Later more Dreyfus arrived and the Master went out with him. The Persians were invited to tea at the apartment of Mr. and Miss George, the latter, the pointer of the allegorical paintings of which I wrote previously. On our return, we did not find the Master but he arrived after a few moments. Doctor Mohamad Khan who has studied Espranto and translated into Persian verse the Poem of Prof. Famauhoff called "Espero" read it to the Master. He has also translated the letter of Prof. Famauhoff in which requires his reasons why a universal language was necessary and how he came to invent Esperanto.

{{p8}}

Madame Scaramuchi and a French lady come to see the Master. He said in answer to their guests The Cause of Baha-Allah is the source as the Cause of Christ. For example this room is now lighted, but someone comes in and turns off the light through his ignorance, and we are steeped in darkness. Then another person coming in and hearing voices and <unreadable> light and the room is again illumined. He may renew source of the furniture but the light and the room are always the same.

Love to all

Dear Harriet!

Pride and haughtiness are the worst qualities. If a person becomes the possessor of the whole world he must not become proud. Humility is the most shining star in the crown of man. In as much as we are all created from the same substance, why should we prefer ourselves above others? We are all humans. We are all the children of one Father; the sheep of one Shepherd; the members of one family; the birds of one orchard, the flowers of one rose-garden, the waves of one sea, the rays of one Sun; the stars of one heaven and the servants of One God. Let us all be humble before the signs of God and treat each other as brothers.

{{p2}}

This morning as I was entering the room of the Beloved heard his clean and animated voice, speaking to someone. In order not to break on the conversation. I stopped and heard the above admonition. Then I presented myself and was permitted to sit. After drinking tea he started out and summoned me to go with him and ask as guide to the apartment of Nostrad-Ed-Doubt. This young Prince is the son of Farman-Farma- the uncle of Nasernddin-Shah and his mother is the daughter of Mazaffar-Ed-Din Shah. He loves the Master and he was one of those who first called on him after his arrival. He has studied English and French and speak both languages well.

{{p3}}

When the Master entered the apartment, the young Prince was so overjoyed that he did not Know what to do and how to express privilege and happiness which had come to him. He could not realized what he had done to merit such a heavenly Favor, and as it were only a few days that he had been out of the hospital after a rather difficult operation, he could not call on the Master. Otherwise he would have where with us daily. Our Beloved was very Kind to him, inquired about his health and then the discussion became general about the condition of Persia and Turkey; the unfortunate reverses that these two Islamic nations have had during the last two generations, awing to the back of public spirited servants and maladministration of the governmental affairs. The Master related a story to {{p4}} illustrate his point stating that Mirza Take Khan was the ablest and most astute stateman that Persia had produced for a long time. Although he committed the greatest mistake of his life when he ordered the martyrdom of the Bab and the Bahais yet as we always remember the ability of even our worst enemy and never overlook justice, therefore we acknowledge the public services of this patriotic man. After the martyrdom of the Bab he himself confessed that he had two errors in his public career. One was the death of the Bab: the other the appointment of a poor Prince to the governor-generalship of one of the Provinces of Persia, for he swallowed up all the taxes. I short Mirza Ki Khan Minister was a master of system and organization. Within the short space of two years he {{p5}} drilled and fitted one hundred regiments - a disciplined army. He systematized all the departments and established their foundatious upon a solid basis. Although he had never been in Europe yet he introduced many wonderful social and political reforms. One of the most puzzling questions of that time and even today - was the proper distribution of the salaries of the government employees. Often the arrears would accumulate to such an extent that the Minister of Finance would reduce their to a third or a forth. This caused great many complaints and dissatisfaction on the part of the clerks and the employees. For whom they did not receive their salaries in time, they borrowed according to the sum which the government owed them and the sudden reduction {{p6}} brought the creditors to their doors. However this prime Minister so reorganized the Finances of the country that the first day of every month, every employee received a small package with his name written on it, containing his full salary. This in itself was considered nothing short than miracles. But the Ministers fearing his control and power, poisoned the mind of the Sbah that this man was ambitions and desired to usurp the throne. The Sbah believed them and caused him to be Killed in the most atrocious manner.

His address today was a series arrangement against ascetiasin and monkesh meetings which claim that man attains to God through such severe disciplines and abstaining from food or enjoying the benefits of the world which God in His mercy has prepared for us. Therefore you strive, he said, that you may attain to God through the Fire of His Love, through the Door of His Knowledge, through morality of saints, through good deeds and through the susceptibilities of capricious. This is the Path of all the prophets of God.

In the afternoon the Master attended the meeting arranged for him by L'Albauce Spiritualiste 14 Rue hall and many people were present. The President and the {{p9}} General Secretary delivered short introductory addresses. The President said: Abdul Baha is today the Perfect Representatives of the Spiritual Forces of the East and the West. Hestands on a high mountain of ideal truth and he summons all of us to cable this mountain so that we may enjoy his association. He does not care much which road we may take to reach to him but he replies we will take the shortest possible road, do not tarry too long on the way and let not our senses be allured by temptations which are on two way, nor should we become discouraged by any obstacles which may suddenly appear in one path: He causes to us after a victorious trip from America where he has travelled and between for many mouths.

<10> 

Abdul Baha spoke " World Peace and the brotherhood of the East and the West." The audience was interested and sympathetic.

{{p11}}

Today I was all alone in an automobile with Our Beloved, driving from the afternoon meeting to Mooyer El Mawalebs aforted. On the way I thought to myself; what a heavenly privilege! What divine Bestowal! Really it is impossible to appreciate all these gifts which are descending upon us every day. Just think of it that from away at all the people of the world he choose, are as humble as myself with him and travel with him all these mouths. It made me realize more than any other {{p12}} his all-encircling mercy! All the way. I was wrapped up in this thought; Here I am sitting beside the Paradise of Life; the fountain of Truth the Standard - bearer of Universal Peace, the Mystery of God, the Outer of the Covenant, the sun of reality, and the Unifier of nations! Can my limited mind grasp this unlimited blessing! Have I anything in this world precious and dear enough to give up wonder to show my appreciation of this Beauty? I have my life but even life is nothing compared to this gift.

Oh me! If I could only do something if I could render some service.

I saw tonight the colored photograph of the Master. Very beautiful. Ahmad

Mr. Louis Le Leu Secretary of the Alliance Spirituality Paris Feb 21st 1913

Ladies and gentlemen,

In the month of Nov. 1911 the Master Abdul Baha during his first visit to Paris accepted the invitation of the Alliance Spiritualinte and we have kept the loving memory of that beautiful meeting.

Ana now, Master after a year of great work in the United - States and in many large cities of Europe, work which was crowned by success, recalling our first brotherly reception, you accept to be with us again.

We thank you deeply, for as you know the Alliance  Spiritualiste is pursuing an ideal which, while respecting all forms of thought and all modes of convictions, tends to bring together, through study and a rational knowledge of things, the scattered rays of truth to their natural center.

You have a place of honor among us through your doctrine which contains the highest human and divine views.

{{p15}}

Are we not after all the children of one father who is in Heaven and we all desire the glorification of his light in our minds and in our hearts; for the future of humanity depends on the development of conscience which allows to comprehend the sovereignty of Divine Truth and who today as in the days of yore, will open men's spiritual eyes, if not such men as you, the servant of Light.

Perhaps people will be astonished to observe the courage and conviction with which we speak of universal peace, at a moment when among all the nations one only hears of universal war and the increasing armies. But if the entire world is delivered tomorrow to the Glory of holocaust and the blood of innocents is then like water, our imperative duty is to call men themselves reminding them that they are {{p15}} brothers and that war is the work of iniquity. While weeping over the vow of the future and proclaim the hope which it contains.

We must proclaim again and again to that over us conflicts and the spirit of darkness that excite them that above the divisions of race, seek and egoisme lover supreme competition whose only wink is the end of its error.

We must lead men to the vantage ground where they can behold the coming dawn of brotherhood which brings with a consolation for all their grief and a cure for all their ills.

We are sure that erelong this sun of universal cosmic conscience of humanity will demand of its last idol, a bank account of its tears of its blood, and its soul; and upon the scatter ruins of its land's temple of folly, it will build in its heart a supreme alter of Meadow.

{{p16}}

That day perhaps is afar of, because it will be the day where in the Spirit of Eternal Love which is the Spirit of Eternal justice will reign everywhere.

But we desire to be ranked among those who are working for the future freedom of humanity, therefore we proclaim the unity of Light the unity of Love, the unity of life.

Like unto us Abdul-Baha you are working for the realization of that sublime work and as us, you know that if the Light comes from the Orient, it is also written that the soul of the Accident will be the throne of that Light.

Your presence among us, is a living symbol of this great effort of the elite of all races towards the accomplishment of the radiant promise of the Splendor of God.

{{p17}}

We Alliance Spiritualiste is happy to receive again Abdul Baha, the leader of the Bahai movement who, a year ago for the first time spoke to its members and friends.

We are happy to linked to him again with a religion spirit.

You noble and generous hearts who are willing to work for the happiness of human kind instruct humbly, to think, to reason; see what she need.

It is an ideal who will carry her above this physical flame.

Humanity must realize its high destiny!

To the great thinkers of our time, I ask them {{p18}} if they don't believe that our century has more intelligence than heart, and I beg of them to find the treason.

For myself I beleive the reason is the back of ideal. The simple faith of our fathers not being sufficient for us and the heart not being able to find in it, the necessary food, has become atrophied.

Intelligence on the contrary, owing to the marvel Paris discovery of science, has found everywhere a great variety of food and in abundance, and has thou been able to developed itself, at the expense of the heart, who cannot {{p19}} then perceis the secret of its destiny.

O century! If you wish to accomplish your task, you must see that the heart vibrates with the intelligence. For this you must work incessantly to give to the world a scientific faith.

At all times, thinkers have had far mission to enlighten the nations and to bring them to the greatest conceptions of the human mind. At our time, an immense desire of reasoning all the transcendental love of nature, have united the modern thinkers in a waste fraternity.

{{p20}} 

Let us greet these noble efforts, who are allowing us to hope that where the principle that govern all things, will be recognized by them, the regulator will then accept it and apply to all.

We must love one another. Two contrary forces are contending with each other. Love and hatred. Love give to the world peace and harmony. Hatred gives war: war of social classes, war of people, war of races.

Spirituales to by their love of human kind consolidate the forces of divine love {{p21}} and will arrive to conquer hatred.

At this meeting Abdul Baha represents the spiritual force of the Orient. All the spiritualists of the Occident are hoping that the universal Spiritual mind may bring about this law of love, who alone, can unite the Orient and the Occident.

Dear Harriet!

In these days of wars and rumors of wars the clarion call of Peace, is being raised from Paris. One thing that strikes my mind more forcibly than anything else is the unwavering faith, the hopeful assurance, the radiant confidence, the inspiring optimism, the burning conviction and the unflinching trust of the Beloved. It is all right to talk or write on these things but to actually live them is a different story. Which the greatest men and the acutest minds are doubtful of the future of humanity; while they are engaged in bloodshed and destruction; while the horizon of it is the world {{p2}} enveloped in gloom, while nations are increasing their armies and navies the Master aided by the Holy Spirit heralds the dozen of universal Peace and international unity. His voice is hearkened by the people of all louds. Why? Because his shining vision of the future glories destined for the human race is newer dimmed. In his presence hopeful; the coward, courageous; the timed, intrepid, and the warlike a peacemaker. These is a period of discouragement and hopelessness in the life of every man but the Master besides being hopeful creates the same attitudes of mind in others. He goes on teaching and imparting knowledge and illumination to those who are deprived. Well is it for those who practice his behests!

{{p3}}

This morning he was in a happy and reminiscent mood. Tea was served by the even- faithful Layad Assadullah and he inquired from Aga Faraj; what was the difference between the weather in Paris and Teheran? He answered for the present the Paris weather was like spring. The related suffering of cold icy night on his way from Teheran to Gazwin. The road constructed by the Russians some 22 yrs ago and therefore the passengers were taxed. There were five carriages with many stages on the road where the horses were renewed and the journey continued. It takes three days to reach Rasht from Teheran. This road was for nearly 12 yrs in the hand of a Baha by the name Bager off whose eldest son Mis Abdullah was one of the Persians who travelled with Haji Ameen to London and participated in our interesting experiences. Well, through the splendid management of this road, Bageroff became a wealthy man and well-known for his charity and philanthrophy. About two yrs ago the Master wrote him to lighten his load of work and worry. He gave up the management of the Road and the Russians bound a Foroostrian by the name Bahman to super intend it. But here comes the interesting part of this story just at the final agreement, Bahman causes to Bageroff and begs him not to give up the work entirely, but became his partner - so that he may be impart to the management hisexperiences Bageroff accepted the proposition {{p5}} and they drew a contract that in case either party goes back on this arrangement, he will pay to the other ten thousand dollars. When Bahman meets the Russians, he hears many extravagant stories of how Bageroff had become wealthy by holding the Road for 12 yrs. His cupidity was excited and he signs the agreement without mentoring the name of Bageroff. He accept full responsibility and without any devial or resentment on his part he goes to the bank, gets ten thousand dollars and delivers it to Bageroff. This was money dropped from sky. Wasn't it? Well, the scale of business turned in such a fashion that Bahman lost everything and he finally was obliged to borrow fifty thousand dollars to pay his debts and the Road. 

{{p6}}

This was in brief the story related to the Master by Aga Faraj. Our Beloved tells us in turn another story:

At the time that His Holiness Baha-ullah was in the mountains of Subymaniah one of the young rugged, illiterate kinds living in the valley cause to see Him. The Blessed Perfection was kind to him and his love grow for Baha-ollah. His name was Mollah Ali Mardan. Although he had the title of "Mullah" yet he was illiterate. He did not know anything about "faith" but ardently adored Baha-ollah. Everyday he would leave his flock and go to the cave to hear the Blessed Perfection speak. Finally the time came that Baha-ollah through the pleading of the friends returned to Bagdad and a new life and hope were infused in their bodies. Shortly after {{p7}} the return of Baha-ollah the father of Mulla Ali Mardan tolf him that he save him depressed and gloomy. If thou desirest to go to the "Holy Man", than mayst go." The young man was beside himself with joy and left the valley instantly. When he arrived in Bagdad he came right to Baha-ollah. He had a round felt hat on his head and rough woolen -cowel clothes, very picturesque. As he was a most simple man he mixed his Persia with Kurdish dialed and the result was very amusing. Baha-ollah received him with graciousness and open arms. As the inspector of the custom-house was a devoted follower of the Blessed Perfection He sent for him. When he arrived, Baha-ollah pointed Mulla Ali Mordan to him. This is my friend " He said" I hope you will give him a position in {{p8}} the custom House." "Very well" the inspector respectfully answered and the "friend" of Baha-ollah was properly installed in work with good wages. By degrees he advanced and all his associates liked him because he was willing to serve and to learn. One day he came to Baha-ollah and said: my father and mother and my relatives are in great need and poverty. I must assist them. The Blessed Perfection told to be confident; God will greatly assist thee and will make thee prosperous. The Inspector next day increased his wages and made with him an agreement, that of all the profits, he allows him a 3 per commission. The first year Mullah Ali Mardan made a net sum of $8000. Immediately he sent seventy mile-loads of clothes and utensils rice, candy, tea, coffee etc to his family. The next step was his partnership with the Inspector. The latter, however {{p9}} getting too old in service and desiring to retire from the field was looking around for an abb successor. The "friend" of Baha-ollah fulfilled all his requirements and to the amazement of the people of Bagdad, Mullah Ali Mordan was one gain morning given the official position of the Inspector of the custom House. Who was this illiterate Kurd who was constantly climbing up? Everybody was curiously inquiring. But he managed the custom affairs so wisely and introduced many reforms in the administration that everybody was released. Later he bought a house and remodeled it and sent for his family. At the time, there was a great merchant in Bagdad who had a daughter. There were many suitors for her hand but everyone were rejected. One day Mullah Ali Mordan come to Baha-ollah and without any introduction sand: I desire to marry the daughter of this merchant.

{{p10}}

No one would have believed for a moment that such a thing was possible; but strongly enough the merchant accepted him as his son-in-law. Great preparations were made for the wedding and the bridegroom expended several thousand of dollars; giving many feast and invited the poor of the city. The wedding was one of the principal social events. A child was born to him and in time he become famous throughout those parts. He served the government in a deal with a Jew and as a reward for his signal services, he was decorated and received a title. Many merchants knowing that he was Bahai, claimed that they were Bahais too and thus get either reduction on duties or caused them to get and free. When Baha-ullah heard this; He asked him why did he  rely on the pretenses of these merchant He said, because {{p11}} they mention the name of Baha-ullah and I do not want them to be disappointed; otherwise I know that they are not telling the truth." He would come after into the Presence of Baha-ollah and say: 'Oh My Lord, through your mercy and bounty I have become a King.' Were it not for your care and protection I would have now been living in the mountains, tending my flock but now I am a King; a King because I have acquired all this wealth; a greater King, because I have your love with this love I am greater than all the Kings of the world. Abdul Baha with Doctor Mohamad Khan a wonderful Declaration of the Cause for a phonograph. On his return he read it to us. It is full of power and potency. He said, they have {{p12}} tired him because they made him repeat the words and raise his voice to a high pitch.

Today's address was the interpretation of the verse of the Gospel 'I have many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. Howbeit when the comforter or the Spirit of Truth cometh he will lead you unto all truth." It was a clear explaination necessary for the Christian Bahais to know its conditions. 

About six o'clock the Master invited by our neighbor down stairs and he took me to himself there entering I found their apartment {{p13}} were some people from Casta Rica; who had 13 lived in New York many years, they were coffee merchants and as devout catholics, they had made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. They wanted to know who the Master was and what was his religion?" I am a Bahai! the Beloved answered, "We have never heard the name. Will you tell us about it? "They asked. Then he gave them the message in a very simple way. "And for these teachings they put you in prison?" they raised their voices in fastest. Afterwards the Master presented a piece souvenirs of semi-precious stones for rings and to others ancient pieces of money.

Dear Harriet!

The Master said: When the Cause is well-founded in Paris, there will be other emotions, other susceptibilities and other attractions. Although Paris compared with other countries is hovering, in a general way little attention to spiritual problems, yet under the education and training of Our Beloved there are signs and traces of a spiritual springtime. In future the people will become awakened as though from a deep slumber and know who was amongst them and what wonderful teachings he has left behind! Then to their great disappointment they will realize that they could not get for all the wealth of the world the gift that they could receive from Abdul Baha freely, without money and without price! What is this gift? To behold the Countenance of the Beloved; to hear words of benediction from his Holy lips, to stand in His Presence and to serve Him in every possible way. These Favors have been showered upon so many people in America and especially upon so many believers. I hope everyone will appreciate duly these divine Gifts and in order to demonstrate his appreciation he will arise to spread the message and make mindful those who are scattered by Abdul Baha in America must be well matured so that millions of harvest may be gathered. If everyone of the friends decides to really teach one soul in a year, every year the number would be doubled.

{{p2}}

This morning immediately after drinking tea the Master called me to go out with him. It was hardly eight o'clock. He called on Mon. and Madame Dreyfus; they were of course sleep but soon Mon. Dreyfus was in His Presence; after a while Madame Dreyfus too came in. He talked with Mon. Dreyfus about a most prominent Persian statesman just arrived from Azarbaijan. Mon. Dreyfus had already invited him to dinner for Tuesday night so that he may meet the Master. He said that during an interview he had related to him the wonderful visit of the Beloved to America and his addresses before Universities, Colleges, churches, clubs etc. and he was much impressed. After awhile the Master returned home and I presented to him the petitions of some of the friends and he revealed wonderful Tablets for each.

{{p3}}

At half past ten Madame Dreyfus announced the presence of several new people who were longing to have a few moments each with the Master. I have no doubt that all those people who meet Abdul Baha receive such a heavenly Benediction that they will never forget it throughout their lives. Each hour spent at his divine Threshold is equal to an age. In the storm and street of this time, we may not have time to think of this but in the near future, we will dwell on these days as the most precious in our lives. The greatest gift in this world is the love and kindness of a Blessed Personage who only thinks of one's progress and illumination.

{{p4}}

It was noon when the Master entered the Parlor to greet the waiting crowd. He smiled his heavenly smile winning the hearts and attracting the souls. His talk was against the theories of the agnostics who claim that was nothing beyond this physical life, that after this, there is an eternal sleep. Then he summed up his address: He hoped that the intellectual powers of those who were present may advance, then ideal knowledge may grow and the circle of their thoughts may widen- so that they may discourse the divine worlds- worlds which are infinite. Just as these phenomena are infinite as regards to their forms and species, likewise the worlds of God are infinite. May they become informed everyday with a new mystery! May they obtain everyday a new life, may they unveil everyday a new reality- so that they may find entrance to all the worlds of God.

{{p5}}

In the afternoon Madame de Sacy with her mother and her children and Madame D'Astre came to see Our Beloved. As the daughters are being educated in the Catholic Convent, they have become most devout and zealous in that forth. Half jokingly half seriously the Master carried a religious discussion with one of the young girls whom I think is not older than 14 or 15 years old. She was clever in her own way, quoting the traditions of the church, verses from the Bible etc etc. The talk was most interesting as it touches baptism; the interpretation of the Word; the saying of John the Baptist that he was not Elias, and Christ saying that he was. At last the Master finished the discussion by saying: Christ and the Bible be for us; the Pope and all the priests be for you. We follow Christ and not the priests. We give more importance to what Christ said that what the Popes and the Cardinal say. We are the followers of Christ. We love him and we always ready to sacrifice our lives for him.

{{p6}}

At this time Rasheed Pasha and Moneer Pasha (former Ambassador of Turkey to this city) entered and the discussion came to an end. Both these men kissed the hands of the Master. For more than one hour the Beloved spoke to them in Turkish about America, his tour and his 40 years old of imprisonment. When they left, he was very tired. He went to his room to rest for a minute and when Nostrat-Doubt with his younger brother arrived he came out to meet them. They arose from their seats and he welcomed them. Although he was very tired yet he spoke with them for a full hour.

{{p7}}

Some of the things he said: Sultan Abdul Hamid imprisoned him forty years. At one time Abdul Hamid became very suspicious because his species reported to him that Abhas Offendi was carrying a large correspondence with America. So he gathered 200 letters which had just arrived and mailed them to the Sultan's private secretary to be translated and read to him. When the Sultan reach them carefully, he inquired from his Secretary, whether there was anything else in those letters that might incriminate Abhas Effendi: No. There was nothing else, he answered. Then the sultan said: These letters are very strange indeed. I do not know what to do with Abhas Effendi. Suppose all the Bahais are destroyed by the Shah in Persia and suppose I also kill those living in my country. what are we going to do with these American Bahais? It is impossible to do away with them. I am puzzled what course to take.

The secretary said: "I have often said to your Majesty that these people are not interfering with Politics. It was better to leave them to themselves because if any harm came to Abhas Effendi at this time, his followers in America will create many complications for you, which will be most difficult for any of us to unravel."

Rasheed Pasha who was here today was once the most powerful governor general of Syria and was moreover the confident spy of Abdul Hamid. All the inhabitants of Syria were afraid of him. If he reported by cable to the Sultan that any man or any number of men were plotting against him. Abdul Baha wrote a few Americans had come to see him; that they had a member of religious and scientific questions to ask and if he thought their stay in Syria has in any way against his policies he would send them away. But the governor answered: Oh no! We are very proud to have a man amongst us who can attract the American people through his wisdom and knowledge.

Our two guests having departed he went out again with Doctor Mohamad Khan. These days he is becoming so restless, and I believe our Paris sojourn is drawing to a close. He returned after one hour and ordered dinner but he did not eat himself. Faithful Sayad Assamdullah, however kept a dish to be carried to his room about eleven o'clock.

Love to all.

Dear Harriet!

In his address today Our Beloved made some striking statements. It was on "Word and Deed". In the Bahai Dispensation, he emphasized his point by rising from his chair, near the window, and walking back and forth, the question of deed is most important. Confession and acknowledgement do not mean Faith. Faith means Deeds and Deeds means Faith. If a Bahai is confirmed in Deeds, he is accepted. His faith in and acknowledgement of the Station of Baha-o-llah do not bring him in the rank of the people of the Kingdom of Abha. In order to be accounted as a Bahai, he must live in accord with the Teachings of Baha-o-llah; he must become a center of {{p2}} Merciful emotions; the rays of the sun of perfection must emanate from him; he must be kind to all the inhabitants of the earth; he must strive to become a cause of general welfare; he must consider his enemies as his friends; he must return justice for injustice; he must look upon all humanity - the rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, the high and the low, the aristocrat and the democrat, the employer and the employee, those who live in the Mansion and those dwell in dark, cold, wretched tenement-houses, those who are well-fed and those who have no bread to eat - as members of his own family; he must know and believe that the whole earth is his native land and he must be sympathetic with all the people. He must cheer up those who are in sorrow and carry laughter and the sunbeams of {{p3}} happiness in the hearts of the children of humanity. To the sick, he must become a nurse. To the oppressed, he must be a shelter. To the extent of his ability, he must assist and take care of the poor in the community. He must give a share and a portion to those who are deprived. He must be a balm of healing to every wounded and a breath of spirit to every dead. In short, he must demonstrate his love for all the people through every loving means. Just as light appear through an illumined lamp, likewise these deeds must appear from a person who calls himself a Bahai; otherwise one does not become a Bahai by merely acknowledging the station of Baha-o-llah. These are the qualities of a Bahai. If such lights emanate from a person, he is a Bahai; if these rays do not emanate from him he is only a Bahai by name. {{p4}} When we say "man", we imagine in our mind certain attributes with which "Man" is imbued! When we say "star" , by this word we designate a light-giving Stellar body. When we say "tree", it must yield fruits. When we say the word "perfection", we look forward to its manifestations. Otherwise it is a word without meaning, a name without significance. These were the words of the Master which he himself has already translated into deeds of living fire and potency. I hope all of us will become assisted in these services.

When I presented myself this morning in the reception room, the Master was already there. Apropos of a very great Persian nobleman who had come to see him the day before he said: The Kingship of the earth was like unto an empty {{p5}} walnut shell but the spiritual Kingship of a real Bahai was like unto a walnut full of meat. Then he corrected the many Tablets which were revealed by him the other day. Amongst them one for Miss Harriet Majee and another for Mrs. Clarence Moore. Both are translated and await his signature. They will be mailed soon.

Mirza Mehdi Khan, the brother of Naser-ul Malik, the regent of Persia paid a call to Our Beloved. I heard that he was appointed Persian Minister to the United States and I think he is on his way to America. He is a tall, very striking man, full of activity and good humour. {{p6}} In the afternoon, several Persians came to visit him and the discussion was now about Persia and again America.

At five o'clock at Mrs. Scotts' studio, the usual Monday meeting was held. Mon. and Madame Dreyfus were not there, so again I was called for the second time since our arrival in Paris to translate for the Beloved. The Master asked Mrs. Bernard and then Madame Richard to speak first. Both spoke with great courage and enthusiasm; the first in English, the second in French. He is giving them wings with which they may fly when he leaves Paris and is training a few such men and women for public service. Both these women are able speakers and sincere Bahais; so he has {{p7}} told them to speak in every meeting and rest assured that Baha-o-llah will inspire their hearts. He said, you must speak in every gathering. You must set the hearts aglow with the fire of the Love of God. You must shine like unto stars. You must illumine this city. If these conditions do not realize, there will be no fruits. Go out and speak. Speak with great determination. Turn your face to Baha-o-llah. Forget everything else. Forget yourselves. When they finished speaking, he came out and gave a stirring address on the trials of Baha-ollah and the heroism of Bahai martyrs.

On our return home, Aga Faraj spoke with me of his experiences as a baker for I love to talk with him. He is simple and {{p8}} direct. "No I would not have come to Paris were it not for the sake of seeing the Master." he said "I love Persia because to a Persian, religion means life or death. If you speak with a man about the Bahai religion, if he does not kill you, he will ridicule you; then in the bottom of your heart you feel joy; but what do I see here? With whomsoever you speak about the Cause, he shrugs his shoulders and says Oh! "tres bien, tres bein." He does not ridicule neither does believe, as though religion means nothing to him. It is strange! Isn't it? Then he confided to me a great seeist: "Really, I know of a certainty that there are times when Abdul Baha leaves aside all his other works and comes to my assistance and it seems as though has no one else in this wide world to help but me! Is not this wonderful?"

{{p9}}

We reached home, the Master had arrived. I was thinking of the great faith and trust of Aga Faraj, at the simplicity and purity of his spirit and at the unconscious grandeur of his life, a life devoted to service, to loving kindness, to charity, to Deeds of which the Master was speaking this morning and then I heard the still, small voice in my own heart: "He is a real Bahai!" and the voice grew stronger and more powerful till I heard its echo reverberating in all the corners of my body: He is a real Bahai! After all, Faith in God and trust in his goodness will be the materials out of which the palace of human prosperity shall be constructed. This idea become firmly established in my heart when I entered the room and heard the Master speaking the following words to a number of people standing in his presence: {{p10}} When a person desires to destroy his house to build a new one on its site, first of all, he must make the plan ready, then the bricks, the stones, the lime etc, and then engage in the demolition of the old building. It is true that the present day religions are like dilapidated houses. The religion of Baha-o-llah is preparing slowly yet assuredly the materials out of which the Temple of Humanity shall be constructed. What are the materials? They are Faith in God, the love of God, the Knowledge of God, and trust in God. It will also use in the construction of new Temple all the good materials which are found in the old buildings. It will indeed be a glorious palace of God wherein all His children shall abide forever in peace, joy and love. {{p11}} In the following pages I will try to write two stories that I have heard from the Master on different occasions for the last two days.

The inhabitants of one of the provinces in Persia desired to get rid of the burden of Military Conscription, laid upon them by the Minister of war. A man said, he will do something and exempt the provinces from this law. The people became naturally delighted. Now in Teheran, there is a military square in the center of which they have mounted on a platform, a great cannon; so this man got a hearse and bringing it near this platform stationed himself beside it and started to cry, bemoan and lament. The passersby asked him, what is the matter? He said: This friend of mine dropped dead here. He was a poor {{p12}} man, please contribute something for his burials. Everybody gave him something. But the hearse was empty. At twelve o'clock the Minister of war came out of his office and seeing a crowd went to investigate. When the man saw the Minister of war approaching he increased cries and lamentations. "What is this?", the Minister inquired. Your Highness, this man from the province of ------- dropped dead here. He was a stranger amongst us and I am trying to collect a fund from these noble citizens for the expenses of his burials. "How it did happen that he died in this place?" Your highness, it is a very sad story. It shows the tender sensibility of this man which was a marked characteristic of the inhabitants of the province of -------. {{p13}} As he passed by the soldiers were practicing. He heard the noise of the first gun and his whole frame shook. He heard the noise for the second time and he fell to the ground. The third booming of the cannon caused his death. The Minister placed five frones in the man's hand and went away. Tomorrow a law was promulgated that the province of ------- was exempt from military conscription.

There were three persons who started to journey together. One was from the province of Tabriz, the other from the province of Esphahan and the third from the province of Kashan. On their way, they were discussing the probability of being attacked by the highwaymen. The man from Tabriz said, if we are attacked by the robbers, he will unsheathe his sword and kill as many as he can. {{p14}} The man from Esphahan said "I will make a big bluff, if you still four, I will brandish my sword and cry out why, I am going to put an end to all of them by killing ten." The man from Kashan said, he will open the baggage, spread the table and have a feast. It so happened that they were attacked by the robbers. The Tabrizi killed four, the Esphahani commenced a big demonstration that he will do this and that and the Kashani was calmly eating. The robbers seeing this, reasoned amongst themselves: If the first man killed four; the second man must be more terrible, for he is boasting that he will kill every one of us, and what the third man will not do when he has finished eating! He will certainly be dreadful foe! Let us take to our heels.

Dear Harriet!

The days of the Master in Paris are spiritual, divine, dedicated to the service of God and man. He seeks to spread the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abha, to diffuse the holy fragrances of the garden of sanctity, to sow the seeds of love and affection, to educate the souls how to release themselves from the fetters of self and teach the people through what way they draw  nigh unto God. For the head of the future humanity, he is fashioning a most glorious diadem, the brilliant jewels and scintillating gems of which are going to be the good deeds and actious of all the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful. The sooner these jewels are gathered, the more quickly the diadem will be made ready. When these gems are presented to the Heavenly Silversmith, he will only select the purest, the clearest, and the most beautiful. He will throw away all the counterfeits. Will he not? A jeweler whose eyes are trained to distinguish the glass from diamond, the imitation from the real, the precious stones from the rockeries will never make any mistake. In the same manner the Divine Jeweler will not be mistaken. We cannot carry to him glittering cut glasses and tell him, these are genuine diamonds. Accept these for the setting of the Crown of humanity. Let us suppose that out of his mercy he does accept our imitation stones. Are we going to doubt his Knowledge? Or force ourselves into a belief that our imitatious work just as nicely as the genuine ones and thus stalk abroad with vainglory? No! A thousand times no! Let us not belittle our own station in His Light. Are we not His children? Does He not love all of us? Has he not destined for us glorious station? Eternal Life and Everlasting Honor? On the other hand, are we willing to stood the crown of humanitywith such cheap, imitation stones? Let each one of us engage in prospecting the wonderful mines of his heart and mind. It is just as easy to take out of these quarries, the nuggets of gold and diamond as the cheap stones. The knowledge will be given to us if we are sincerely seeking. My greatest hope is that the American friends will bring before the Divine Jeweller more and more such ideal gems. Their display will make Abdul Baha very happy. He has given us the knowledge and the direction. Now is the time to work in the mines of human hearts and minds, select the most precious  stones, and present them to him. But let us always distinguish the real from counterfeit, so that our jewels may be worthy of the Glorious Crown of Humanity and their lustre and luminosity may be eternal.

This morning when we entered the room to pay our daily homage to the King of Kings he spoke about the life of the Bab. When his Holiness the Bab, he said arrived in Esphahan, Manutehelen Khan who has been converted from Christianity to Mohamadan religion was the governor of the City. From the beginning he was attracted to the Cause, but one day something happened that made him a believer. The Bab was present in a meeting with the governor when suddenly the arrival of the son of the Chief of the Ulemas of the City are announced. Having met the Bab he wanted to show his superior knowledge by propounding a quuestion. He said, "There are certain statements in the Koran. Are they addressed to those who were present or are they addressed to those who are absent? If they are addressed to those who were present, then they do not apply to us, we are free from any responsibilities; but if they were intended for those who were yet unborn, we were not there. How is it possible that God addresses those who are absent? Is this right? Is he going to punish us for non-compliance? How can you account for this contradiction?" The Bab simply answered, "In the presence of God, there is no Past, Present or Future. There is an Eternal Now." The Mullah finding himself completely defeated by this matchless simple answer said, "My father does not teach this way." The governor seeing that he was going to launch on the sea of vituperation said, "It is enough!" This was the beginning of his belief. Then Abdul Baha went on explaining the life and story of this Governor who did so much to protect the life of the Bab, otherwise, the Ulemas would have killed him in Esphahan and the history of the Bahai Movement may have been written otherwise.

{{p3}}

Many people arrived and the Master met them individually. At noon, he came out to give his public address. You could see in his face that he was weary and tired. He spoke of the attachment of the heart to various objects of life but how all of them recoded to insignificance when the heart obtained the Beauty of the Love of God! It is then that man will never be unhappy and his whole life will be devoted to philantropy and charity.

After the address he walk out with Mon. Dreyfus and it was after 11 o'clock when he {{p4}}returned. Sayad Assadullah invited Miss Hodgson to take lunch with us. She is a very attractive English girl, a lovely Bahai, a sweet Spirit. She has come especially from London to take down the Master's talks and has no other interest here.

In the afternoon Mayor Al Mamalek came to see our Beloved and bid him goodbye, for he is returning to his house tomorrow. The Master spoke about the prayers of the Cause in Persia and how all the princes and the members of the reigning dynasty are attached.

Love to all.

Dear Harriet!

Today our Beloved was not feeling well. He caught cold and the morning he interviewed the people while in bed. For the first time since our arrival in Paris he did not deliver his address and he was feeling too weak to get out. In the afternoon, many Persians and Turks came to see him and in the morning he sent me for Miss Sanderson. When she arrived, he talked with her about the situation of the Cause in Paris, how to conduct his meeting after his departure, what cause to pursue so that more and more people become interested. He told her that he testifies that his aim was pure, he shall ever pray for her. He wishes her to do something so that the whole city of Paris may become illumined. He was most pleased with her. Many of the friends hearing that the Master was not feeling well have sent large bouquets of flowers. His voice was hoarse and he spoke with difficulty. last night he slept very little and although he was not feeling well, while reclining in bed he received many visitors. As he was reclining in bed he made such wonderful pictures of spiritual power and majesty!

{{p2}}

The President of L'Alliance Spiritualiste came to see him with Madam D'Astre. I was sent by the Master to bid farewell to Mayor Al Mamalek who was going to leave tonight for Persia. On my return he was still in bed and calmness and wondrous tranquility were manifest in his prophetic face! He was speaking with the President of L'Alliance Spiritualiste. Doctor Mohamad Khan was sitting in the corner of the bed translating and rubbing his feet. Madame D'Astre was the listener. It seemed as though there has been much discussion before my arrival. Immediately i took out my notebook and wrote down the pearls of light and life falling from his sacred lips. His voice was low, and yes vibrating with strength, sweetness and sublimity.

You must looking at the President and smiling, sow the seed of love. They destroy, you construct. They take life, you confer life. Now is the time for work! To spread the law of Love at such a time is the greatest of all the works. Strive that the benign influence of Love permute through the hearts of all men. They are thinking and waging war, you practice peace and conciliation.

President Spiritualist Alliance: There are so few advocates of universal love, but there are many newspapers subsidized by the manufacturers of cannons and powders to write all the time of war and the glories of conquests. Abdul Baha: Never mind! The Will of God in this century is the promotion of Love amongst mankind. We must not look at the petty contrivances of the Militarists. Those things shall pass away and the Will of God will become victorious. Those who serve the cause of Love are confirmed. Let nothing discourage you. Cry out the word Peace. Push ahead. Seest thou not the light?

P.S.A.: In France the educated and cultured class "desire" peace and love.

A.B.: To "desire" a thing and to "work" for a thing are two different things. There is an individual of the army who sits in his own house, eats, sleeps, enjoys and talks about war. There is another member of the army who is in the battlefield, fighting the enemy and all the time gaining new laurels. The Bahai are the army who are in the thick of the fight all the time. Now in the right wing, again in the left and anon in the center. They do not rest one movement. The battlefield is crimsoned with blood of more than 20,000 martyrs. The generals are drilling new recruits all over the world.

P.S.A.: Amongst the mass of every nation there are always some whose aim is international Peace but their member has been so far in the minority.

A.B.: Universal Peace cannot be establish with the power of thought. One cannot make people love each other by the power of thought. Neither through scientific attainment or political capacity can this aim be obtained. This can only be accomplished through the power of the Divine Spirit. It is impossible to bring this about through any other means. If you strike one blow in the face of a peace-loving Westerner he will not only get angry but he will either draw his revolver or duffer.

P.S.A.: According to the old custom of feudalism, gentlemen when insulted by each other, fought duels but this is now forbidden by law.

A.B.: The Russian Emperor was the first Western Monarch to send out his famous declaration of Universal Arbitration, the result of which was the organization of the First Hague Conference, therefore he was the Organizer of the Congress. But after the termination of the Conference he was the first person proclaiming war. That's why it is impossible to put Universal Peace on a solid foundation without the assistance of the Divine Spirit. Thought is not a ruler over man. It often happens that ego becomes the rulers. Thought is one way, deed just the opposite way. For example, man thinks that justice is good, but the Ego steps in, whispers in his ears and he commits injustice. Science cannot become a governor over man, for use often witness that a man acts contrary to his best knowledge. For example, he is a physician, he knows that a certain food is not good for him yet he eats. Therefore, Spirit alone governs the body. Man is captive in the hands of Spirit. Man by his physical power alone cannot establish Universal Peace, only when the Divine Spirit has taken complete possession of the world of humanity. When the Hague Congress was organized, they asked Abdul Baha to what was his opinion in regards to it? Will there be any beneficial results issuing from it? He answered that the members of this Conference are like unto bar-Keepers who may convene a convention in which they may discuss the harms of wine-drinking, condemn intoxication, favor temperance and pass eloquent resolvations at their last session. But no sooner they come out of their gathering, they go right ahead, open their saloons and boom up their business. For we have seen that no sooner these worthy representatives returned home with their resolutions their respective governments disregarded them and went on adding to their naval and military expenditures, as though there was no Hague Congress at all.

P.S.A.: It is true! We are really very unfortunately situated in France. Those who love Peace, brotherhood and fellowship are either facialists,free thinkers or agnostics. They have abandoned God and religion, but they are philanthropists, social reformers and they think through their remedies the regeneration of the world will be possible. On the other hand, the part of the community which are religious, their thoughts are antiquated and out of time with the spirit of the time. Therefore those who have the so called religion are thinking of the God of battle rather than the God of Peace and those who have no religion are trying to being about brotherhood and unity, but they are unable because they lack religious fire, enthusiasm, dynamic energy which we find in the Bahai Revelation.

A.B.: Whosoever thinks of God will never think of war. These religions are the counterfeits and  their adherents are walking in the footsteps of their ancestors. A person who has not advanced toward God, will seldom be peace-loving. He may state it verbally, but when the occasion comes up, he will be the first one to throw down the gauntlet. The Freemasons believe in brotherhood. When the Germans besieged Paris, there were Freemasons on both sides whose theoretic principle was peace and brotherhood. Bismarck aid the Emperor of Germany were Freemasons but how did they measure by the standard of action? The French people, one morning, raised the Freemasons flung on the Fort. The Germans fired at it with their cannons.

Dear Harriet!

Our Beloved has not improved in his health, although he was up and even went out to call on the Persian Ambassador. In the morning he recieved the people in his room but did not give his daily address. Many people went away willingly because they knew this will give him rest and tranquility. While in his bed he dictated Tablets for the friends in Scotland. I read to him a few letters from the States snd Canada but he was not strong enough to answer them. In the afternoon the wife of Omar Pasha with two other ladies called and he recieved them graciously while in bed. Then Miss Sanderson came and the Beloved talked on Reward and Punishment.

In the afternoon the Master sent me and Mirza Mahmood to walk through Champ Elysee, Orc de Triomphe and Place de la Concorde and watch the floats of Carnival. There were tens of thousands people, watching the stupendous spectacle. We enjoyed the sight. It was about 5:30 when we returned.

Mon and Madame Dreyfus were doing everything in their power so the Master may recover quickly. We do not like see him sick but even when in bed, he does not rest and everyone is called into his presence. This morning one of the friends coming out of his room exclaimed, "Oh! He looks like a wonderful King! He is so majestic!"

{{p2}}

Let me quote for you some of his words. Translation of the Master is prayer in Mrs. Whyte autograph book, written just half an hour before leaving Edinburgh, Scotland.

"He is God! O Thou Kind Lord! These travelers over mountains and deserts and these wanderers over land and sea have built their nests and shelters for a few days in the home of this beloved maid-servant of Thine! We were engaged in singing Thy praises and chanted the songs of Thy Kingdom.

O Lord! endear this household in both worlds! Bless this home, illumine it forever and ever. Crown the head of Mrs. Whyte with the Diadem of the Everlasting Glory so that it's brilliant gems may shine upon centuries and cycles."

{{p3}}

A prayers delivered by Abdul Baha while attending the dinner of the children at Canongate School in Edinburgh, Scotland.

"He is God! O Thou Kind Lord! These beloved children are created by Thy Mighty Hand. They are the signs of Thy Omnipotence. Confirm them in their lessons. Make them successful in their studies so that when they reach the age of maturity they may arise in the service of the world of humanity. O God! These children are like unto pearls. Rear them in the shells of Thy Providence. Verily Thou art the Generous the Clement."

{{p4}}

On Temperance. "The question of drinking liquors is forbidden in the Tablets of Baha-Ullah. Unquestionably through the Providence and Favor of God this direful calamity shall at last be wiped away from the face of the earth."

{{p5}}

On Suffrage. "As regards the Woman's Movement, this likewise is one of the distinct principles of Baha-Ullah. Suffrage must be obtained through the acquirement of virtues, the expansion of the sphere of thought, the development and growth of intellects and hearts and the Spiritual, divine Power, and not through unseemly actions."

{{p6}}

The Cause in America. "I scattered pure seeds in America. All of you must strive to water them. This is conducive to the glorification of all."

{{p7}}

The future of the Cause. "This melody will create a great tumult throughout the regions and the rays of the Sun of Reality shall shine forth with such penetration as to Cause the blooming of the flowers of realities and significances in the gardens of the hearts and the souls."

{{p8}}

On the Covenant. "Today the center of the Covenant is the Asylum and the Shelter. There is no other shelter save him."

{{p9}}

Magnetic Power. "Today the Magnetic Power is the divine Confirmations and firmness in the Covenant."

{{p10}}

Point of Prayer. "In prayer and supplication turn your faces to His Holiness Baha-Ullah and be steadfast in the Testament , so that ye may behold yourselves on the apex of the Everlasting Glory."

{{p11}}

Future effect of Abdul Baha's trip to Scotland. "This event will adorn and illumine the pages of history for eternity. it shall never be forgotten. Although for the present, it may have little importance in the estimation of men, but in the future it will become the reigning melody of centuries and cycles."

{{p12}}

Exhortations. "Be happy. Let not thy thoughts be scattered. man under the circumstances of tests must be patient, must be firm, must be steadfast. Thou must withstand the trials with the power of thine heart. Know thou of a certainty that the sad events are ephemeral. They are not permanent. Like unto the fleeting shadows they shall vanish. Let thy trust be in God, for He is the Eternal and the Everlasting. Live thou in the station of resignation and contentment so that thy heart and soul may obtain peace and serenity. Do thou ever possess the immensity of heart. Be thou stirred with divine glad-tidings."

Love to all.

Dear Harriet!

Praise be to God. Our Beloved is better, but still physically weak. Since his arrival in America I had never seen him so sick. The last four days sickness was the result of constant activity and speech-making. It was really reaction, precipitated by a seven cold. The day was spent quietly, the stream of callers coming and going, the telephone kept busy by the anxious ones who could not come personally. The morning was opened by receiving a bouquet of very large and magnificent pink and yellow azaleas from Mon. and Madame Dreyfus. It adorns the center of the Salon, surrounded by smaller pots, the gifts of loving hearts.

The Master had his tea in his own room and although we were deprived seeing him outside , his love was so great that he called us to his heavenly presence and talked to us on spiritual health.

{{p2}}

A cablegram was sent to Haifa so that Rouha Khanom, the daughter of the Master, who has been sick start for Paris without delay, Rouha Khanom will travel with her husband and will bring with her Sakeeneh Sultan, the wife of one of the martyrs who has been serving in the  Master's house. Then this I understand, we may tarry in Paris yet awhile; the Stuttgard trip still in the future.

{{p3}}

Another thing, which shows how the Master looks after every detail, even while in bed, he called and asked me whether the articles in the "Theosophic Messenger" of Scotland were yet translated into Persian. I answered, "No. Do it then." So all morning i was translating, and in the afternoon they were mailed to various centers. I have sent copies of newspapers and magazines to as many friends as I knew and I hope they have all received them.

{{p4}}

Another interesting event of the day was the discovery of a poet in the person of Aga Faraj. We could see it coming on him for the last three days. Having passed through the process of germination, the seed suddenly bloomed forth and the poetic ideas were strung together. He cannot write, so he had to push into service Mirza Aga Khan and Doctor Mohamad Khan as his secretaries.

Just before noon, the Master feeling better and having met several people in his own room, came out and sat near the window. All the Persians gathered in his presence. Mischievously, Doctor Mohamad Khan announced with great solemnity the wonderful poetic discovery. The Master alert as even turned to Aga Faraj and asked him to read his poems. He protested, but in order to encourage him, the Beloved recited for him some ridiculous verses written a Kashani Aga Faraj compatriots. Thus encouraged he got up to recite the children of his brain. With great assurance he started, the Master smiling and praising him, but finding some words that he could not read he had to ask the help of his secretaries. It was very amusing! Of course, the Master laughed and all of us laughed. "You have done well", the Beloved said. "Let no one say from now on that Kashan does not produce a acerbated poet. You have also two able secretaries to write down your inspirations, the prophet Mohamad had only one."

He told us a story about the time of Baghdad: Several Bahais lived in hall room so small that one could hardly move in it. But they did not care for these outward comforts, and having the joy of heaven in their hearts when the evening they returned from their works; all night long they sung and chanted communes- so that their neighboors who had every comfort, envied them. At that time, a Persian who outwardly claimed to be a Bahai arrived in Baghdad. As he was not going to be permanently located in the city- he came and stayed with our friends in the small crowded room. Of course they did not mind him and hailed him as a brother, they expected he will enter into the spirit of their joy. But no, he started to criticize everything and make remarks on their congested quarter and its shabby apperance. One of these men, who was a simple Kashani, composed a verse addressing him.

O thou our honored guests! God has given us an imperial palace! Look at its lofty dome!

I wonder! What is the cause of thy rankling soul!

Of course Aga Faraj was pleased with this story. In order to thank the Master, he said: "Yes! Indeed I am overwhelmed with all the Bounties of Our Lord, but Doctor Mohamad Khan and Mirza Aga Khan are getting jealous of me." "Why?", the Master asked. "Because they see how fortunate I am to become so much the object of the attention of the Lord of Mankind." "It is not necessary for them to get jealous.", the Beloved smiled they can find out the reason by loving you and act as you act; then I will love them too. "But, no" Doctor Mohamad Khan protested, "We are not jealous of him at all, we are all the time helping him in writing down his success."

"That is right Aga Faraj!" The master said, "They are your secretaries, but next time they must write your poems in such clear types that you may be able to read them without their assistance." Then he turned to us and said: "I love Aga Faraj because when Ali Kuli Khan and his wife went to Teheran, he served them for several months. You do not know how he served them. From that time on I have always loved him. These services are the greatest proofs of his faith and assurance. Aga Faraj is the servant and the lover of all the friends of God. He is sincere."

In the afternoon Sapahdor, the great Constitutional leader of Persia, the one who dethroned Mohamad Ali Shah called on the Master and more than one hour they talked together. Many friends came to see the Master and each had a few moments. This being Friday night the Beloved sent all of us except Aga Faraj to the meeting. Mon. Dreyfus read from the Book of Baha-Ullah and then asked me to speak on the Master's trip in America which I did with the greatest pleasure.

I may just as well as write two of the stories that I heard the Master tell to some of the visitors.

A young man who was graduated from the College  applied for a position of teaching in a village far away from civilization. When he arrived at the village, the elders got together and consulted with each other how should they really know that this man was right in his claims. Finally one of them said, "I know how to find out." After his arrival, the elders call on the young man. The man who was going find out whether he was educated to write "cow" on the slate. He wrote it. This is not a the "cow" at all; I will show you how to write "cow" and forthwith he started to draw the picture of a cow. When he finished it he asked his friends, "Now look here" he said "I will let you to be the judges. I asked this young upstart to write "cow" and he wrote this small word here. In order to show him that he was a fraud and ignorant, I wrote one myself. Now which is the cow?" The verdict was against the poor, young teacher and he lost the position.

{{p8}}

Speaking about the fantastic hyperboles of the Sufists as regards the projection of the spirit out of the body and even the transference of the body from one place to another the Master told this story which is recorded in the Sufi literature and believed as possible by many devotees.

There was once a Sufi in Baghdad who on a hot summer day went to the Euphrates river with his water pitcher to carry water to his wife and children. Having arrived in the front of the river, he thought it will be well to bathe himself for a few minutes. he took off his clothes and went into the river. He had one dip under the water but when he raised his head, he saw himself he is in the river Nile in Egypt. He got out of the river, borrowed some clothes from the nearly villages and entered the City of Cairo. He lived there for 15 years, married and had seven children. One day he went to the bank of the Nile with other friends to bathe. When he entered in the cool water, one of his friends got near and pushed him under the current. He struggled to get above the water and when out of danger, he save himself in the Euphrates, his clothes and water-pitcher standing just where he had them 15 years. Calmly he got out of the river, putting on his clothes, filling the water-pitcher and going toward his home. Here he found his wife was waiting for the water. She received it without any murmur or surprise. After one year the Egyptian wife with his seven children, travelling from Cairo arrived safely in Baghdad and found the husband and the father to their great delight and happiness.

{{p9}}

There was once a Persian Bahai who was very hospitable and always entertained new guests. Although he was poor and did not have much yet everything he made he spent over such entertainments. One day a man called on him under the name of Bahai and he received him with open arms. This man stayed in the house one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks and he never went out. The host somehow found out that his guest was not really a Bahai, otherwise he would not spent his time lazily for Baha-Ullah has commanded everyone to work. Finally one morning he went to him and told him that he had stayed long enough, that he would like to entertain other guests; if he like to work, he will find for him something to do and if he desires to leave the city, he will give him his travelling expenses. "No, I do not want to do anything of the kind but I will tell you a secret. The holy spirit inspired my heart to stay in your home." The poor man did not say anything and left the house. In the evening he returned with a big stick and went for the man. "Oh for God's sake, what are you doing!" the guest pleaded, "Just half an hour ago, the Holy Spirit inspired me to go and get this big stick and drive you out of my house. There is no use for pleading. I must obey the command of the Holy Spirit."

The man had to leave the house.

Dear Harriet!

If the spiritual significances of Our Beloved's Trip throughout the Western countries cannot be fully realized, if the deeper aspect of his long journey for the last two years and half cannot be grasped by our mentality, at least we can see with our own eyes that the Bahai Cause is much better known than during all its previous history; its Teachings are widely spread, its principles well-known, its position well defined, its vital power acknowledge, its noble ideals admired, its heavenly thoughts and its objects and aims hailed as the very spirit of the this age. This marvelous transformation has come through the arduous trip of the Master throughout Europe and America. With one stroke, he made the Bahai Cause the most talked of movement of the day and as with one bound, he caused it to reach to such a high station of honor amongst nations that it could not reach by itself through its normal growth in 50 or a 100 years. For the last three or four years the periodicals, the magazines, the newspaper of every country have written all kinds of articles for a against the Bahai Revelation. The addresses of Abdul Baha before churches, clubs, peace Societies and other associations both in America and Europe will be the greatest spiritual heritage to future generations. They are the treasury which shall make rich all those who are poor; wise all those who are ignorant; satisfied all those who hunger and thirst after rig through and seeing all those who are blind. For they are not the heavenly made medicine for the ills of this world? He has indeed perfected the proof and summoned all nations together beneath the Flag of Unity.

The Master felt much better today. He was up sitting in his chain and receiving callers all morning, especially a Mr. Crew from Newfoundland who having read articles in Christian Commonwealth about the Cause became interested to the latent of journeying to London. Having arrived then, Lady Bloomfield guided him to Paris. He was received by the Master and much encouraged to teach the Cause in his own country. When everyone gathered in the Salon at room, the Beloved came out and spoke a few words saying that he felt today better. Therefore he came out to meet them but he was as yet too weak to speak. The sickness will pass away. He desired to tell them one thing. It was this: He longed to see all of them often. It was first decided that they may come before noon; perhaps some have not the time to come at that hour; therefore they may come any time; morning, noon before or after noon, evening, any time. He was going to pray for them. Everywhere he has been a great spiritual nation has been realized, the lights of the Teachings of Baha-Ullah shone forth and the Trumpet of the Kingdom was sounded. These conditions were not yet witnessed in Paris. Then he got up and went around shaking hand with everyone.

For the last three days he did not take his customary walk, deeming wiser to stay in until he felt stroupes. We have missed his presence at the table and we are like lost sheep for we like to have our Shepherd in our midst.

Sayad Assadullah told us an interesting story that is worth recording. When he was travelling through Persia teaching the Cause, once he arrived at a small cafe shop in the middle of the desert. It was situated far away from any habitation, many miles away from the city of Kashans. It was just before sunrise that he arrived there. It was not yet opened, so he knocked at the door. In a minute it was opened by a young boy who greeted him joyfully and conducted him in. Sayad Assamdullah asked him whether he could serve him a cup of hot tea. He said "yes". "But" he said "just bring a pot boiling water for he had a special kind of tea which he drank always". The boy looked at him curiously but went away. After a while he brought the water and once the tea was prepared. Sayad Assamdullah offered him a cup. The boy was more puzzled, for he said "It is strange! My father has also this brand of tea and which he has special guests he prepares it for them". Sayad Assamdullah did not think anything unusual in this, but the boy looked at him hard whether he did show any sign of surprise. When his better arrived he run to him and whispered in his ears. The man came in, greeted Sayad Assamdullah cordially and having nothing else to do they started to talk. He asked Sayad Assamdullah, "Where do you come from?" "From Gom." "Where were you before that?" "Oh! I was in Teheran." "And after that." "Tabriz." "HAve you travelled any further?" "I have been once or twice in Constantinopole on business." Sayad Assamdullah emphasized the words "on business" just for the sake of caution. "What other countries have you seen because it seems you are well-informed man?" "I have travelled through Egypt and Syria." "Have you journeyed long in Syria?" Silence. "What did you see or hear while in those countries?" "Many years have I spent in those parts." "In what locality did you stay?" Sayad Assamdullah observed that he was questioning him too far but he had to tell him the truth. "I came from Acca." No sooner did he uttered these word then the man jumped from his seat, embraced him and began to shoved many kisses upon him. He said, "I am a Bahai and I have rented this place in this God-forsaken desert just for the chance of entertaining the Bahais who pass by this part. I want you to stay here tonight." Sayad Assamdullah said: "I cannot stay. I must leave in an hour or two." "No. I will not let you go tonight. You will not deprive me of the happiness of hearing from your lips the news of Acca." Well, he had to accept the man's incessant entreaty. Toward noon he sent his boy to bring from his little form a watermelon and the boy returned with a big one in his arms. He could hardly carry it. When he brought it Sayad Assamdullah saw that the words of "Abdul Baha Abbas" were cut on the skin. He asked the father, "How it was that the name of the Beloved was engraved so beautifully on the watermelon?" He answered: When the watermelons are very small my boy goes to the farm and writes on each words of Abdul Baha Abbas and as they grow the words grow also until they reach to their present proportions. Can't you see the little boy going out in the heat of the summer and writing the name of the Master on the little watermelons? This was most a beautiful manifestation of childlike love! 

In the afternoon the Master after his rest came out of his room and sat in the Salon. All the Persians went there and we had a wonderful silent hour in His Presence. I do not know it affected the rest, but I assure you, it was an hour fraught with eloquence, although not a word was spoken. Tea was served and the Master went out quietly. We all sat down around the tea table and spoke together about the blessings and the benedictions which have encompassed all the world through the Love of the Beloved.

{{p4}}

At seven o'clock he came into the room and while walking he spoke slowly this: For the present in Paris we are all enjoyed in mentioning the name of the True One. We are all beneath the protection of the Blessed Perfection. During the life of Christ, those who believed in Him were counted of little importance and the enemies ridiculed the apostles. They said: This man had came and all that he could do was to mislead a fisherman here or a tax gatherer there. They laughed and scoffed at Christ. Now they can realized the importance of those days. We cannot at present conceive the greatness of this day, how we are protected beneath the outstretching hands of Baha-Ullah. In the future we will long for the recurrence of one minute of these days and it will be detainable.

In short, he ye mindful, be ye awake! Be ye engaged in the mention of God. You are beneath the protection of the Blessed perfection. You have taken a share and a portion from his Kingdom. Today all the eyes are blind! All the ears are deaf! All the tongues are tied. Praise be to God that you are beneath the shade of His Banner; You are firm in the Covenant. Thank God a hundred thousand times at every moment that you have become the recipient of such bounties. You must make yourselves ready so as to receive more and more of these heavenly graces. He went to his new poem.

Have you thought over the dates of the Master's departure from Alexandria for America- March 25th and his arrival in N.Y. April 11th? I wonder whether the friends would not clean it spiritually significant to celebrate those two days?

Dear Harriet!

It is now almost three months that Our Beloved has left the United States travelling through. England and France, spreading the lights of spiritual knowledge and upholding the cause of International Peace and human brotherhood. By the time he leaves for the East Europe will be receiving all the spiritual custom that it can contain. After his departure there will be time for reflection and retrospection. Many souls will come out of the present state of indifference and try to recover the past, but the past has been always irrecoverable. We must try to do what we can now and let the past and the future take care of themselves. We must pursue the highest ideal of humanity, spread the celestial Teachings and let not this golden opportunity slip out of our hands. If we do not serve the Course, if we do not differs the Fragrances of the Rose garden of Abha, others will step in and in a more efficient manner they will engage service. Our Beloved has shown us an example of self-sacrifice and exertion that is worthy of emulation. If he has shown such wonderful activity during the last two years and a half, what would he have done if he was young and at the prince of age? Of course we may not till the same amount of land that he has tilled and besides, we do not possess as many pure seeds as he possesses, yet we must daily increase our receptivity for greater services.

{{p2}}

This morning the Master came out and we had the happiness of drinking tea in his presence and listening to his words of truth. He asked Aga Faraj to read to him his new poems which he did with great alacrity and good humor and the Beloved was very amused. His poems have no rhyme or rhythms but they flow from the innermost of his heart and are naturally accepted by Abdul Baha. The Master humorously remarked that the secretary of Mohamad was Osman, the lame, and after the passing away of Mohamad, Osman was elected by all the people to the Khalifah position. Now what will happen to Aga Faraj's secretary Mirza Aga Khan Gaemmaganinic who is already a gentleman, enjoying a great position and honor he did not venture to prophecy!

The Crewe of Newfoundland arrived and the Master called him to his room. The subject was the importance of the Spirit. The physical body is accidental and inherent the quality of every accidental composition one of which is decomposition. For example, the inherent quality of a house demands that someday it be destroyed; it cannot stand forever. The inherent attribute of this body requires the ultimate return of each element to its original constituent. Neither through the power of thought nor prayer can this physical, material body become permanent. But the Spirit being composed of no material elements, being already an abstract entity, shall live forever. It is not subject to change and transmutation. The body is the cage. The Spirit is the nightingale. Once the bars of the cage are shattered, once the fetters of the prison-house are broken, the nightingale will soar toward the Rose-garden of Eternity and on the branches of the Tree of Life, it shall perch, singing sweetly the songs of Freedom and Peace. Once the nightingale is out of the cage, it will not even look at it. What does the free bird want to do with an old cage, even if it is made of gold? Do you want to keep the nightingale of your Spirit always within the confine of this narrow cage-body? Within the breast of this nightingale, a hundred thousand heart-rejoicing songs are hidden! Once out of the cage, it shall wing its way toward the Horizon of Everlasting glory and there join its heavenly voice with the celestial choir, ever singing, never dreaming of return.

Mr. Crewe expressed the desire to spread this gospel of light amongst his own people in Newfoundland. The Master assured him that he will be assisted. He is coming a form to more of to see him and then return to his home in the afternoon.

The Master called Miss Sanderson and inquired about the health of her mother. He told her: If you do something to infinite the Fire of this Cause in Paris I will be made most happy!

Last night Mr. and Mrs. Herrigel arrived from Stuttgart. Mr. Herrigel is a great worker in the Cause and has translated many of the Bahai works into German; spreading them all over the Fatherland. He is a man of Mr. W. Hoor and H. Harris physical type, a very sincere, whole-hearted firm Bahai!

When Mr. and Mrs. Herrigel entered the room they expressed their griefs at seeing the Master not well. The Master welcomed them saying: These are decedents which attack the body of man. His Holiness Christ says: You think of your spirit. Now let the spirit be strong and healthy, the body is unimportant. It is evident that after two years and half incessant travel the body becomes weak and subject to the attack of ailments. They offered their flowers and the Master kissed Mr. Herrigel and blessed having fervently. Then continued: He had the greatest of love for the believers in Germany. They were the cause of the happiness of his heart. Although he has not yet visited Stuttgard yet his heart felt the susceptibilities of the Stuttgard friends. In reality they were firm and assured Bahais. They were steadfast in the Covenant. God will confirm them. He told them last year and will repeat it this year that the Cause will be widely spread in Germany. After his return to the Orient, there will be a great awakening in Europe. When His Holiness the Bab declared his course, he would often state to his followers wait til the year nine, after his declaration. But after the martyrdom, the Bahais were scattered and discouraged. When the year nine came around and at a time, when were the name of the Bab was not mentioned and no one thought that the Cause will be rejuvenated suddenly this Holiness Baha-Ullah appeared and all the horizons were illumined! Now, Abdul Baha likewise told them wait till nine years after this date and they will observe with their own eyes the soared of the Cause in Germany.

{{p5}}

This being sudden many people started to arrive. The rooms were filled and a few were received in private by the Beloved. Mr. Bernard was asked by him to speak first and then he came out. Everybody arose and gave him a heartfelt welcome. He said: although his body was ill, his spirit was happy. His hope was for the illumination, the spiritual motion and rejuvenation of Paris. The world of materialism has enveloped these regions. People were submerged in this sea. He hoped that these fish who unbendingly survive in the ocean, may raise their heads out of the water and see the things which are in the outer world. He found the Parisians like these fish who were living in the sea of materialism. They were unaware that outside of the sea, there are many wonderful things. Although they are as fish he hoped that they may be changed into the birds and soar upward toward the immensity of this glorious space. Then they will behold nature in all its ravishing beauty. They will see the shining sun, the silver-beaming moon, the brilliant stars and all the infinite creations of God. This state will not be brought about except through the exertion of the Bahais.

{{p6}}

After the meeting the Master called Mr. Bernard to his room took his head into His Holy Breast, kissed his hairs and face: My son! My fine son! I will ever pray for you that day unto day you may become more inspired, day unto day you may become confirmed and day unto day you may become more illumined. Afterward we had our lunch. There were many Persians present. Madame D'Astre stayed to lunch with us and do some translating from French into English.

In the afternoon several Persian nobles came to see Our Beloved. Although his voice was very weak, yet, he spoke with them. at seven o'clock he called me into his room. After reading to him the daily news, Sayad Assamdullah came in apropos of something that the Master was telling he started to relate the interesting story of how he became a Bahai. The Master listened to him very attentively and enjoyed it, because it gave him a relief from speaking. It seemed that he had never told it to him although he has been serving him for lo!

Dear Harriet!

The Persians are very happy because our Beloved is feeling better. His long stay in Paris has made him restless. Every day he refers to his departure, that his world here is accomplished, that the time has cause for others to continue it. He has scattered divine seeds, now, he hopes, people will arise to water and cause this growth. He told Mr. and Mrs. Herrigel to return to Stuttgart and soon he will be in the midst.

{{p2}}

When this morning we presented ourselves in the Presence of Our Kingdom though his health was better, his voice was weal; he could hardly utter a word yet. Speaking almost in whisper he said: "Last night a curious thing happened. Long after midnight he got out of his bed and was on the point of calling Sayad Assadullah when suddenly he heard him say "Bab Aga"-yes Master.  He thought it was very strange that he answered before he was called so he waited for him coming. No! He had not come. Abdul Baha was going to call him again when he heard, "Bab Aga". He said to himself this time he will surely come. No, there was no sign of Sayad Assadullah! By this time he was amused and started to The third and the fourth time he was going to call him and the answer was heard before he opened his mouth. Finally, he did not come. It seemed that Sayad Assadullah was dreaming and the repeated answers of "Bab Aga" uttered where in a dream state."

Everyone was amused and laughed more than anybody Sayad Assadullah himself. This story showed the love of the old man for the Master, that even in his dream he was answering his call and hold conversation with him. Such love, sincerity and unselfish service are rare! One cannot see these qualities exemplified in the lives of everyone. I may claim that I love Abdul Baha that I adore the Cause that I will give up everything for the sake of the Movement. Well, after all, these are mere claims. Are they not? But if I kept the same forth, the same smiling happiness after two years in prison-life, after many years of persecutions and sufferings as Sayad Assamulah, then my claims are proven. Nowadays, the smallest difficulty easily upset us. Don't they? What a contrast with those who keep calm and undisturbed under severe tests and ordeals!

{{p3}}

The Master continued to speak, relating several stories of the life of Baha-Ullah and the early Bahais who were after severely persecuted and who at times felt discouraged but praise be to god, today the cause was spread all over the earth and the standard was upraised. A most prominent man from London wrote to Abdul Baha, "That although I am a Mohamadan, i went to serve the Bahai Cause. When I say I saw a Mohamadan, it is not because I am proud to be one but I want to show you that I am honest to show you that I have no ulterior purpose. Because it is well-known that today a people that is looked down by all the nations is the Mohamadans and the most honored and beloved of all the {{p4}} people are the Bahais." Then the Master went on saying: "I have by day and by night until the Cause has reached to such a degree of glory! All the enemies are humbled. All the leaders of Persia acknowledge the greatness of Baha-Ullah. They have realized that this Cause is today conducive to the glory of Persia and they are proved and pleased.


What a contrast this is with the persecutions of the past. Baha-Ullah at his follower were exiled from Constantinopole and were on their way to Smyrna, the Persian Consul with his servant were on that steamer. All the way long whenever the Consul's servant looked at the Bahais he would point then to the passengers with the finger of scorn, saying, "these people were a disgrace to Persia, they caused the degradation on Persia before all the nations of the world." When the Bahais arrived in Smyrna, as they were passing through the Bagoas, everybody would jeer and taunt them as the "Jews of Persia". Like unto the Jews, they would say they are scattered on the face of the earth, because {{p7}} of their heresies and iniquities.

{{p5}}

Mr. Crewe of Newfoundland came and had a very spiritual interview. I will always remember thee and I will pray in thy behalf. The Master told him as he kept his head on his breast and kissed his face and his hair several times. He was deeply moved by this manifestation of divine love. Although his voice was weak, yet he dictated for him a most beautiful supplication. I give you herein a translation: O Thou Kind God! We are Thy humble servants, endear us in Thy kingdom. We are poor, enrich us through Thy heavenly Treasury! We are ignorant, suffer us to become informed with Thy Mysteries.

We are dead, quicker us with the Breathes of Thy Holy Spirit. We are extinct, enkindle us with the Fire of Thy Love, O God! Do not look upon our capabilities, but deal with us in accord with Thy infinite Mercy! O Lord! Cause the drop to become an oceans and the seed the harvest!

Verily Thou art the Giver, the Generous and the Mighty!

Dear Harriet!

This is a great day in America! The eyes of the world is centered on that country. You are inaugurating a new President in Washington. The French and English Press praise the character and sincerity of Doctor Wilson. He is entering in his office with the good will of the civilized world. While in America, the Master often praised the sterling quality of the new President and thought he will steer the ship of state safely through the national storm and hurricane. He assures that he will have a wise and progressive administration.

{{p2}}

We had a quiet day. In the morning we drunk tea with the Master. He said: The more we thank Baha-Ullah for these bounties with which He has encircled us, the more numerous will they become. When Baha-Ullah in the early history of the Cause desired to test anyone, he would say something contrary to his established opinion. When he was in the plain of Badasht, there was a man who was very religious and prayed for hours. Baha-Ullah in order to break this factual habit of excessive praying ordered Korra-ul-Ajul to upbraid him. While the man was engaged in prayer, she entered the tent and before to address him in the most vehemently language that this was the day of work, the hour of action. Get up and do something. This was not the day of prayer.

The man was so overwhelmed at this sudden attack that he trembled and sat down weeping. He left the tent without saying a word but he returned tomorrow with a cheerful face. He was ready for action. In those days the tests were so terrific that out of three hundred and fifty believers only a handful remained but later they all came back and joined the lead!

{{p3}}

Mr. an Mrs. Herrigel came to say goodbye to the Master. He told them that he loved you very much, that if one flame of the fire of his love was infinite in their hearts, they would be set a glow, and they would illumine all the hearts . The German believers must become the foundation of the Bahai Cause in that country. If the foundation was strong the building would stand up for generation. 

One of the Persian Bahais from Rasht by the name of Sayad Ahmad Bageroff arrived and was introduced into the presence of the Master. After that the Master received various visitors from England.

{{p4}}

He came out at noon and delivered a short address full of love and sympathy. I may give it here: You are most welcome. I have been sick for the last few days but I am always pleased to meet you. I beg from the favors of God to illumine each one of you with the rays of His love, suffer you to enter in His Kingdom and make you favored at His Threshold. For the Graces of God are unlimited and this world is very dark. The material world has gained the upper hand and the ideals of life are forgotten. There is no divine Illumination. The material world is animalistic, it is not human. The human world must become spiritual and if these spiritual susceptibilities are not realized it would be lower than the burial.

Therefore, for you desire the spiritual state, the ideal progress and the entrance into the Kingdom of Abha. may you ascend to such a world that you may behold all the creations beneath you! May you behold such light that is eternal! May you be assisted with such power that is never ending . May you obtain such a life which is everlasting!

In the afternoon he dictated a few Tablets and for the first time in the last few days, he went out with Mon. Dreyfus to breathe in the fresh air. On his return he spent nearly two hours walking in the salon in deep thought and reflection!

He partook of his dinner very early and retired to his room.

My Bahai love to all.

Dear Harriet!

This morning our Beloved felt better and his voice was clear and resonant. We drank tea in His Presence and Mirza Mahmood chanted a prayer. It was a very quiet hour. I was sent out to call on two persons and when I returned I saw people waiting to receive private interviews and be refreshed with the Breezes of divine Spirit. Meanwhile I dictated to Miss Dorothy Hodgson the translation of an address of the Master given sometimes ago, proving the existence of God. It was time for him to come out.

{{p2}}

His address was short and to the point: "You are very welcomed. I am always glad to meet you and associate with you. But the weather of Paris did not agree with me and caused me this illness. Therefore today I cannot speak too long but my ideal tongue will converse with you and my heart will hold communion with you and my spirit will talk with you. Without the instrumentality of lips I explain to you the Mysteries of the Kingdom. Whosoever has a listening ear he shall hear my voice. For by day and by night, my call is "Ya Baha El Abha", summoning the people to the Kingdom of Abha. The Knowing hearts comprehend these significances. The souls who turn their faces toward God will behold the lights of the {{p3}} Kingdom of Baha-Ullah. But if they are not attentive all that they have will yield no result. It will be like playing violin to a deaf. 

Praise be to God that your hearts are informed, your ears are unstopped and your souls turned toward the Kingdom of Abha. I hope that you will hear always my voice and comprehend the glorification of His Holiness Baha-Ullah. In this world of existence I have no other work except to raise the name of Baha-Ullah, proclaim the Kingdom of Baha-Ullah and explain the Mysteries of the Book of Baha-Ullah. Therefore I hope the sweet stories of this music will have an abiding effect in your hearts."

Today he ate with us at the table and the Persians were made happy.

{{p3}}

At three o'clock Mrs. Bernard, Mrs. Richard and Miss Sanderson came to see the Master. he told them that he has already stayed too long in Paris, that daily he has sown the seeds of the word of God and he hoped that they shall arise to irrigate this divine form. They must have meetings, the doors of which must be open to all and they must study carefully the writings of Baha-Ullah.

In the books of Baha-Ullah one finds the solution of every problems. For instance the Hidden Words contrasts the moral precepts and spiritual advices; the "Seven Valleys" is for the mystic advancement of the spirit through successive unfoldment; the Book of Al Idrus is for the application of civic laws and government; the Tarazat and Tajalleyat are divine ordinances for the economic and social progress of the nation. Likewise there are Tablets on Philosophy, metaphysic, etc. Every person more or less was interested in one or the other school of Thought, and he would find the principles of that school, highly developed in the Bahai Revelation.

The Master expressed the hope that after his departure they will arise to render greater services and show moral, spiritual enthusiasm.

{{p4}}

At five o'clock the Master with Mon. Dreyfus and myself drove in the Bois de Boulogne. It was a very lonely afternoon. While the automobile was driving by, I saw so many pretty lakes, cascade. falls, green lawns etc. During the spring months the Bois must be an earthly paradise. On our return the Master called on the Persian Ambassador and there he met by an special arrangement the first man of Persia, the Regent, Naser-ul-Mulk.

An hour and half was  spent in various conversations. It was a most significant moment to see the master with the virtual King of Persia. Because Naser-ul-Mulk during the minority of Ahmad Shab is really the King of Persia. On our return I jotted down all that i could remember of the conversation which will be a valuable document for the future.

I read today to the Master the inaugural address of President Wilson in New York Herald, Paris Edition. He thought it was  sound and very excellent. It contained great ideas born from a sincere heart.

Dear Harriet!

The Beloved's health is daily improving and the morning was spent in private interview. About ten o'clock he called to his room Aga Faraj and gave him a Tablet written with his own hand. In one of his poems he had ingeniously request Abdul Baha to reveal for him a Tablet. To his honor Aga Faraj, upon him be Baha-Allah. El Abba! He is the True One!

His Honor Aga Faraj like unto the wind swept across the deserts and like unto the birds soared over mountains and sea till he arrived in Paris. Here he become the companion and the intimate friend of Abdul Baha. O God! Protect this rare soul from the evil influence of the erring ones and grant unto him a shelter and asylum under the shade of the Blessed Tree. Engage his tongue in sweet melody like unto the thankful birds so that day and night he may spent his time in thy glorification and praise! Abdul Baha Abba.

In the afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Wilkins, relatives of Mrs. Agnes Parsons of Washington DC called on the Master and had a pleasant interview. Mr. Wilkins told him how the French government had set itself against any religious movement, notably the Catholics. The authorities have taken out the name of God out of all the teach-books studied by the children in the public schools. The government has also spies everywhere to find out whether any of the officials are Catholics. If a Catholic is in the service of the Republic, he cannot go to the church. The Master deplored these radical measures and said if such is the case the future of the French Republic is fraught with great danger. It cannot stand on such atheistic foundation. In America, people are religious, they are attracted, they are investigating, they are open-minded, they praise God. You find them many spiritual people. The name of Mrs. Parsons was mentioned by the Master with great affection. On their departure the Beloved gave to each a tangerine.

At six o'clock <unreadable> called on the Master and spent more than an hour in his presence.

This morning I travelled the beautiful talk of the Master on Individuality, Personality and character.

In the afternoon I prepared many packages of the International Psychic Gazette containing the reading of the hand of the Master to be sent to the Orient and America.

I enclose herein another heavenly talk of the Master given in London.

The Beloved took his dinner at the table about half past eight and retired to his room.

For the last few days i caught a cold and have not been feeling well.

Dear Harriet!

This was a lovely day. The Master was in his best mood of storytelling, one often another, sparkling with humour, laughter and the joy of living. He is really an incarnation of happiness under the most adverse circumstances and a master over all the situations. In his hand he carries the key of human heart and is alone able to open it showing us the beauties of holiness. The most remarkable thing about his stories is that he invariably tells them to illustrate a particular point while discussing a profound subject; and unless one is able to {{p2}} connect them with those topics they are after to of their beauty and charm.

This morning he spoke about the material atmosphere of Paris and her complete captivation in the claws of physical senses. He has often dwelt on this phase of the good Paris. It seems to him that their eyes are shut and they are trying to see the light. He thinks that his second trip and long story in Paris has not yielded as much the same results as his tour of America, England and Scotland. This worry, I personally believe in the main cause of his indisposition. There have been many meetings and {{p3}} much interest has been shown, but that I am speaking in comparison. Of course from a spiritual standpoint, wherever the Master stays for a short or a long time, the moral forces will be set to work and if we cannot see immediate results, there will be great harvests in the future. Of this fact we are all sure for his Teachings are like unto the pure seeds. Sometimes the seeds are fallen in a pure soil and with the attention and training of the gardener the moderation of climate, they will soon grow. At a few times, the weather bring cold, the time for the germination of the seed will be slow. The future {{p4}} of Paris will be brilliant even if its present horizon is gloomy. If the people only knew who was staying amongst them, who was walking in their streets, they would have soared with joy and felicity. Is not this the day foretold by all the prophets? Is not this the fulfilment of all the heavenly predictions? Is not this the period in which the "Branch" mentioned in the old Testament has upraised the Banner of Universal Peace? Are not the clear fountains of life flowing? Is not the Desire of all the nations living amongst us with the simplicity of the servant and the majestic and grandeur of the Almighty? {{p5}} Has he not dedicated his whole life to our welfare and happiness? Has not the light of his Countenance illumined the East and the West? Has he not showered his infinite love and tenderness upon all the human race? Has he not chosen the American friends to render a most noteworthy service to the world of humanity? Did he not herald the coming of the Kingdom of God from one end of America to another? Is he not expecting to hear everyday good and wonderful news from the land of the free and the brave? Is he not listening? Is he not watching? Then why should we sleep upon the {{p6}} coach of negligence? Why should we let go but of our hands these divine blessings? Why should we not work as he wants to work? Why should we remain inadvertent? Why should we be satisfied with small issues, with little things? This is the day in which we must work together with the main and force for the oneness of the world of humanity for the brotherhood of all the religions, for the solidarity of all the races, for the spiritualization of all the nations, for amity and friendship, for the promotion of universal conciliation, for the attraction of the hearts with the fire of the Love of God, for the enlightenment of the minds with the {{p7}} rays of the sun of Reality and for the final, writing orchestral melody - the federation of man. To serve for any other cause except the promotion of these inspiring ideals will be loss of time and energy. Before these sublime strains all the minor notes must be forgotten. When we have listened to the heavenly Music of the divine Artist, we will not stop in the streets to listen to the street hurdy-gurdy. When we appreciate the value of the wonderful, universal Teachings of Baha-o-llah, we will not for one moment consider as worth our time and consideration petty difference or any ill-feeling. We will be banded together {{p8}} like the unbreakable links of light and work in common for what the Beloved says the promulgation of the heavenly civilization. He is calling to us day and night! Let us not fail him. Let us do, not only our duty but more than this, let us do his duty. With resonant voice, with clear melody, with heavenly sweetness, he is constantly inviting and encouraging us to become the standard-bearers of the Unity of the world of man, the heralds of the Kingdom of Abha, the spreaders of universal Peace, the Servants of our fellowmen, the enlighteners of the dark hearts, the guides of the erring ones and Kind to all the people of the world.

After meeting in his own room a number of seekers he came out at noon and delivered a short and impressive talk: You are welcome! I constantly pray for you and beg for each divine Confirmations, so that the eyes of your insight may be opened to see those objects which are not seen by others, to feel those susceptibilities which are not felt by others, to be reinforced by the invisible powers, to become cognizant of the worlds of God, because the divine worlds are infinite. Any soul who is deprived of the Graces of the worlds of God will remain portion less. He is like unto a child who does not possess objective, the irradiation of the intellect. He is like unto a piece of stone which is devoid of any human sensibilities. How pitiful is the condition of that soul who is uninformed with the Graces of the worlds of God. {{p10}} Therefore I entreat and supplicate toward God to open the eyes of your insight so they you may behold the effulgence's of the divine worlds, to be informed with the Mysteries of the Kingdom, to attain to the highest degree of perfection, to take a portion and a share from the waves of the Sea of the Bounties of Baha-o-llah which is set in motion and has encircled the East and the West. But a thousand times, alas that the eyes are blind and the ears are deaf and the intellects are weak. Then they are deprived of these heavenly inexhaustible Graces. But I have destined this lofty station for you; therefore I counsel you to turn your faces toward the Kingdom {{p11}} of Abha, think of God and become informed with the mysteries of the Kingdom.

Just before going out two Indians had an interview with him. With them there was a young man from New York. The Master wreathed with smile as these three entered his room, hand in hand. He told them that he was most happy to meet them. He was very pleased to see the orient and the occident, hand in hand. They must strive day and night so that political religion and national prejudices be wiped away and all the people may live harmoniously under the all-protecting Tent of the Almighty! What a great bounty was this! What a great Favour {{p12}} was this! He hoped that through their effort this object will be obtained. The Bounties of God are abundant and His Favours are infinite but they are only obtainable through the realization of the oneness of the world of humanity. The doors of the kingdom are opened. The coherts of the Supreme Concourse are descending and they are confirming all those who have arisen the serve. Ere long divine Illumination shall encompass all religions. This age is a new age and it's period is a new period. 

In the afternoon several important Persians arrived and the talk of the Beloved was coruscating with wit and humour, telling one story after another. Really I have seldom enjoyed such a delicious afternoon! 

{{p15}}

It was Mirza Ali Akbar Rafsanjani to whom the Master had sent a telegram to return from Luzanne (Switzerland). Well of course I was very hae came back after staying there 24 days. He has been very successful in teaching the souls and speaking at various gatherings.

Dear Harriet!

The Persian New Year is approaching and I believe we may spend either in Paris or in Stuttgart. When we arrived in Paris on the 21st of January I never thought that the Beloved will stay here so long. However there must be a wisdom in this which will appear later. This morning he read some letters from California and dictates answers. When I presented to him the translation of the petition from one of the maid-servants in San Francisco his face became radiant, hopeful and smiling. Truly I say, he said. She is a real Bahai. See how the holy sanctified souls unconsciously express their sincerity and faithfulness in every word they utter or write! He began to read the letter. When he {{p2}} finished it he said: While in America I strove day and night to prepare a few holy sanctified souls to take up the burden of the Cause after my departure. A very few who have responded to this call have arisen to serve and teach. As they were capable souls they forged ahead and advanced without much coercion on my part. In the middle of the nights I constantly pray for them and beg of God to descend upon them His heavenly benediction! May they succeed in their noble task!

He asked me what was the subject of last night's meeting. I gave him an outline of the proceeding and then told him that someone in the audience inquired about the difference between Sufism and the Bahai Movement. The Master stated that he had explained the philosophical aspect of this subject. It is this: In Sufism there are only two stations; God and his creatures. In turn, the creatures are not only considered as {{p3}} God's emanations but they are parts of the essence of God. In other words with a slight interpretive variations pantheism is the basis upon which the Sufi philosophy is built. The Sufis likened the essence of God into a sea and the creatures are the waves of the sea. In a wave you find all the potential attributes of sea. The individual members of the world of humanity are therefore distinct waves which are temporarily cut off from the sea. They are parts of the sea. One day they will join the sea and partake of all its infinite attributes. However, in the Bahai Cause there are three stations. The Station of Divinity, the Station of the Will and the station of creatures. The phenomena proceed from the Will of the Almighty. They do not form parts {{p4}} of the essence of God. They are the creation of His Will.

Further he said: It is not through the philosophical interpretation of this or that subject that the souls are attracted to the Kingdom of Abha. Philosophy withers the spirit. We must stir the souls by proclaiming boldly the "Glad-tidings" of the Kingdom so that the souls may become cheered and breathe the fresh zephyr, wafting from the Paradise of Joy. We must intoxicate the people with the Wine of the Love of God. We must say: O ye people! do ye Know in what radiant day you are living? Do you realize in what peerless age you are existing? Awake! Awake! This is the century of Our Glorious Lord! Be mindful! Be mindful! This is the period of the King of Kings! Arise! Arise! This is the Dispensation of the Light of lights! {{p5}} Be active! Be active! This is the sovereign of all ages! Be illumined! Be illumined! The lights of the Sun of Reality are pouring down! Sleep! Why are ye sleep! Negligent! Why are ye negligent! In this age the prophecies of all the holy Books are fulfilled! The desire of all the nations hath come! Hasten ye! Hasten ye! Gather around his hammer! Sing the songs of triumph! Raise your rich melodious voices toward the Supreme Concourse! All the prophets of the past have longed for this Day! This day is yours! The doors of opportunities are opened before your face. Be stirred with the Glad-tidings of Abha! Shake away this slumber! Serve your God! Spread to all parts His Glorious Message! Be inspired with his wondrous revelations! Let your voices be heard by all {{p6}} the nations of the world. Be ye filled with the joy of the Kingdom! Listen to the voice of the Shepherd. Is he not calling his flock to gather around him? He is tender! He is loving. He is merciful! He is compassionate! I wish you were here to see the emotions played on the Master's face as he delivered the above pronouncement. Now powerful, again commanding, now sympathetic and again smiling! If a photographer was hidden somewhere behind the door and could take a series of snapshots of the rapid changes which felted across his majestic countenance which swayed by the spiritual feelings of the heavenly words we would have had an excellent heritage for posterity! I was simply transfixed with wonder, awe and amazement! A torrent of words flowed from his lips! When I came out I was intoxicated and could remember out the sight of a few drops from the {{p7}} sea of divine ulterano which was set in motion by the invisible gales and hurricanes the directions of which I could not guess!

Mirza Ali Akbar told the Master about his work in Luzanne and the interest shown by the people of Switzerland in the Bahai Teachings. He must have had a wonderful time! He is a good teacher and speaker. 

The Master went out, calling me to follow him. It was very cold, so he stopped at Miss Sanderson's home to inquire about {{p8}} her mother's condition. In the course of conversation he said: Wherever we have gone people became attracted to the Cause and we were warmed but here in Paris there is not much interest and consequently we are getting cold. He spoke about the weather in Haifa and how with a few thousand frones one can build a lovely summer cottage on Mount Carmel. Miss Sanderson become interested in the idea of a delightful chalet on the slope of the Mountain of God, overlooking the blue Mediterreanean and all the surrounding hills. Leaving Miss Sanderson we walk toward the Trocadero. It was a sunny day and we approached Napoleon's Bridge. He sat on a chair. The children, many of them {{p9}} dressed in white and all clean and beautiful roaming in the Park were attracted to the Master. How I love these children! he exclaimed, from the Orient the children are not kept so clean by their mothers and thus often leads to severe sicknesses.

He returned home, ready to receive the friends. There were many present and the new ones were cheered by his divine words. His talk was on the wisdom of His sickness. He said in part: There is a great wisdom in my illness. It will become apparent cater. For two years and half I have been travelling around but was never attacked with such severe illness. I am under {{p10}} the Central of God; I am not governed by the dictates of nature. It is not that nature has conquered me, I have conquered nature a long time ago. I am the ruler over nature. I am under the control of God. That which is in accord with the wisdom of the Almighty that happens to me. It has been so from the beginnings of my life. While in Teheran I was seven years old. I become afflicted with consumption. All the physicians gave me up. The wisdom of this became apparent later on; because were I not sick I would not have remained in Teheran. I would have gone to Nour in Mazanderan. I could not be in Teheran where the Blessed Perfection was thrown into the prison. On account of that sickness I was kept in Teheran and later in company with Baha-o-llah I was exiled to Bagdad. When all the physicians said, that this fragile body is beyond the stage of recovery I suddenly got well. There was at the time an English physician in Teheran who pronounced my case as hopeless. All the physicians were amazed at my sudden recovery. They could not believe that I have got completely well. Therefore all the events of my life are shaped by divine hand and based upon heavenly wisdom. I am ever controlled by the will of God. He shook hand with everyone and went out with Mon. Dreyfus. On his return we all had lunch in his presence. After his rest {{p12}} he read letters just arrived from the Orient.

About nine o'clock, he ordered an automobile and he took me with himself to call on Moneer Pasha, the former Ambassador of Turkey in Paris who lives at 22 Rue de La Tremoille. He was a wide awake man, well informed. His wife was a charming Turkish Lady who had called several times on the Master. They were beside themselves with joy. Both kissed the Beloved's hands. For two hours he stayed there talking on many {{p13}} subjects which were interest to them. Both were very insistent that the Master should take a trip to Constantinople because his broad Teachings were much needed by the inhabitants of the near East.

Dear Harriet!

What will you give me if by quoting a few words from the lips of the Beloved, the American friends would soar in the atmosphere of joy with the wings of light? I let his own words sing and dance their happy meanings into your heart: "As regards the second trip of Abdul Baha to America. If the believers become enkindled and attracted in a superlative degree, perhaps this aim will be again obtained. Capability and ability are the magnetic powers." Is not this the most wonderful glad-tidings? The most intoxicating wine? The happiest promise? Can you dream of the glorious possibilities of another trip of the Beloved of our hearts? The King of Kings {{p2}} riding on the Clouds of Majesty. Will not this glowing promise give you greater strength to spread his message? to herald the news of brotherhood? to work harder for the Cause? to teach with more enthusiasm? to promote the ideas of international peace? to enlarge the sphere of your activities? to affiliate with all the children of men and to unfurl the standard of the oneness of the world of humanity? Let all the minor issues, petty ideas and personal preferences be cast into the corner of oblivion and let the brilliant star of hope ever shine before our vision! Let everyone arise and clean first his own home, prepare the way according to his or her capacity; for the Lord of mankind will come one way or another. Let us create the day and night the "magnetic powers" {{p3}} of which Abdul Baha speaks. What are these "magnetic powers"? Do you know what are they? They are the promotion of the principles of the Bahai revelation. Let not this spiritual opportunity slip out of our hands. Let us set to work now. Let us introduce the Cause into those cities that have not been blessed by the Beloved. The great Southern States were deprived of his Presence. If he ever comes for the second time, the "magnetic powers" must attract him. This is the time for work, again work and again work. Work and pray unceasingly till you find again the Beloved in your midst. The labourer is worthy of his hire. From one end of America to another {{p4}} the believers must marshal their forces, bring into active play their hidden energies and awaken the souls to the mighty importance of this fact. America has been already wonderfully blessed with the Gifts of God. The Breeze of God hath blown over its lands; the voice of the Lord of Hosts hath been raised from the dome of its churches and temples; the music of heaven hath been listened to buy the prepared souls, the angel of light hath manifested himself in vast congregations; the temple of the herald of the Kingdom hath been sounded; the parched ground hath been watered; the wild jungle changed into fruitful orchards; the thorny places transformed into fragment rose-garden; hatred into love, strangeness into amity, satanic suggestions into divine attributes; {{p5}} frigidity into flexibility and carnal desires into spiritual susceptibilities. Were we open our eyes, we would see that every day the Master while in America, not only performed one but many miracles. What glorious prospect to have him again amongst the open-minded, truth-loving people of America? King wide the doors of your hearts. Send away the stranger and let the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings come in and take possession of his throne. It is in our hand to attract the Beloved to that country. My hope is that all my friends and sympathizers will do their utmost in the greatest spirit of harmony and accord. Is there anything on the face of the earth that we are not willing to sacrifice so that we may receive the benediction of another {{p6}} visit from one whom we love and obey?

This was a beautiful day. Being Sunday many more could attend the meeting and the rooms were filled with Orientals and Europeans who mixed with each other with the greatest of joy and happiness. Two Persian Bahais from Hamadan arrived last night and added their gentle and quiet presence to the meeting. A Persian woman who has been in Paris for the last three months was also here. It was a union of the East and the West. You could not find another meeting anywhere similar to a Bahai meeting especially when our Beloved delivers to us his counsels and admonitions. All morning he received Persians, Syrians, Americans, {{p7}} English, Frenchs, Arabs, Indians etc. For each he had a word of wisdom and light adapted to his comprehension. I could feel the spirit of love and affection from those who come out from his room with radiant faces and happy expressions.

His address this noon was a prayer for the Parisians. He opened his remarks by saying that, although it was the friends who should inquire after his health he asked, how are they feeling? Although he was not meeting them as he would have liked yet he was ever engaged in their commemoration. In the middle of nights he supplicated and prayed for each and all and exenterating at the throne of the Almighty he uttered this prayers: This Paris is {{p8}} a lamp in the utmost transparency but it is in need of the light. It is a body in the greatest of comeliness but it is in need of the spirit. O God! Illumine this lamp. And confer life upon this body! It is a pity that Paris be deprived of Thy eternal Bestowals! It is a pity that a great city like unto this be prevented from obtaining the splendours of the Sun of Thy Mercy! O God! Awaken these souls! Make them mindful! Perfume their nostrils with the sweet fragrances of Thy spiritual rose-garden! Enlighten their eyes by the shafts of light which are streaming down from the Central Sun of Thy Majesty in order that their hearts may become as polished mirrors {{p9}} reflecting the rays of the Sun of Reality. O God! We are weak and Thou art Powerful! We are needy but Thou art Independent and the Most High! Although we have no ability and capacity, yet Thy Infinite Bounty is inexhaustible! Do Thou not look upon our deeds! Deal with us through Thy Mercy and Forgiveness! If Thy Bestowals descend, the ignorant will become wise, the dead will be quickened, the deaf will become hearing and the blind shall see. But if Thy Bounties are not forth coming, the seeing ones are blinded. If the light of Thy guidance is not vouch safe, the wise will become ignorant. O God! We are all sick and Thou art the Kind Physician! Heal our {{p10}} spiritual diseases! Lead us toward the road of Thy Kingdom! Deliver us from the vices of the world of nature and adorn our beings with the virtues of Thy Kingdom. O God! Verily Thou art the Kind! O God! Thou art the Forgiver! the Pardoner! O God! Thou art the Generous! and the Giver! This is my prayer in the middle of nights and I ever lay for you divine Confirmation and assistance!

In the afternoon Prof. E.G. Brown and his wife called on the Master. They have come from London to stay two or three days. Prof. Brown stayed for nearly 3 hours. The Master after talking with him in the general reception room took him in his private room and there the conversation {{p11}} was a private nature. When he came out he was very happy. I am sure he will be a different man after receiving so much the love and kindness of the Beloved. In the evening while the Beloved was lying in his bed he dictated a most inspiring article for the Asiatic Quarterly Review which will appear in its April number. The colored photograph of the Master has been out for two or three weeks but the price is 5 dollars each. For the present I am not able to buy one but I hope I will be able to do it later.

Dear Harriet!

Are you not very happy? My heart sings the songs of praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord, because He has caused us to hear His voice; He has opened our eyes to see this glory and He has unlocked our ears. When I think of the possibility of another trip by the Beloved to America, I am overwhelmed with His infinite Bounty, but at the same time I think of the great amount of work that the friends must accomplish before sails for land. Anything is made possible if intelligent corporation is realized amongst all the friends. {{p2}} I feel arrangements must be made so that our abba Bahai speakers may deliver addresses just as the Master did before churches, societies and clubs along the lines of Abdul Baha's talks. Before secret public gatherings all dogmatic assertions must be avoided and simply the exposition of the Bahai principles suitable to the occasion be asserted. The circle of the Cause must constantly be widened and all the walls and barriers removed so that humanity may enter under the all-protecting Tent of Baha-o-llah and the Center of the Covenant. Let us make one of the principles of Baha-o-llah the dominant note of {{p3}} our lives that religion must be the cause of love and amity; religion creates hatred and animosity then irreligion is better than religion. This principle is strong enough to avoid all the means of differences. Is it not? Well, the first step is to hold fast to that which is conducive to love and amity. The most important thing just at present is to widen and widen the circle of the Bahai Cause. How are we going to do it? By following in the footsteps of the Master. He did not antagonize any sect or religion. Did he? Our work is the work of Construction and regeneration and to this ideal we have dedicated our fortunes, our possessions and our lives. Let our watchword be, Forward, O ye heavenly army! The victory is ahead of you.

This morning the Master was up early. At half-past six he was sitting near the window, the Persians were standing around, Sayad Assadollah was dispensing the tea and Mirza Ali Akbar Rafsanjani was chanting in musical tones the prayers of Baha-o-llah. The Master turned his face to Sayad Ahmad of Rasht and half-inquiring, half speaking said: The conditions of the Bahais in Rasht are good! Are they not? The believers have arisen to teach the souls. Is this not so? From Rasht in this days good news are being received. Today whosoever has arisen to teach the Cause and serve the believers, divine Confirmations {{p5}} shall discard upon him; otherwise, he is wasting his time. When he left Haifa two years and half ago, he was so weak that he could not walk 20 yards and his system was attacked by three kinds of illnesses, but praise unto God Confirmations reached us wherever we went. But in Paris he does not see an extraordinary exhilaration. It is like unto a lazy animal. All the beating in the world will not make him get up; even if you run a needle in his feet he will not get up. However, God will make him move. If not now, later on. There is no other way.

Mirza Ali Akbar told one of his experiences in Luzanne, which to my mind may be applied to many parts of {{p6}} Western world with equal accuracy. I used to go everyday to a grocery store to buy things. There was a young woman who expressed a great deal of interest in me, because I was dressed differently from the rest. She asked my history and instead I told her the history of the Cause with the few French words that I could command. Then I told her I have a little book that if she was really interested she could study the subject further. "Oh yes! Of course I am! Please bring the book next time." She enthusiastically answered. Next day I took to her the little book and she said in pulsively comment! "Je suis deverue Bahai". Before giving her the book I took notice of the fact that the pages were not yet cut. Several days passed and every day she would say in answer to my {{p7}} inquiry, "Yes I am reading it! It is most interesting." At last I told her that if she has finished it she could bring it to me and I will give her another. "All right! I finished it just last night" she said. When she brought me the book and I looked at the pages, I saw they were not yet cut.

I said that Madame Astre was here yesterday and told us that while she was speaking before the spiritual Alliance on the Bahai Cause, they hated her because she quoted Baha Wollah words that there is no glory in loving's one country, there is rather glory in this that one loves his kind; they were not interested in universal patriotism. They wanted to love their own country better than {{p8}} all the rest of the world.

The Master said: These objectives are always raised against the truth but the truth will march towards its ultimate goal of triumph. When the Bahais were exiled from Teheran to Bagdad they could not find one single Bahai on the way to Bagdad but see now how many Bahais are in each one of those cities! When Sultan Mohamad II , the Victor of Constantinople besieged the city and his army was constantly commanding the walls and the fortresses, one of the Greek generals entered into a cloister and saw a monk busy writing. He asked him, what are you doing? He said, I am writing a refutation against the religion of Mohamad. The general got {{p9}} furious and kicked the monk out of his cloister. "Get out of here, you idiot! When the banner of Mohamad was waving in Arabia, then it was the time to write a book against his religion but now that the noise of his cannons are booming behind our walls and fortifications what good will thy book achieve?" Now the Bahai Cause has gone too far, the principles are spread too widely, for the object are wasting their life.

He returned to his room to dictate Tablets for the friends of the East and the West. The friends began to arrive and many of them had long interviews. At noon he came out feeling {{p10}} well and happy. Today I feel much much better, he said. Then he spoke with great power and animation on the Glad-tidings of the Kingdom. The afternoon and evening was spent in quiet talk with the Persians and the callers. About 4 o'clock he went out with Mohamad Khan and the Persians went to Mr. Scott's studio meeting. I stayed home writing. When the Master returned he called me to his room and asked me to rub his feet, because he was tired walking for more than an hour. {{p11}} A clipping from New York Herald, European Edition will tell you the interesting story of President Wilson and his cabinet tabooing all kinds of liquors and intoxicants from any state banquets. It is in confirmation of a quotation from the Master's Tablet recently sent out. It only shows how his words are creative. He says a thing and the President of a great Republic puts it in execution unconsciously.

With much Bahai love

Dear Harriet!

The day of our departure is in sight. The Master a few days ago cabled to Port Said to his daughter Rouha Khanom not leave for Paris but wait in Port Said until his arrival. Yesterday he cabled to twelve countries of the Orient that he was on the eve of his departure for the Holy Land. He has written to several friends that the Port of landing will be Port Said. All these are indications that ere long the Sun of the Covenant will shine from another horizon. Germany is destined to entertain the Beloved. The believers there are anxiously waiting to receive the King of Kings. They are very earnest, sincere Bahais. Already much literature is spread throughout the whole German Empire through the indefatigable zeal of Mr. Herrigel and his co-workers. Miss Alma Knoblock in the last year has been teaching the Cause in Leipzig and other cities. There are a number of friends scattered here and there who expect to go to Stuttgard and visit the Beloved.

{{p2}}

Tomorrow night Mon. and Madame Dreyfus have invited the Master and all the Persians-about- and some of the Paris believers to what I believe should be designated as a farewell Banquet; not as large as that of New York or Washington but interesting enough to be recorded as one of the events. A flashlight photograph will be taken. 

{{p3}}

Today the Master felt much better. His address  was on the subject of "Spiritual and Material Education". Both in the morning and the afternoon Aga Faraj and his poems played important part to entertain him and the Persian guests. He is a source of great joy to the heart of the Beloved. Although his poems have neither rhyme nor rhythm yet some of the lines contain lofty ideals.

{{p4}}

The other day when the two new Persians Bahais arrived, having never visited the West, before entering the apart, they insisted on taking off their shoes as a sign of politeness and veneration to the Beloved. They would never think to enter the apt of the "Lord of Mankind" with their shoes on. Why, this was impossible and their eyes and facial expressions conveyed the ideas. I have no doubt they looked at the rest of us a lot of savage Hottentots. There was no use arguing with them, so they started to take their shoes off when the French maid arrived on the scene. She did not know what was going on and began to laugh! When someone told her of the difficulty, she cried out! "Why! This cannot be! Someone may come and carry them away! Then what are they going to do?"

Dear Harriet!

In the Presence of Our Beloved every one must feel very happy. N'est pas? He is the spring from which flows the never-failing, water of joy. His happiness is contagious, his mirth is creative; his smile is a delight to the hearts. His peaceful countenance inspires the souls with new hope. His unshakable faith is an example to all men. His ineffable love for the creatures is incomparable. The sympathy of his nature, the tenderness of his heart, the whiteness of his soul, the simplicity of his life, the loftiness and immaculate purity of his ideals, the artistic appreciation of his spirit, the immensity of his patience, the divine vigor of his deeds, the majestic beauty of his words, the all-embracing attitude of his disposition, the {{p2}} magnitude of his forgiveness, the inconceivable measure of his foulerance, and the godlike holiness of his character are the unmistakable evidences that the characteristics of the divine Humanity are now embodied in the visible Temple of man, preparing the way for the day when the children of the human race will receive a larger portion from these attributes; when the surface of the hearts will become like unto clear mirrors reflecting therein the heavenly images of the Kingdom of Abha! That day will be the Sun of all the past days. That age will be the Sovereign of all the ages! The hidden virtues of the world of humanity will be revealed; the Flag of universal Peace unfurled, the Place of the Brotherhood will open wide its golden gates; the hosts of the Supreme Concourse will flood the whole {{p3}} world with the glory of the Lord, the King of the Kingdom; the Banquet of the Spiritual Fraternity will be spread, around which all the nations shall gather, singing the songs of joy, the rose-garden of humanity will be adorned with new multi-colored flowers; the trees of existence will be clad with verdant leaves, delicate blossoms and outstretching branches, yielding luscious fruits during all the seasons; the spiritual verities will become manifest and mankind in its entirety will be surrounded with the moving sea of heavenly bestowals and become illumined with the refulgent rays of the Sun of Reality. Then there will be no war and no contention. Peace will reign from one end of the world to the other and the inspiring song of good will turn all men raised from every tongue.

Today we all drink tea in the Presence of the Beloved. There are nearly twelve Persians who are constantly here from early morning to evenings. At 6:30 a.m. when they start ringing the bell and by 7 o'clock they are all present to be ushered into the Beloved's room. They drink tea and the Master either speaks or asks a few questions. Mirza Ali Akbar chants most beautifully supplications from the pen of Baha-Wollah. He continues chanting till the Master tells him "Very well", meaning it is enough. Then he leaves the Persians and goes to his own room to read and answer letters. About 9 or ten o'clock a piece of bread is taken to him for his breakfast. The people start to come and he receives each with {{p5}} that unfailing courtesy and smile which are the inherent qualities of this Master of Men. For the last few days Aga Faraj and his poems have taken much of the Master's time, both in the morning and afternoon. Every day he writes new lives ready for the morning and the Beloved jokes with him all the time. One of the Persians wanted to buy the manuscript of his poems for one hundred franes. He would not sell it for a thousand. He believes that these lives which are read to the Master will be of great value to his household; so he will take them back to Persia to be read in the spiritual assemblies. One day he told the Master that he had already dreamed last night that he was reading his poems in a large meeting in Teheran.

{{p6}}

Mr. and Mrs. Wilkins came this morning to visit the Master. They asked questions about Redemption and the Immortality of the Soul and he gave them by thy answers which apparently satisfied both of them. They are very intelligent and alive to the questions of the day. The Master said, because the French Catholic priests have taken always the side of Royalty and desired to have a Monarchy rather than a Republic, the government was suspicious of religion and had arisen to persecute them and debarring them from all the official positions. {{p7}} If these leaders of religions did not interfere with politics, they would not have been today in such a plight. He spoke briefly on the eradication of prejudices and dogmas from amongst all the religions and nations and showed how each religion believed that what it had was reality, while all the rest were counterfeits but the truth of the matter is that they are all holding fast to dogmas and have forgotten the reality which underlies all the religions.

After the talk he called me and Mirza Hossein, a Persian who has lived in Paris for fifteen years and loves the Master very much to go out and have a walk with him. We took a car and went toward Antevil. Alighting from the car {{p8}} at the end of the line we walked around the old rampart and fortification. I enjoyed the sight very much. The Master talked all the time about the abuses of freedom in Paris and jokingly beating Mirza Hossein with his stick. The poor man enjoyed the beating and said, it was a great honor to be beaten by Abdul Baha. 

In the afternoon the Master sent me to call on Mirza Mehdi Khan, the brother of the Regast of Persia who was the new Persian Minister to America. He lives in Astoria Hotel in Champs Elysee. I was thinking all this time that he had left for America but it seems he was here yet. {{p9}} On my return I found two Americans in the Presence of the Beloved. They had heard about the Cause four years ago in Washington. They were artist and for the last two years they have lived in Paris. They did not know any of the Bahais here, so the Master sent them with Doctor Mohamad Khan to meet Miss Sanderson. Afterward the Beloved called on Rashid Pasha who does not live very far from here. On his return I was summoned to his room and read some letters and cables just received.

The question of his departure from Paris was discussed and be intimated that in a few days he will depart for Stuttfort. He said that he must get a little stronger; that he did not have the tongue of complaint. {{p10}} His sickness a few days ago was very serious. One night he got out of his bed to turn the electric light; he was so weak that he fell on the floor and swooned. For a long time he was unconscious. Then when he came to himself, cold perspirations run all over his body. With the greatest of difficulty he arose and reached the bed. He went under the cover bed and was shaking with cold. Under such conditions he stayed in Paris, hoping that perchance the Fire of the Love of God will be ignited in the hearts; otherwise he had nothing {{p11}} to do in this city; if he was pursuing pleasures he could very easily go to Nice when the climate was most moderate. He lived for the Cause and not for his health. If he saw just now that his presence was needed in St. Petersburg or Siberia he would leave without delay; he would not wait one moment; he would not stop to think whether he was healthy or not. These consideration never came with the range of his thought.

At nine o'clock we all started for the Restaurant Petit Durand which was not far. The Master went in an auto with Mon. Dreyfus. Only the Persians were {{p12}} invited with Mon and Madame Dreyfus. There were about eighteen guests in all. The photographer was there but his flashlight did not work and so the photo could not be taken. Here is the menu (copy menu from card). It was about 10:30 that we returned home. Aga Faraj had written a poem for the occasion but it was decided to read it tomorrow morning as the Master was quite tired and wished to retire as soon as the dinner was over.

Dear Harriet!

It is five pm; I am sitting beside the Master; our car is driving in the Bais de Boulgene; crowd of pedestrians are walking on all sides; automobiles with their occupants dash rather and thothan; the fair trees are showing the signs of verdancy and tiny leaves push their heads forth; a gentle breeze is blowing; there is a silence; then I turn my head toward Abdul Baha saying: The American friends will become happy if they hear the news of your {{p2}} probable second visit to that country? He answered, we will go and meet the friends again, if they arise unitedly to spread the Cause and be exceedingly attracted and enkindled with the Fire of the Love of God. He looked around the Park, watching the trees with their faint green appearances and the gardeners preparing the flower-beds, to be transformed in a few days into a mass of luxurious colour and beauty. Then he turned to me and with one wave of his hand toward the open, I knew what he was going to say: Do you see these gardeners working faithfully all day here tilling the ground, sowing the seeds, watering and tenderly taking care of them? What is the result of {{p3}} all this labours? In a short while this bare, dark sail will be covered with thousand multi-coloured flowers, fair and beautiful as the Daven, perfuming the air with sweet and delicate fragrances! the gardeners, them will come and feast their eyes on scenes of ravishing beauty! That will be their highest reward! And their greatest happiness is to see the people appreciating and enjoying those flowery scenes! Now in America he has left behind many heavenly gardeners; he has given them the seeds of spiritual wisdom and Celestial Knowledge. These seeds must be sown, in prepared soil so that in case he returns he may not see a wild jungle but a rose-garden with hyacinths, anemones, nasturtium, rose and carnations, violets and tulips, jasmine's chrysanthemum and lilies of the valley. {{p4}} If all depends upon the effort of the gardeners. May they succeed! May they labour in this dark winter of materialism! May they put forth the highest effort! Actually he did not say a word of all that I have written here neither did he open his tongue. But in that one wave of hand I grasp the significance of his look. I hope all the friends will work with one accord so that the Divine Gardener may come and walk in the lovely rose-gardens that they have prepared for him.

This morning three celebrated Parisian physician came to the Master. They were one hour in his room with Mon. Dreyfus and prescribed a regime and medicine, I wonder whether he will follow their treatment.

There is a spiritual atmosphere in the morning gathering {{p6}} of the Persian Bahais in the Presence of the Beloved. They are all sitting around the room with the utmost dignity and politeness born of the ingrained idea that one is in the company of a Superior human being - a being who is the embodiment of spiritual perfections. And when Mirza Ali Akbar starts to chant with his musical voice the prayers of Baha Wollah there steals over one's spirit a calmness and a happiness which are not of this ethereal world.

The other day while a group of Persians were sitting and the Master was reading a letter an American lady came in. She looked all around; here we were all swarthy Orientals; I believed {{p7}} she was a little afraid but the Master welcomed her, bade her sit down and to talk with her. Before long she smiled; her apprehension was vanished and she felt as though she is sitting with her own leathers. She felt one with us. Such was the power of the Beloved. At 6 a.m. people started to come and each one in turn had an interview. About noon he came out and gave a short address on his approaching departure from Paris and the necessity of divine education. He said that he bows the friends in Paris as his own Souvenirs that they must be very attractive souvenirs {{p8}} and spread the message whenever opportunity is offered.

Mon. Dreyfus came and brought a cable from Port Said that, Rouha Obanour with Mirza Jalal and another lady have already sailed {{p9}} and will arrive in Morsuille about 18th. This will postpone the trip of the Beloved to Stuttfort for he was planning to depart on the 18th but now he will stay till they arrive.

At four the Master was motored to Astoria Hotel in Champs Elysee to call on Mirza Mehdi Khan, the Persian Minister to the United States. He stayed there for an hour. Tea was served in the beautiful salon. Much discussion was devoted to the striking differences between Western and Eastern civilization, the customs {{p10}} and manners prevalent in each country; also the status of the conditions of the Persian Students in Paris was touched. What the sons of Persia must learn in Europe are the sciences, engineering, arts, crafts, and medicines and not how to dance how to play with a cane, how to wear a collar or how to have the crease of the trousers undisturbed!

The Master was driven for two hours through Bologne. All the answers were illuminated; he was most of the time quiet and when he talked it was about the complete heedlessness of all these crowds who were immersed in the sea of {{p11}} desire. Today Saleh Effendi one of four Egyptian Bahai brothers who has been visiting the Master for several weeks departed for Lyon and from there he will go to Luzanne, where he will be joined by Mirza Ali Akbar. The latter will leave tomorrow to stay in Luzanne a month and then going to London for three months to teach the Cause.

Dear Harriet!

Days come and go and I cannot realize their importance. It has been made possible for every human being, who is a seeker after truth to stand before one in whom the Spirit of God dwells! He dwells amongst us as a King of Servitude, Patience and loving kindness. For the last few days I have had glimpses of his Patience. If he had no other attributes except Patience and forgiveness, he would yet be the Supreme Master of our hearts. {{p2}} Last night I sat in my bed and thought over the height and altitude of his Patience! One can never dream that divine Patience could rise to such imperial heights. The way he has overlooked the shortcomings of others - even of some who consider themselves Bahais - is my greatest example. In order to describe a thing I must comprehend it from every standpoint and it is possible to bring within my grasp, the wonderful majesty and beauty of his Patience. His is Glory and Power! May we all drink one drop from the sea of his Patience! May we all receive one ray from the sun of his Forgiveness!

Today it was early when the Master called me into hi Presence; soon other Persians arrived and in a while Samavar was brewing. Mirza Ali Akbar asked him that in the West it was often stated that in the Bahai Cause, work had taken the place of prayer and this had lead to the wrong idea that there was no prayer in the Bahai Dispensation. The Master said: Religion without prayer is no religion; but in this Movement work and worship must go hand in hand; one must inspire the other. However, there may one who would quate this plans and claim that he did not need to pray, let him work all the time because his work will be accepted as prayers. This man is like the Mohammadan {{p4}} who never prayed in his life. The priest asked him: "How is it that you do not pray?" He said, "because the law of prayer is abrogated in the Koran." "Oh! I have never heard about it" "Yes! have you not read in the Koran where God says, do not approach prayer?" "Yes, but why do you not complete the verse by quoting the rest of it wherein God says Do not approach prayer while you are in a state of drunkenness." "All right! but it is impossible for a Muslim to remember everything in the Koran." "Yes! but the trouble with you is that you remember only that which is useful to your own purpose and forget the rest." The Master said that there will be found always in all the religions, people {{p5}} who will quote only a certain text which will advance their aims over and purposes, but such soul are not reliable.

The authenticity of the Bible was discussed. The Beloved said: It is evident that the five books which are generally attributed to Moses were written by Ezra the high priest. Only the Tablets and the Commandments belong to Moses. The contents of the Books will bear out this argument, because many events were recorded which transpired long after Moses death. There was a school of philosophers today in Europe who deny, not only the authenticity of the Bible but try to prove there was not such person as Jesus Christ; that the Christ was an Ideal invented {{p6}} by the apostles that the Evangelists in writing the Gospels stole the utterances of the ancient sages and Rabbi's and attributed them to this Ideal Christ. But all these are mere assertions and they cannot be proven.

His talk today concerned firmness and steadfastness in the Cause and the importance of the Covenant. This was the first time that he had ever spoken about the Covenant in Paris, because the conditions are different. People do not comprehend the significance and importance of the Covenant. They all love the Master {{p7}} and will do anything he says and obey his commands but the Covenant is a subject that is seldom discussed here. This shows us again that Abdul Baha like a skillful physician, prescribes medicine according to the aliments of the patients.

In the afternoon Miss Edith Sanderson called and begged the Master to allow her and her mother to entertain Rouha Rhanour and her husband. After much reluctance, this was accepted and so our honoured new guests will be living at Miss Sanderson for the next month or two.

At seven o'clock, Mirza Aga Khan Gaemmajami and Aga Faraj, our poet departed for Persia. Abdul Baha called them to his own room and {{p9}} talked to them in private. Then he came out of his room carrying two lovely carnations in his hands giving one to each. They fell at his feet and wept. They must not cry he told them! They must return to Persia with a heart full of the glad-tidings of heaven. They are in his hearts. He will lie always with them and they will never be forgotten. It was a touching separation. We were so sorry to lose them, especially Aga Faraj who was a source of great joy to the heart of the Beloved. He loves simple, sincere souls. Blessed are the pure in hearts for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven. {{p10}} Aga Faraj was a fine, simple, sincere Bahai; one who served the Cause at all time, not so much by word or eloquence but through deeds and actions! May God keep Aga Faraj for a long time and grant him health and strength to serve his Lord for many a year!

Mirza Ali Akbar became sick and his condition brought forth two stories from the Beloved. Here there are: In Acca there was a Persian Bahai who was a very good believer. An Arab who was very much attracted to the Cause, became his friend. Their friendship grew to such an extent that they called each other 'brother' and they were seen most of the time in one another's company. It happened that the Persian was stricken intermitted fever. His Arab friend was deeply grieved over the news and could not rest before seeing him. Once a day {{p12}} he entered the house with a big jar of cold water in his hand and was led to the room of the patient. He placed the jar of water beside the bed and inquired about the health of his friend. "How are you?" "Oh! I am not feeling well" The Arab got his hand inside of the bed. "Oh! Please do not let thy hand touch my body because I am shivering with cold." "I will not do anything of the kind." And without any sign of joking, with the greatest amount of dignity he raised the jar of icy cold water and poured over him. Bewildered with the sudden shock, like a wild animal, he sprang out of his bed. The Arab ran away and the Persian was running after him. Finally he was caught, thrown on the ground and given a good beating. The poor Arab cried out: My "brother", why do you hate me? Did I not treat you? "Treated me! Shame on you! {{p13}} calling yourself my 'brother'. The noise and the confusion brought many people to the rescue. The Persian was soaked to the skin, shuddering with cold and swearing aloud and beating the poor Arab. Finally they were separated and strange to say the Persian never had any more fever and the two become better friends and brothers!

Abdul Baha remembered that during his childhood he had a coloured servant whose name was Moharek. He was big and strong. At that time Abdul Baha was six or seven years old and with his family he was travelling, taking Moharek with them. On the way Moharek was stricken down with fever. In the Orient, often when a person is in fever, he goes and sits in the sun. Now Moharek had a very fur coat with {{p14}} which he covered himself and stretched in the sun. His fever was so severe that he shook and tremble like the leaf of a tree. In the party there were several children, amongst them Abdul Baha. Then children would hide themselves and watch Moharek going toward his sun my shot and lie down. His trembling at times was so violent that even the fur coat trembled. Then quietly, on tip toe the children approached, and one by one sat on him. When Abdul Baha's turn came he would go and sit on the children. Suddenly Moharek would have one of his terrible fits and the children rolled all over the ground. He took several loses of quinine with little result. One day he told the children to come early next morning and he will show them how he was going to heat himself. Early morning all the children were there and saw Moharek sitting in the sun and shaking as usual but with a big basket of prunes before him. He started to eat the {{p15}} prunes and every time he took one mouthful he shook more. After this treatment, he became will and never had any more attacks of fever.

Dear Harriet!

What is the object of the Bahai Movement? It is the unification of religions? Is it universal Peace? Does the Bahai religion mean to go to the meeting and listen to a good speech? Does it mean a system of new ideals for the progress of humanity? The Bahai revelation means the succor of the poop and helpless in a practical manner. We must embody the lofty principles of Baha-ullah in our daily life. We must be as charitable, as loving, as helpful, and as benevolent to our brothers and sisters as Abdul Baha. If the Beloved heard that one Bahai had really helped another person, even of that person was his enemy, he would be made very happy. I hope the reports coming to Abdul Baha from many ports of {{p2}} America will not consist only of the gatherings held, speeches delivered, plans proposed, amended and never carried out, discussions continues and small things magnified while the big things overlooked - but the reports consist of the assistance given to the helpless, the hungry ones fed, the naked clothed, the children educated, social conditions bettered through the endeavors of the friends, the ignorant made wise, the poor succored, the orphans taken care of, the Cause proclaimed, the teachings promoted, the law of God made manifest in the hearts and the essentials of divine civilization upheld. Such news will always gladden the heart of Abdul-Baha. Such activities will confer upon the friends the heavenly benediction! Such deeds will make them the beloved by Baha-ullah!

{{p3}}

If each Bahai made up his mind to speak about this Revelation atleast to one new person in a month, or in each 3 mouths, or let us say one in a year, ere long the present merchant will be doubled. This is the Cause of God. He will assist whomsoever arises to serve Him! These teachings will be spread all over the world. There is not a shadow of doubt about this. But it is hoped that we earnest laborers in this Vineyard, sincere gardeners in this orchard and the stand bearers of this Army. If we only arise, the hast of the supreme concourse will assist us, the Victorious Lord will reinforce us, the Countenance of the King of Kings will smile upon us and the sun of Reality will encircle us with its glorious rays.

{{p4}}

Every morning is a heavenly blessing to be with the Beloved, because from his life fall pearls of wisdom and knowledge. While we drink tea he walked and spoke on spiritual matters, soul-uplifting, spirit-inspiring! He was walking strong with the constant descent of the Holy-Spirit! He said: The Cause of will soon throw a great reverb Rotan throughout the pillars of the world. It will embrace in its fall the East and the west. Its pourer will penetrate through every stone of creation. Its imperial Tent will be filtered upon the apex of Existence. Its invisible Army will conquer the cities of the hearts! Its royal raider will be set upon the brow of humanity. Its throne will be established amongst the children of men. Its heavenly scepter will sway nations and {{p5}} empires! and its spiritual influence will be feet by the people of every clime. Let the weak in heart be cheered! and the despondent made hopeful! Lovingly remembered Aga Foray and willingly asked us whether we have kept any copy of his poetry. We all answered in the negative. A propose of something he told us the story of two men in Acca: Reza borrowed from Hassein 300 dollars. As they relied upon each other they did not exchange any notes between themselves. After a while Reza gave Hassein  an account. Later an incident created ill-feeling. Reza denied that Le owed anything to Hassein and Hassein insisted that he owed him $300 denying that he had ever received $100. Finally Hassein came to the Master and plead him to make Reza pay his three hundred dollars.

{{p6}}

Have you received "the Master asked" anything on account? You must tell the truth; otherwise, I will not judge between you." "How can I tell the truth, because if I confess that I have already received $100 he will not pay me the rest. "The Master sent for Reza and commanded him to pay back to Hassein $200.00. The man started to cry and lament but the Beloved stopped him short and talk him that there was no use in carrying along like this. He must pay back the money he has borrowed!

Two ladies were introduce and they inquired about the health of the Beloved. He said: Praise be to God that his spiritual health was very good. Physical health had no importance in his sight. If the friends were always attached with the Breaths of the Holy Spirit {{p7}} he would be ever in good health. This union was good. This was union not followed by any separation. Le then strive that they may always be alive with the Divine Breaths.

In answer to a question on the Bible he said: There are three ancient Bibles. 1st the Jewish Bible, 2nd the Sanhedrein bible which was by the seventy wisest Rabbis into Greek at the time of Plotergy, 3rd the Samaritan Bible. These three Bibles differ a great deal from each other on historical ground. For instance, in one Bible you read the age of a certain patriarch was 120 yrs; in another bible it says he was 80 yrs. old and in the third bible. It is most difficult to say while one of thier three Bible is correct, for each seat holding fast to his ever bible doing it to be the only authoritative one and the other two as unreadable. Therefore all the historical parts of the Bible were written by historians and commandments and the Decologne belong to Moses. To two other victories he said: The Sun of Truth has shone forth from the horizon of the East casting its rays in the West. Now it is the beginning of the Cause in Europe. It is the early down. Ere long the sun shall rise and will be stationed in its station then ye shall see now the whole of Europe is illumined. At noon the Beloved could out and gave a witty address on the "good and the better."

Monsons one of the nobles of Persia, residing in Rosht. Sardan Monson is a very important personals and his influence it will spread beyond the conflict of Rasht. At five o'clock he returned but very tired for he had to talk with this man all the time. Mon. and Madame Dreyfus come in and {{p10}} they were ushered into the Beloved's private room. Aja Layad Abunad was also present. I have seldom enjoyed anything as I enjoyed the anecdotes of the Cause related by the Master. It was to me a most wonderful afternoon.

Here I will relate a few stories I heard from Sayad assadullah and Nurja Ali Akhar!

When Abdul Baber was a child. Baha-ullah lived in Majanderan. At that time Baha-u-llah avene lorge nerds of {{p11}} cattle. One day Abdul Baha went to the village with a servant and which walking in the field he endures across one of the Sheperds who was taking one of a large number of sheep probably two or three hundred. The Shepered knew Abdul Baha and asked: "Will you let me have this hero of sheep?" "All right! It is yours!" The support did not dare to contradict Abdul Baha but he fears Baha'u'llah may get angry with him. After a day or two guests arrive and Baha'u'llah sent for a sheep to be killed and food prepared. They told him that "Aga" had given away all the sheep to the shepherd.

"Very good! You may then busy. Fears afterwards, Baha-ullah oneday recalling this might in Acca says: "Watch Aga for his generosity, someday he may even give himself away." One day which the Master was walking in the narrow street of Acca a beggar came to him and begged alms. The Beloved pushed his hand into his pocket and took out a piece of what should be silver money equal to one dollar and placed it in the hand of the beggar. He went away and after a minutes he returned with sign of excitement in his face. "O Master! O Master! Look what you have given me! This is a gold pieces of $25." The Master {{p13}} looked at the Money and said My Mother! This is your Kismet! It is your money. What does out of my pocket never returned to it.

Another time Abdul Baha came across another beggar. This day one of the pilgrims was following him. The Master asked him whether he has a Majidi. He had not have! Immediately he took out a golden chain and gives it to the poor. Afterward the pilgrim located the beggar and his best to by the chain for many Majistics but he would not sell it, when Mirza Ali Akhor was travelling in Persia teaching the Cause, great personage in the course {{p14}} of conversation told him that a Bahai but he had not seen the Bab nor met Baha-ollah but the traces and wonderful signs which appeared from this third who called himself the servant were miraculous enough to conviction anyone of the greatness of his station and the submits of his divine spirit.

For the last few days I have been reading a little book called the little flowers of St. Francis of Assisi. It contains the interesting account of his travels and interesting account of his travel and preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and certain incidents in his holy and sweet life of poverty. The story is much similar to the accounts of the Bahai teachers in the Orient and it gives us a lovely glimpse into the past and how the history repeats itself in the present. I like to quote here one of his addresses to the birds of the air. St. Francis was travelling with two of his holy disciples toward another town. As with great fervor he was going on the way, he lifted up his eyes and {{p2}} beheld some trees hard by the road whereon sat a great company of been well-night without number. Here he stands still and shows that depth of tenderness and love towards all the creatures which we have often witnessed in Abdul Baha. "You shall wait here for me" he said to his companions," and I will go and preach unto my little sisters, the birds." Is not this beautiful? Which I read this, a similar talk of the Master came to my mind given in the Golden Gate Park in San-Francisco as a company of friends were follows him. He said that as we talked here about the Kingdom of Abha even the trees and the birds receive a share of this divine joy through {{p3}} their subtle senses that they were not depressed of the Knowledge of the Infinite; the trees with their outstretched branches pray to God; The birds through their wondrous song a glorify the Almighty.

Now of the address of St. Francis to birds of the air:

"My little sisters, the birds, much bounden are ye unto God, your Creator, and always in every place ought you to praise them, for that He hath given you liberty to fly about everywhere, and hath also given you double and triple raiment's. Still more are you beholden to Him for the ambient of the air which the hath appointed for you; beyond all this, you saw {{p4}} not, neither do you reap; and God feuded you, and gives you the streams and the fountains for your drink; the mountains and the valleys for you refuge and the high trees whereon to make your nests; and because you know not how to spin and sew, God clothed you, you and your children; wherefore you creator loveth you much, seeing that He hath bestowed upon you so many benefits, therefore, my little sisters study always to give praises unto God. 

And so the book is filled with interesting episodes illustrating the life of St. Francis of Assisi corresponding so much to the muorners of oriental Bahai teachers.

Today the Master received many people in the morning. Being Sunday all those people who could not come during the week came today and so there was gathered a large company of hungry and thirsty souls after the bread and water of life. Early in the morning, he talked on the present situation of Turkey and its utter helplessness in the fac   of the European coalition against her. Although a great door of salvation is open before her face, she lies down helpless; likewise the condition of Persia is pitiable indeed. God has prepared for them a Cause around which revolves the Kingdom of might and power yet they {{p6}} do not avoided themselves. They do not see the light neither do they hear the music. Many Persians and Armenians arrived on the scene and he received them with open heart and arm. He talks with everyone according to his comprehension and so if a thousand people seeing and hearing him and go away and write down their impressions, each one will have a different story to tell but none will represent him in his universal, all changing aspect. There are a thousands of divine aspects to him just as there are facets of light in the diamond and rays emanating from the sun! 

{{p7}}

To every person or to every group of persons, he shows one of his aspects. To the Bahaist he is Known as the "Center of the Covenant," the Greatest Branch," the Mystery of God," "Him who is desired by God;" to the Mohamadans, the Christians, the Jesus, the Theosophists, the Spiritualists, the Materialists, the Atheists to each one of these, he may show one or several of his aspects, but he is above all these names and attributes, he is Imageless, Incomprehensible, deathless, Unchangeable. The other day as I was walked through the Oriental museum I saw many statues of the idols and gods as worshipped in India. Some of these statues had six {{p8}} faces, other four or twenty or hundreds of hands. Now we know that these idols are the statues of their prophets whom they considered as the mediumes between God and man. When they desired to express the idea that here was a prophet with many divine virtues and attributes they said he had a thousand hands. Later on the meaning was last and the word was left; the Kernal forgotten and the shell remained. Otherwise it is foolish to think of a man especially a divine Messenger with six faces, hundreds of eyes and a thousand hands. Such a person is an ultra feck of nature and most unpleasant to look at. His {{p9}} many hands would be always in his way and it would be too bothersome. Wouldn't it.

When Master came out to talk to reasons, crowded with Orientals and Occidentals he was in a laughing and happy mood. Evidently he wanted to laugh and make his audience laugh before delivering his short address. He looked around the rooms and spied the mother with her little daughter. With his blessed hands he made the sign saying French "Venez ice! Venez ice!" The girl runs toward him, insisting that her mother should go too. She sat next to the Master with the child in her lap.

{{p10}}

Meanwhile most everybody felt happy and laughing. The face of the Master was wreathed with heavenly smiles. He asked for fruit and Sayad Assadollah brought an orange. The Master starts to talk in English with the little girl. "I love you very much; do you love me very much?" The girl stopped a second, as though divining that something else was going to come uo and amidst the roar of laughter she mischievously answered: "No!" "Bravo" the Master came back more pleasured. Do you love your mother?" "No" the girl contented in her contraniness. "What! You do not love your mother! Do you love your father?" "No" the same {{p11}} mischievous answer was returned. "Then do you love God?" And instantly the answer was given in a loud, clear voice: "yes". Everybody was amazed by this visible demonstration and many though afterward that the Master wanted to give us a great lesson that we must not look at the personality but love the spirit which animates the personality, we must look at the light and not at the lamp; we must love the rose, no matter in which ground it grows, with his majestic wisdom he selected the tongue of a babe to teach us this matchless lesson of the Love of God!

{{p12}}

Then immediately he changed his mood and became serious. With one hand he fixed his fez and with the other hand rubbed his eyes and you could see authority on his ample brow and seriousness on his face. He opened his address by the following pithy remarks: The proof of life in the world of existence is motion. Every living being moves. If a moving creature becomes stationary it means death. Progress is the Keynote of motion and motion is the sign of life. He went on explaining the different Kinds of motions.

{{p13}}

After the meeting he shook hands with everyone and went out alone. In the afternoon he sent me to the afternoon he sent me to the house of Doctor Mohamad Khan to inquire about his health. I went there by the subway. Subway in Paris is very intricate affair and there are so many different roads to transfer, often one over another; long corridors and tortuous pathways joining different roads to each other and a stranger is amazed {{p14}} at the integrity of the Parisians who find their way easily and like go down in these subterreneous passages and come up at the other side of the city. It was about 4 o'clock when I returned with Doctor Mohamad Khan to find that Sardar Mansour and an Aremenian merchant were in the Presence of the Beloved. He was letting them about his experiences in America, his address in the Jewish Synagogues the account of a religious revival in Denver at the dedication of a catholic church. When they left, Madame Diastre {{p15}} and Mr. Gain (a young American who sings in Converts in Paris) were permitted to see him. The Master asked Doctor Mohamad Khan why he suddenly got sick. If our Doctor got sick others were expected to die. The landlord play on the piano, the tenants must dance.

He asked Mr. Gaoin's profession. "I sing at concerts and teach music" he answered: "Do you sing only earthly music or heavenly music too?" "Unfortunately only earthly music." "Yes, you must sing the melodies of heaven the notes and strains of which ravish the hearts."

{{p16}}

What is heavenly music?" "It is the explanation of the mysteries of God and the exposition of the realities and significances of the Kingdom of Abha."

He went out and returned in half an hour. The Persian Ambassador called and had a long interview.

Miss Hadjson came and as she was writing to Honolulu she asked the Master for a message. It was dictated to her.

The two Persian Bahais from the Jesus of Hamadan left last night. They had a loving {{p17}} for well from the Beloved.

Dear Harriet!

It was 7 am, the Master was in bed. He called me to himself and I hastened to him. He desired letters from America to be read to him. He was being made happy because they contained good news. Then he dictated answers. Words like unto the brilliant pearls from the divine treasury fall from his blessed lips. He wrote to a friend: "Thou hast written regarding the results of my trip to America." It's importance is not now manifest. Ere long you shall behold that these pure seeds have grown and how adorned the green meadow and verdant rose-garden. The hyacinths of realities and significances will appear and {{p2}} the plain and the country will be changed into the Paradise of Abha. Strive ye that they may grow very quickly. Water ye that field and take care of the tender shrubs planted by the hand of Abdul Baha so that they may yield luscious fruits, and become the fruit of the spirit. This is the greatest yearning of the heart of Abdul Baha that the American friends may grow in the life of the spirit, in the purity of the heart, in the sweetness of nature, in the beauty of character and in the strength of faith and assurance. Thus they may {{p3}} receive the inspiration of the Divine Spirit, increase their good deeds and advance daily along the path of spiritual Knowledge and wisdom. For only through the outpourings of the Holy Spirit will they become enabled to accomplish the services required from them by the Lord mankind. To accept the Bahai movement is very simple but to live up to its wonderful requirements is most difficult. We first forget all our former notions and make the principles of the Master as the guiding star of our lives. When we say, we are Bahais we are exceedingly honored, for we {{p4}} come under the Canopy of the most marvellous Cause in this world. We must fulfil our promises to Baha-o-llah! In the words of St. Francis: "Great things have we promised unto God, much greater far hath God promised unto us, if we observe what we have promised unto him." So we observed that we must become a Bahai not only be verbal declaration but by our deeds and actions. Otherwise, we may do more harm to the Cause than good. The people of the world except the Bahais to render the greatest service to the world of humanity.

Today the Master did not come out of his room. While lying down in bed he received the people. In the morning he called on Mirza Ali Akbar to his own room and asked to chant for him the prayers of Baha-Wollah. Tea was served to him in bed. When the people gathered in the salon he called them to his own room and gave them a very short address: He stated that his general health was well but his nerves were weak. His physical body was not afflicted with any ailment; but having lived forty years in the prison of Acca, the imprisonment often very severe, the air very {{p6}} bad, the climate humid, the conditions most harrowing, the confinement and anxiety nerve-racking, therefore his nervous system was weakened. When the Bahais arrived at Acca and the authorities imprisoned them in the Barrack, there was a very dump room that formerly the dead were washed in it - an undertaking - room. The floor was made of stone and covered with a thin old mat. This room was allotted to Abdul Baha and for more than two years he slept in it. That is why at this age he had a reaction in his nervous system. The nerves could not sand all these sufferings. It is more {{p7}} or less easy to strengthen every part of the body but when the nerves are weaken it is most difficult to reinforce them. Now he was suffering from a nervous breakdown; his body as a whole was well. Nervous ills play a great effect upon the human constitution and they stop him from all activities. He cannot see; he cannot eat; he cannot walk. But praise be to God that in the face of all these difficulties the outpourings of the Kingdom of Abha are descending uninterruptedly; the Providence of Baha Wollah is all-enriching, the rays of his Sun are shining and Abdul Baha's heart was in the utmost {{p8}} joy and fragrance. Although his body was weak, his heart was happy with the unutterable sweetness of Divine Presence. His point was this: He hoped that the friends will never become defeated. The more they are surrounded with tribulations and ordeals the greater may become their firmness and steadfastness. A person who withstands the attack of the army of persecutions and sufferings will become inherently great. He hoped that in the Cause of Baha-Wollah each one of the Bahai may become like unto a solid and immovable mountain and withstand {{p9}} firmly before every attack of calamity and adversity. Such were his holy commands! While he suffers from pain, he thinks of our progress! In sweet humility he admonishes us with the words of light and life. Untiringly he paves and straighten for us the path of duty and the road toward the Kingdom of Eternity; working on, preaching on, never dreaming of despair.

In the morning Entezam-es-Saltaneh came to call on the Master and was shown in his room. In the course of conversation about the confusion of the administration of Persian government {{p10}} the Master told him the following story: There was a Mirza Fazlollah who were looking for a government appointment. He came one day to the Blessed Perfection and begged him to use his influence before the Secretary of one of the Departments so that he may become appointed as a clerk. As he was a good and able man this was done and the next day the man took his position as a clerk. Now it so happened that the name of the Chief Clerk was also Mirza Fazlollah and as he was an old man he soon died. {{p11}} By sheer audacity the first man took on his own initiative the place of the chief clerk because of the identity of the names, he signed all the documents and were taken to His Majesty for royal approval. Without noticing the change, the Shah approved the papers and after that the man filled this important position for many years and flew knew of the change of personality.

In the afternoon the Master ate a bowl of the chicken broth and asked all of us to go to Mr. Scott's meeting. People were grieved because they could not see the Master. Mrs. Richard gave {{p12}} a most brilliant talk on evolution in French and Mrs. Bernard spoke in English about the attributes of the spiritual man. Both of them talked most effectively and I felt their spirit of earnestness and firmness. Then Mirza Ali Akbar chanted some of the Tablets of Baha-Wollah. On our return we found Miss Sanderson and Mrs. Bernard talking with the Beloved. Miss Sanderson is going to have meetings in her house after the departure of the Beloved.

{{p13}}

At this time the Master called me in. I saw him lying in his bed but a pile of letters just received from the Orient was before him. He was reading them one by one. He asked about the meeting, who talked, what was said topic which I answered accordingly. Mirza Hossein dropped in and he was talking very loudly in the other room with the Persians. The Master summoned him to his Presence and asked him what he was talking about. He said, he could not tell him now but it was about the Feast of Nou-Rouz. The Master laughed and said that there was no need {{p14}} of secrecy for he heard everything.

He told a story that once in Acca he was present in the Court room. The judge was deaf and could not hear everything. He was accused right along that he took bribes and granted judgements accordingly. On this special occasion the officers of the Court were divided into two parties; some upheld the integrity of the judge and others condemned him as a rascal and bribe-taker. Finally those who condemned him said, they were going to demonstrate to Abdul Baha that they were right in their suspicion. At the time there was a case pending before the {{p15}} judge. They got hold of the accused and told him to go beside the judge and whisper to his ear that he would give him an English pound if he would favour his case. The man did so and as the judge was deaf he had to talk aloud so that everybody could hear him. The judge assented to this proposition and gave him his small tobacco bag so that he may put the money in it as he was going to fill his pipe. Now the judge was waiting and the whole court's procedure was suspended. The accused man before everybody filled his pipe with tobacco and returned the bag to the judge. {{p16}} The judge felt the bag with his fingers but could feel no pound. Frowningly, he looked toward the man and beckoned him. "I do not find the money in the bag", he told the man in such a way that many people could hear him. "It is very strange, I surely put the money in." "Now! You rascal! You wanted to fool me! I knew you are a Jew! I should not have trusted you!" "Oh! Your honor! God forbid! Let me see the bag. Indeed I put the money in it." The judge furiously threw the bag towards him. The Jew instead of putting a pound in the bag dropped in a piece of five {{p17}} cents and handed it back to the Judge. He felt the size of the money outside and his face was then wreathed with smiles and amidst the uproar and confusion he sentenced the other party. But when he got out and found out that there was only five cents in the bag and his reputation as an incorruptible Judge ruined before everybody he fell into a fit of rage and fury and sent for the Jews and gave him a sound thrashing. As the above story was told, degree by degree the Master become more and more animated and with his hands and face {{p18}} he portrayed now the feeling of the crowd, now the rage of the Judge and again the glee of the Jew at his triumph.

Dear Harriet!

May I preface this day is communication by quoting Abdul Baha's message to the Bahai world: The invincible Hosts of divine Confirmations are standing in battle array upon the plain of the Kingdom of Abha, ready to rush to the assistance of any soul who steps upon the arena of service. This Army of God knows no defeat, and those who are enlisted in it will be reinforced by the invincible powers. This is the Truth and there is nothing beyond Truth but error.

May each one of us be faithful soldiers of this Celestial Army.

{{p2}}

For the last few nights the Master has been retiring to his room early , getting up earlier than ever and this morning we were all dressed and sitting in his Presence at 5am.,drinking the ruby tea and the nectar of love. He was sitting in a large armchair near the window overlooking the spacious square below, and as he was looking down a few nuns passed by and they interested him; therefore he spoke thus: Although in this Cause there are no nuns and nunneries, yet truly some of these nuns serve most faithfully the world of humanity. They have given up everything for the sake of Christ and devoting their time and energy to the education of the race. They are divided, however into several societies; some retire to the monastery and never leave the place. This is not at all commendable. No result is gathered from their lives. They enter the monastery alive and they are taken out when dead. Their entire lives are spent in the dark cells; never speaking with any human being, always praying or subjecting themselves to severe self-tortures. Many cannot endure such life and die within a short while. Although from one standpoint this is the highest degree of severance , yet it is a kind of severance which is not only harmful to the body polity but it is productive of no result what so ever.

Other of nuns serves the society in a whole-hearted way. They have built a school on Mount Carmel and although they are exceedingly poor they take the greatest care of the girl's students, teaching them most thoroughly. Amongst them you find nuns who in reality are humble, evanescent, believer and assured. They have no attachment whatsoever. In the religion of Christ spirituality, severance and detachment were infinite and of a higher degree than other religions! Once Abdul Baha was walking on the slope of Mount Carmel and observed a nun pilgrim who was going up the mountain with a great humility, attraction, and enkindlement, and singing anthems of praise and glorification. Her spiritual state affected him for she was weeping and singing most sweetly, thanking God for the Glorious previlege of pilgrimage to His Mountain. Abdul Baha stayed in his place and watched her till she got out of his sight.

{{p3}}

At another time one of the most accomplished French girls from an aristocratic family came to Haifa and desired to become a Carmelite nun. She was very attractive and beautiful and many people came to her, explaining the hard and fast rules of the monastery. No! Nothing would move her from her resolution. She was willing to submit to all the severe disciplines. Then on a special day, she was dressed in her costly robes and entered the church. Many people had come from the neighboring lovers to witness the ceremony and the church was packed with a crowd of curiosity-seekers and in the audience there were many Musulmans. When she entered the church, all the eyes were focused on her face. Slowly she neared the altar and knelt down before the Crucifix. Then amidst the chanting of liturgies and incense burning her long golden hairs were shorn and she was taken behind the altar. After a while she was brought back dressed in a long, black, sackcloth and hood. The transformation was so tragic that the audience was shocked and men and women wept bitterly. Then gloomy priests brought in a hearse and as though she was dead, they placed her in it and forlorn music carried her out of the church, out of the world of sunshine and beauty into the nunnery, into the world of gloom and death. 

{{p4}}

Abdul Baha spoke most lovingly about Mirza Abdul Fazl: He is a most blessed soul. He has sacrificed his life to the Cause of Baha-Ullah. He does not think of his own comfort, his ease and his life. He is a real monk living in the world. He is the embodiment of sincerity.

He called in Mirza Ali Khan Adeeb and instructed him to leave for Marseilles and welcome Aga Mirza Jalal and company and conduct them safely to Paris.

{{p5}}

About ten o'clock many people arrived and received the blessings of his words and presence. at noon, he come out and based his address upon the physical and spiritual health. Towards the end he said: He hoped the holy Reality deposited in the Bahais by the hand of God may gain victory over the physical reality so that at every moment they may obtain a new spirit, a new illumination, a new power and a new honor.

{{p6}}

He did not go out today and after lunch a young Turk from Luzanne came to see him. The talk was very animated and interesting. Abdul Baha's gestures and the movements of his hands are the most eloquent traces of his divinity. Under strong emotions he is changed into Divine Humanity.

{{p7}}

He went out with Doctor Mohamad Khan and Aga Sayad Ahmad to see our new apartment and returned perfectly satisfied. The rooms are on the third floor. The number of the Beloved's room is 17 and 18 is allotted to Mirza Mahmond and myself. No. 20 is for Sayad Assadulla. It is called Martha-Pension 97 Rue Lauriston and is only two short blocks from our present address. Arrangement is made for us to board there and the Master's lunch and dinner will be cooked in Mon. and Madame Dreyfus apartment and brought here. Mon. and Madame Dreyfus were most anxious to have the Master with one of his secretaries line in their apart; but he did not accepted their kind invitation and hospitality, because as he lovingly remarked: He had travelled with his secretaries for one year and he could not think to separate from them. They must live all together.

{{p8}}

On his return from the inspection of the new apartment he was going to open the door of his room. For a few moments he searched through his pocket to find the key but he could not. In a harmonious helpless manner he called: Doctor Mohamad Khan! Come here and search the key through my pockets. Dr. Mohamad Khan ransacked  the pockets of the Master and a pile of silver coins and candies were brought and the key was found and then the door unblocked.

{{p9}}

He entered the large salon and there were a few Persians present. He spoke on the materialism of Paris. He said: Paris is like a very large, clean stable where many millions of horses are well fed, well-kept and well trained; but you do not expect to find spirituality, the Knowledge of God, the Love of God in a stable. Do you? If you do find, then God has worked a miracle.

{{p10}}

Mon. and Madame Bernard and Miss Sanderson came in and the Master talked with them. To Mrs. Bernard he said: You have travelled through India and know what kind of people they are; now is the time to go to Persia and see with your own eyes how the Bahais are enkindled and attracted! They are the flames of the divine torch. When you came in touch with the Persian Bahais, you will forget everything. Abdul Baha illustrated this by a story. When the Persian government imprisoned Baha-Ullah in Teheran and all his prosperity was confiscated, Abdul Baha's mother, his younger sister and himself were left homeless.

In order to release herself from the constant persecutions of the people she rented a humble house in another part of the city, where people could not recognize her. She would go out herself and buy for her children bread and cheese; that was all she could afford. Notwithstanding this they were in constant danger of the attack, for it was enough to be known as Bahai and life would be forfeited. One midnight they heard loud knocking at the door. Abdul Baha went behind the door and asked: "Who art thou?" "I am Mirza Mohamad of Tabriz" a voice answered. The door was opened and he came in. First he chanted one of the supplications of Baha-Ullah; then he started to sing and dance saying, tomorrow he will be martyred in the path of the Blessed Perfection. Was he not the happiest man in the world until daven he saying and danced. No one could not keep him quiet. Then after sunrise, he went out and immediately he was taken by the enemies and put to death. While he was under the sword he threw the spectators into a panic of wonder and amazement by raising his voice to a high pitch and singing verses and poems of Baha-Ullah. Thus he met death with a cheerful countenance.

This is the exalted state of divine attraction and happiness. Happiness consists of the Love of God.

{{p11}}

When Abdul Baha was in the barrack of Acca he was most happy. When they pillaged all his family belongings in Teheran he was most happy. He remembered a time when as a child he was very hungry. He told his mother that he was hungry. She did not have anything in the house except a handful of flower which she put it in the palm of his hands and with a little water turned it into dough and he ate it because she could not afford anything else. Under all circumstances Abdul Baha has been most happy.

{{p12}}

It often happens that a man with the greatest amount of wealth is detached and another man's heart attached to a small thing. There was once two men, the first unbeliever but wealthy, the second believer but poor. The latter called on the former and after dinner they went out to take a walk. On the way they started to talk about the holy land and its historical interests. The poor man said to his wealthy companion, it would be so wonderful if we could take a trip to those sacred places. "All right! I am ready. "They walked and walked till sunset. Then the poor man asked his friend "Where are you going?" "What have you forgotten! We were going to the Holy Land!" the other answered, "Certainly not like this." "Oh! Yes! We are going to walk on foot!" "This is impossible." "Why not?" "Because it is too far." "If you want really to go, wait a little while and I will go and bring my donkey." "Your donkey! I have so many horses in my stable and never thought of them! Strange that you are a believer and your heart is attached to a donkey!"

{{p13}}

I received today a newspaper from Finland containing a long article on the Bahai Cause with the photograph of the Master. It was very interesting! One of his addresses delivered in London was printed in it.

Love to all.

Dear Harriet!

It is now after midnight the Master just returned from Miss Sanderson. Rouha Khanom and Mirza Galal having arrived at ten o'clock tonight and he was waiting at Miss Sanderson to greet them. The meeting of the father and daughter was most tender and touching. There is no doubt that after one year of separation the longing was most intense. She fell at the father's feet and wept the tears of joy. The father consoled her and inquired about her health and then a general discussion was followed and later dinner served. They had one day of rough weather after leaving Port-Said but the rest of the passage was smooth. Rouha Khanom and her companion as I heard from Mirza Ali Adeeb who went to Marseilles to accompany them to Paris were dressed in European style with this exception that their heads were covered with shawls. He also told me Rouha Khanom's physiognomy is similar to the Master's. Is it not wonderful to have her in Paris! Miss Sanderson is very privileged indeed to entertain her. It is a rare gift of heaven that is allotted to few mortals.

{{p2}}

At 3:30am I was awakened from I awoke of sleep and heard the voice of the Beloved next door. He was communing with God! "O God! Thou art the Deliverer! O God! Thou art the Deliverer! Ya Baha El-Abha!" Thus for a long time he was supplicating and praying unto the Lord! I was now fully wide awake and could hear the groaning of his heavenly heart and the lamentation of his divine Spirit! I was never so effected in my life. Here was the Beloved of the world all alone in his room praying for all the friends all over the world. It was indeed a spiritual experience; one never to be forgotten in this life, a consolation to the spirit and the balm of the heart. After a while I saw through the crack of the door his candle lighted and he got out of the bed and began to pray: Oh! So earnestly tell the doven. Wonderful night! Thus to be privileged to witness and to hear the Words of invocation ascending to the Throne of the Almighty from the holy lips of One who is today the nearest to God! While I was lying down in bed and hearing the Master's prayers meth ought the angels of light descending and carrying away the Celestial words to the Court of heaven.

{{p3}}

When I stood before the Beloved this morning he was in a contemplative mood. He said that every deed, action, word and the manner of one's walking must diffuse spiritually and detachment. Then he shut his eyes, as though tired from all this travelling and very slowly he spoke: We must try to return very soon to Haifa. Then upon the mountain all above pray and supplicate with God. His voice had now become very soft and as though talking in a whisper he continued: There one finds the ecstasy of spiritual bliss supplication invocation prayer inspiration. The atmosphere of the room had become by this time very spiritual and most elevating.

Although he was very busy packing his own belongings and papers he found time to meet the people and dictate Tablet for some important personages. At twelve o'clock he gave his last address in 30 St., Didier. There were quite a number of people present and his talk was on Macrocasm and Microcasm, a very wonderful address. It was very instructive.

{{p5}}

At the table he told us a funny story: There was a Baktashi who passed by the door of a theological seminary. He saw the attendant beating a dog. "Why do you beat this dumb dog? asked the Baktashi. "Because it has entered the seminary and made the place unclean." "But this dog is unintelligent man. Look at me! I who am an intelligent man never enter a theological seminary! Do I?"

In the afternoon Mon. and Madame Dreyfus and a few other Persians came. We were busy packing and at 5 o'clock all over trunks were transferred to Mortha-Persian. The Master's room was prepared and conquests of flowers, loving remembrances from the friends adorned the mouthpiece. For the last few days the Master ate only chicken.

Ahmad.

Dear Harriet!

Before writing the events of the day I like to translate a few general quotations from the Tablets of Our Beloved:

##Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

"The perfect man is a mine of mercy and benevolence. It is necessary to be kind to both man and animal; for both have received a share from this life and are endowed with feelings. Mercy is commended and accepted by His Highness the Almighty whether exercised toward man or animal; even mercy and kindness practiced toward the plant is acceptable and beloved. Undoubtedly it is more praiseworthy to rear and water a tree than to exterminate it from its root."

{{p2}}

##Significance of the sixth hidden words

"Receptivity is necessary. The love of God is like unto the ray of the Sun. As long as the mirror is not polished from the dust, the rays of the Sun shall not become manifest and revealed therein. For the appearance of the ray of the Sun which is the love of God depend upon the transparency and clearness of the mirror."

{{p3}}

##Significance of the 25 hidden words

"It means that there are degrees in the world of existence. However much the inferior degree may progress it cannot become equal to the superior degree, but each degree can advance through its own sphere wherein infinite virtues are obtainable. For example however much the mineral may advance it cannot gain hearing and sight. But in the mineral Kingdom there are infinite degree of advancements. For instance it is possible for the coal to become diamond, but the stone will never obtain sight and hearing. It will advance in its own degree. Likewise, the finite will never become the Infinite neither the Infinite will become the finite."

{{p4}}

##Significance of: Thou shalt find me standing within thyself mighty powerful and supreme in the Hidden Words

"This means, when the mirror is purified and turned toward the sun, the Bestowels of the Sun will become reflected therein. The dice of the Sun does not enter in the mirror, nay rather it is stationed in its own station of sublimity. But because the mirror is pure only a reflection of the Sun is seen therein."

{{p5}}

##The Influence of the Cause

"In this day the call of ya Baha El-Abha is raised from all the regions and the lights of the Teachings of Baha-Ullah have illumined the globe."

##The results of the Master's stay in the house of an American Bahai

"Thy house become my abode and my house. We lived in that house many days with the utmost joy and fragrance. Day and night we were engaged in mentioning ya Baha El-Abha and promoted the religion of God. Truly I say that house is my house; therefore the name of God must be raised from it forever."

The hotel life has for the present destroyed our regime so that today we took our tea downstairs in the general dining room and the Master had his in his own room. Before 7 o'clock he called me to his own room and dictated many Tablets for the Persian believers. There was one to a South African friend the translation of which you will read in another communication. I send you also a little Bahai pamphlet which has been published there on the Bahai Movement for "home consumption".

{{p7}}

About 9 o'clock the Master left the hotel for Miss Sanderson's home to see Rouha Khanom and Aga Mirza Jalal. He stayed there till noon, had his lunch at Mon. Dreyfus and rested there for the afternoon. at four o'clock he called again at Miss Sanderson. A doctor has already been consulted and has given the hope that Rouha Khanom will be well before long; however, there will be a specialist in a day or two to examine the patient thoroughly. At five o'clock the Master came to the hotel and it was as though we have been separated from him for an age. He came in our room and sat near the window. He related the story of the serious sickness of Aga Mirza Jalal many years ago and how everybody thought him dead for two hours. He was attacked with typhoid and when the crisis came he swooned and was unconscious for almost 2 days. The Master healed him and today he is a very strong man.

{{p8}}

In the morning we stayed in Mirza Hossein arrived. He read to us his poem which he will read tomorrow afternoon on the occasion of Non Rouz before nearly 200 Persians in the Persian Embassy. They are gathering there to celebrate the national Fete. He told us the story of his visit to Tiberius to see the Master nearly 20 years ago. In the afternoon Aga Mirza Jalal came to the hotel and we were most pleased to see him. I found him a gentleman in every way. We received a large bouquet of lovely flowers from the Persian Ambassador for the Beloved as a token of his remembrance for the Non Rouz. The Master went again to Miss Sanderson  and returned at nine. He ate only a few spoon of chicken broth and after taking a bath he retired to his bedroom.

The woman companion of Rouha Khanom is named Rezvonieh. She is the wife of the brother of Ahmad Yozdi, the daughter of Haji Sayad Jonad and the mother of 2 or 3 children. She speaks French very well.

Dear Harriet!

Today the Bahais all over the world are celebrating Now Rouz, the glorious New Year. It is a day of new resolutions, higher aims and loftier intentions. It is a day that new lives are consecrated to the holy purposes of the Bahai Cause. My resolution is short and very simple. I wish to pledge my life anew to the noblest Cause and the purest Ideal of this Radiant Century. I desire to serve whole-heartedly my fellow men. I yearn to contribute my share of work to the construction of the glorious place of Peace. I long to be a faithful labourer in the Vineyard of Our Lord! I wish to be always truthful, sincere, faithful and grateful. I pray to be freed from the ties of attachment. I supplicate to God for the daily increase of capacity, understanding illumination {{p2}} and Knowledge. On this day I empty my heart from all the traces of ill-feeling, envy, jealousy and courteousness. I pray for the purification of heart, the clearness of vision, the wide range of sympathy, the simplicity of the child and the attraction of divine love. I aspire the flight to the highest summit of heavenly felicity. I long for the calmness of the soul, the peace of the mind, the serenity of conscious, the humility of the spirit and the patience of the elect. I beg for the virtues of Celestial world, the perfections of the angels of the Supreme Concourse, the resignation of the martyrs, the fire of the Love of God, the Breaths of the Holy Spirit, the enthusiasm of the Blessed faith and the flame of spiritual contemplation. May I ever be a fit instrument to serve the oneness of the world of humanity, to assist all the sincere lovers of man to raise the Banner of Conciliation in all regions and countries.

{{p3}}

This morning the Beloved called me twice and I hastened to get ready to go to him in as few minutes as possible. Being the New year I went right to him and kissed his blessed hands and according to our custom, I wished him a happy New Year. He hoped that in this new year there will be a greater spread of the Cause throughout the world and a greater outpouring of the holy-Spirit.

Having received lately cable messages from Chicago about the health of Mrs. Getsinger he asked me whether I have received any news about her condition. Of course I have had no intelligence of the matter whatsoever. He said: He was praying for her; because in the past she has served this Cause very faithfully. He desired to see her advance day unto day, to become more {{p4}} spiritual day unto day and to progress in the Cause day unto day.

He said that in this day the Bahais throughout the world celebrate the Feast of Nou Rouz and spend the hours in great rejoicing and happiness. He prayed that this Fete be blessed to all the friends in America! May each one of them become a mighty teacher in this Cause and spread the Glad-tidings of the Kingdom! In about ten years this Cause will be promoted most marvellously in America. He was ever expecting to see the appearance of a few souls upon the arena of action - souls who are detached, attracted, enkindled, devout and active, then this will be no doubt the majority of the people will become Bahais. This Cause will be promoted through severance from all else save God. Our capital is severance. He hoped each one of us may become the embodiment of this attribute.

When Abdul Baha was in Bagdad he had a coat which he wore over his shirt. It was made of very cheap stuff, the whole thing costing only one dollar. Having not the means to buy another he wore it till it was threadbare and he associated with all the friends and strangers while wearing it, notwithstanding this he was full of happiness, full of severance and his joy had no bound. In Bagdad the severance of the believers of God was a subject of discussion in all the circles. There were ten people living in one small room and after they did not have any other food then a few dates, yet from sunset till midnight and long after that hour they chanted prayers, sang and showed a merry heart, forgetting their outward circumstances and living only {{p6}} in spiritual atmosphere, full of sweet communion and delightful converse. Once there arose a dispute between the members of a family about the division of inheritance. The litigation dragged along and day by day the difference became more acute. When they realized that even the court will not do them any justice, they came to Baha-Wollah and pleaded him for a verdict and the readjustments of their claims. Baha-Wollah at first refused to discuss the case but they implored so persistently that finally he delegated Abdul Baha to go and settle their case in one day. Abdul Baha went and after reconciling the various factions divided the property into two parts. When noon arrived he went out and returned in an hour. He observed that the inheritors had divided the two parts into three parts. He inquired the reason. They said, that the third part was for him, on other word his fee. {{p7}} At the hour, he wore his threadbare coat on. He looked at the pile of all those objects and then he looked at his coat; he saw that he was independent of these things and he refused to accept. They insisted and he resisted. Finally Abdul Baha observed that it was useless to argue any longer with them. He said, all right; put all these things in one room. They did. He made them lock the door and seal it with wax. He got the key and went straight to Baha-Wollah. He related to him the transaction and begged him in case they came to him for further pleading to allow this third part to go to another member of the family who was disinherited through no fault of his own. Soon they arrived and started their pleading that Abdul Baha must accept his share - it was no more than right. {{p8}} On that day Baha-Wollah did not give them any definite answer; but they continued to come for several days, always urging the acceptance of the third part. Finally one day Baha-Wollah told them: Abdul Baha will accept his share unconditionally, that he must have the right to dispose of it as he is pleased; he may throw it into the sea or commit it to fire. They accepted this condition and Baha-Wollah calling in the disinherited man, gave him the key of the room wherein the objects and the documents were stored by Abdul Baha on that eventful day. A Tablet was revealed to our dear brother Doctor Zia Bagdad in Chicago in which a greeting for Nou Rouz was sent by the Beloved to all the friends.

Another Tablet with the Master's own hand was written for the family of Sayad Ahmad Bageroff of Teheran. The members of this family from the time of Baha-Wollah have rendered conspicuous services to the Cause. There were five brothers, all of whom {{p9}} were Bahais, and they were the descendants of Mohamad the prophet and consequently Baha-Wollah gave them the title of the "Five Sayads". This Sayad Ahmad is the son of one of those five herein is the Tablet: To the household oh his holiness Bageroff. Upon them be Baha-Wollah! He is God! O ye self-sacrificing household in the Path of the Merciful! It is the early morn of the Blessed Day of Nou-Rouz; the rays of the Sun of Reality are refulgent and manifest and Abdul Baha with infinite attraction, happiness and joyousness had taken the pen in his hand - so that he may write to that favoured and famous household, the felicitations of this acispicious Fete and congratulate {{p10}} you on this New year, in order that all of you may render thanksgiving unto the Glorious Lord for thus that entire family taking a shelter beneath the shade of the Providence of His Highness the One that generation becoming encircled with the rays of imperishable Glory. For the pillars (the "Five Sayads" who become Bahais and there founded this family) during the day of the Manifestation of the Revelator on Mount Sinai (Baha-Wollah) become attracted to the Forgiving Lord! O Lord! Reinforce all of them with Thy most great Power. (Signed) Abdul Baha Abbas.

He called on Miss Sanderson and Sayad Ahmad and myself went out to buy candies, fruits, nuts and cakes for the Fete. We got two large tables in the salon and decorated them tastily with lilacs, roses and other flowers. {{p11}} The Master sat in the Salon and received large delegations from amongst the Europeans and Orientals. Every one expressed his hearty felicitation and he discoursed on the significance of the Nou Rouz. In the afternoon important Persians like Sardar Asad and others payed calls. The Beloved urged everyone, especially the Western Bahais to eat candies. Many friends brought flowers. Large members of Persian students amongst them the brother of Godsea Khanour come to see him, and many of them were invited to sit at his table.

In the afternoon {{p12}} he told us to call in a body at the Persian Legation. There were more than hundred young Persians many of them dressed in French army clothes as they are army students. Mirza Hossein read his poem and toward the end a volume of applause greeted him. The whole embassy was decorated with flags and flowers. Large tables were grooming under the weight of delicacies. It was a lively scene of Persia in the making that one can seldom see anywhere else in Europe. After an hour we said goodbye to the Persian Ambassador. The Master also called and delivered an eloquent address. In the evening the meeting at Mon. Dreyfus was delightful and many people were present. Miss Fraser from London had just returned and she received a hearty welcome from the Beloved. His talk was a discourse on the Feast of Nou Rouz.

Love to all

To the maid-servant of God Mrs. Mary C. Haybittel.

South Africa

Upon her be Baha-o-llah!

He is God!

O thou daughter of the Kingdom!

Thy letter was received. Owing to the lack of time I write a brief answer. Its contents was in the utmost of sweetness. The letter was a sign of Love for the Manifest Light. Offer thou a thousand thanks unto the Lord for thou hast turned thy face toward the horizon of Reality and hast beheld the rays of the Sun of the Higher Universe. Thou hast a seeing eye, a hearing ear and a heart attracted toward the Kingdom of Abha!

Therefore with thy revered husband, thy beloved daughter, and those souls who have caught the splendours of the {{p14}} Sun of Reality, strive unanimously so that the Continent of Africa may become illumined that the world may become another world, divine enlightenment be diffused and the Blessed Tree of the Oneness of the world of humanity cast its shade.

I give thee the good news. Rest thou assured that thou wilt become assisted and confirmed. Consequently, arise with the greatest confidence of the heart and summon the people to the Kingdom of God and proclaim: Glad-tiding! Glad-tiding! The Morn of Guidance hath downed! Glad-tiding! Glad-tiding! The Sun of Reality hath shone forth! Glad-tiding! Glad-tiding! The Breeze of the Rose-garden of God hath wafted. Glad-tiding! Glad-tiding! A new Grace hath appeared in the world of humanity. Glad-tiding! Glad-tiding! The ideal of the solidarity of the human race hath pitched its Tent upon the apex of the world. Glad-tiding! Glad-tiding! The Flag of Peace and Salvation hath been unfurled in this century, waving over the East and the West!

Upon thee be Baha El Abha!

### Martha-Pension Family Hotel 97, rue Lauriston Paris March 22nd 1913

Dear Harriet!

This Pension life has disturbed our program. The Master does not deliver any more morning addresses and besides much of his time is spent with over new guests at Miss Sanderson. He passes there many hours during the day and as there are some specialist who have been called to examine the condition of the health of Rouha Khanom, his presence and assistance has been necessary.

{{p2}}

This morning several letters were read to the Beloved and in the course of his talk he said: Everyone of the believers of God must shine like unto the sun. The believers are the suns of the heaven of Baha-Ullah. They must illumine the world and exhilarate the souls and import spirit to the dead bodies.

{{p3}}

After drinking tea and meeting a few people, gathered downstairs, he went to Miss Sanderson. He had his dinner with Mon. Dreyfus and returned at half past two. Miss Fraser and Miss Hodgson were here. The Master pointing them out to a new corner he said: These two women are real Bahai workers. They serve the Cause day and night. Miss Fraser said, that on her return to London, Miss Buckton and herself will start for Edinburgh to teach the Cause. The Master praised her enthusiasm and zeal.

{{p4}}

On automobile was called and he took me with himself to meet Moneer Pasha. All the way along he was steeped in thought awhile did not say one word. At the door of the apartment he was welcomed by the Pasha and his wife. Both kissed his hands. There was present a journalist who had travelled in the Orient. Madame Lasherly who had visited the Master years ago in Acca and a few  Turks and Parisians. It was quite an informal affair for they did not expect the arrival of the Master. He came upon them unexpectedly. The journalist asked many questions from the Master. The Beloved spoke in excellent eloquent Turkish and Moneer Pasha translated into French. The talk was an exposition of true religions, that religion is divided into two parts essential and  non essential; that religion serves the world of morality; that the aim of religion must be a centre around which all the nations and people may gather. These are the basis of religion. But the priests and the Nullos and the Robbies have caused it to become a means of friction and discord. If religion is the cause of discord and hatred it is a divine calamity and we must shun it. He related instances from the Koran and the traditions that Mohamad was the greatest friend of Christ. The journalist and others were most delighted with the Beloved's talk. He took notes of the Master's talk and will incorporate them in an article. He requested the Master for a photograph and sent someone with us to get it.

{{p5}}

At five o'clock General Sherif Pasha who edicts a monthly magazine in French, defending the rights of the Ottoman Empire cause to see the Beloved. He is a very important personage, big physically and mentally.

{{p6}}

When he left, the Master went to his own room to rest awhile. About 7 o'clock, 3 very prominent Persians were presented to the Beloved with whom he talked for half an hour. Mirza Lotfollah Hakum from London arrived and was ushered into the Presence of the Master. He had the news of the meetings and the friends of that city, Lady Bloomfield and Mrs. Cropper, General Jack and Miss Rosenberg. All are well and engaged in spreading the Cause of God.

In the morning, the Secretary of the Esperanto Society called and he told the Master that yesterday he delivered an address on the Bahai Movement in Esperanto language before a large gathering in Sorbornne University. I asked him to bring me an outlive of his address both in French and Esperanto.

Long after midnight- it was probably three o'clock and then at five I could hear the Master praying, his voice rising melodiously. For a long time I sat up in my bed straining my ears to hear every burning word which issued from his holy lips and then in that calm and quiet atmosphere I fell again into sleep.

The magazine "Vahan" of the Theosophical Society in London has published an article on the Bahai Movement in this mouth issue.

Love to all.

Ahmad

Dear Harriet!

While the Master was walking today through the streets of Paris, two women passed by. They turned back and looked at him with wonder in their eyes. One whispered to the other: "Voyez, me cherie le Jesus Christ est retourne dans ce monde." (Look my dear, Jesus Christ has returned to this world.) Miss Hadjson who was walking behind, hearing this remark returned and talked to them about the message. They were much interested. Those who are endowed with spiritual perception can realize the importance of the Cause in a comprehensive way and feel that the foundation of the Bahai Movement is laid on the rock bed of eternal realities. For the presence of the Master is a mighty proof, for all the dreams and visions of the past prophets are embodied in this holy Personality. His example makes it possible for us to live the life of goodness, charity and {{p2}} loving kindness. He is the Pathfinder, the Pioneer, and we will follow in his wake with perfect faith and assurance. Our standard-bearer shall never make any mistake. With great sagacity and wisdom, he will carry to final victory his devoted army and crown all their campaigns with glorious triumphs.

Since we have come to this Pension, our morning visit to the Beloved are disturbed; Sayad Assadollah makes tea on a little alcohol stove, and takes it to the Master and we eat our breakfast in the divine room. Besides, there are not as many Persians as there were before and that Samavar which was brewing every morning in the other apart is silenced through the force of circumstances. However we enjoy the presence of the Beloved just the same. He shines like unto the sun upon all the people, wether believers or unbelievers; his mercy is universal, his love is unutterably divine, his compassion sweet and most beautiful.

{{p3}}

In Rasht we have a Bahai, well known to many believers in America by his title, Eltehajad Molk. This morning, the Master through his great love wrote him a wonderful Tablet with his own hand. I translate the first part: "He is shining from the Horizon of Faithfulness, Praise be to God, the Lamp is lighted and the Path hath become straight and manifest. The Breeze of Providence is spirit-imparting and the Sun of Reality brilliant and rays-giving. His holiness the Christ at the time of his ascension left behind only eleven disciples. Look at the results of the work of those souls! Praise be to God, that this Call is raised in Africa and in Asia; Turk and Tajik are awakened and made mindful and from America the reverbrating sound of the bombardment {{p4}} of the Oneness of the world of humanity is reaching the ears of every intelligent and sagacious person. Therefore, compare the present with the past and then thou cant realize what will happen in the not distant future.

The mail from America brought some letters, the contents of which were read to the Master. The good news made him happy, and he ever anticipates the progress of the Cause and the love and amity of the friends toward one another. Can America make itself a birth place of joy? A center of Bahai activity in charity, in practical philanthropy, in divine susceptibilities, in spiritual ideals? If such condition of accord and unity is realized, the Beloved will be made most happy!

Mirza Lotfollah Hakim was in Presence of the Beloved for a long time, receiving messages for various believers in London. To teach one of the friends he sent a loving message the result of which must be greater effort in the Cause.

{{p5}}

While I was translating in my room, word was sent up that someone is waiting downstairs to see me. I was wondering who should be this person who wants especially to see me. With much pleasant uncertainty, I went down and whom do you think I saw? Guess if you can! It was Mr. Stanwood Cobb! Well! of all of the places to see him in Paris! I couldn't believe my eyes! Oriental fashion, I kissed his face and then of course I was sure that he was not the ghost of Mr. Cobb. What is he doing? He is the Prof. of Latin etc in a travelling school headed by Prof. Sargent. There are eleven American boys who travel for eight months all over Europe and study, sight-see, and go from one country to another. They have been travelling already six months and the last places they {{p6}} visited were many cities in Germany and Holland. They are going to stay six weeks in Paris then England, then home. The boys study all the morning, go out together to see the historical places and museum in the afternoon, return to their hotel at 5 o'clock, write for one hour their diaries etc. I took brother Cobb upstairs and immediately the Beloved received him with an enthusiasm and intimacy that is born out of long acquaintance and friendship. He asked what he is doing in Paris.

Stanwood Cobb: I am on an excursion through Europe with a travelling school of boys.

A.B.: Do you take the boys also on an excursion through the world of the Kingdom?

S.C.: I have spoken with Prof. Sargent about the movement and have read the Paris talks to the students. They are all anxious to see the Master. Prof Sargent has written a poem to Abdul Baha. (Here the poem was produced and read).

A.B.: Excellent. Very good indeed. {{p7}} I am searching for a person like unto him, God willing, through your effort he will become spiritual, divine and illumined.

S.C.: I pray for him every night. He is a remarkable personality, a genius in many ways but he does not believe in religion. He is just now in great troubles and needs spiritual assistance. He is really a lover of the world of humanity. A.B.: God willing, the window of his heart will be opened and the sun of the hope will shine upon him. Hope is made possible through turning one's face toward God. If all the benefits of the world are made possible for man and he has no hope, he will not enjoy them. When man is surrounded with the difficulties and troubles, the only thing that will pull him through is the hope of the dawn of better days.

{{p8}}

S.C.: While in Germany I spoke with a woman who is the President of a college for girls. The mental abilities and spiritual susceptibilities were combined in her. I told her about the Cause and gave her the Paris talks. That night she read them to her pupils and when I called again, they all expressed great pleasure. I found amongst them a girl who had heard about the Cause in America from Miss Louise Stopfer (Mrs Manwell friend)

A.B.: God willing through the effort she will become fully informed with this Cause. I hope she will become divine, obtain heavenly Bestowals, make ideal advancement, and become the means of the illumination of those girls.

It is good that they breath is very effective. No mother with whomsoever, thou speakest about the Cause, he will be impressed and accept the revelation. This is because {{p9}} thou art seeking the good pleasure of the Lord. Thou art not serving the Cause for fame but to be drown near unto God. I hope that thou mayst become embodied spirit and personified light. Rest than assured that thou will become confirmed and assisted. I give thee the glad-tiding that thou will become inspired, thy heart will become illumined, thy thought will be enlarged. I give thee again the glad-tiding. Strive and strive that thou mayst become a pure light and a sanctified ray. Aga Mirza Jalal with Foad Effendi arrived and the Beloved left with them to call at Miss Sanderson. As he was going to stay there till 3 o'clock I took a long walk through Bais de Bologne with Mr. Cobb talking all the time about the {{p10}} Master, his teachings and the Cause in America. As it was Sunday and the sun was shining gloriously, thousands of men and women were walking through the spacious boulevards of the Bais. Mr. Cobb before leaving the Master arranged for a meeting on tuesday at 5 pm to bring the students and the Prof. to meet him.

On my return I found Miss Beatrice Erwin. She came to see the Master in London several times. She is a poetess and writer. She writes mystic and spiritual poems before various audiences and impersonates as she says the sound, the music and colours of life. She is a very interesting woman and she is most anxious to serve. She has now decided to write two articles on the Bahai Cause for an English Review, a most important British weekly which is circulated in intellectual and spiritual circles of England. {{p11}} We talked a great deal on the points that she must include in these articles and she was pleased with the result of our conversation. We invited her to have lunch with us. Miss Fraser came in and introduced them to each other. They were yet talking interestingly together when I left the salon and came up to my room.

At 3'oclock the Master sent for me from Miss Sanderson's house. He ordered to get a taxi and taking me with himself we called at the home of Ahmad Pasha, a Turkish general whose father was a lover of Baha-Wollah during the imprisonment in Adrianople. He was not at home, so the Beloved ordered another taxi and alone with him we drove through the Park Bais for two hours. {{p12}} The meadows, the trees were all green and refreshing to the eyes. We drove on and on passing by the lakes, cascades, open meadows verdant foliage and the Master all the time commenting upon the beauty of scenery. The Bais was simply crowded with people. Soon the clouds gathered in the sky and a terrific shower poured down, sending the people into a panic, heltic-sketter. On his return he found several people waiting for him. He asked a young man from what country he comes? He answered with fervor and real much vehemence. I am from -----. In order to gently rebuke him and show him the false emotion of patriotism he related the following story: Once upon a time the King of a certain country got hold of an owl and put it in a large golden cage hanging it in his royal Park which the King observed that the owl was not happy in his wonderful Park and always lament. "Oh! my {{p13}} country! O my country!" He ordered to let the owl fly out of the cage and with a number of his retinue he follows the course of the owl flight. After many hours the owl alighted on the dilapidated wall of a ruined and deserted castle and scratchingly cried out. "Oh how happy am I! At last I reached my beloved country! My abode of rest! My paradise of delight! My heavenly hope is now fulfilled!"

A propos of other subjects, the Beloved spoke about the pigeon carries. Hundred of years ago large correspondence was carried on between Bagdad and Damascus, Egypt and Palestine. Officials trained these pigeons, tied the letters to their feet and let them fly away. {{p14}} After days of flying the pigeons reached safely their destination. The delicacy, the beauty, the flavour of the fruits of the Orient and the accident were compared, giving preference, now to this and again to that.

The Beloved spoke earnestly on war and Peace. Ignorance and prejudice have encircled the nations of the earth and they are attacking each other with weapons of death instead of love. God has created man for the exercise of love; the will of God is spelled in letters of love but man acts against this will and presumptuously addresses God. God, thou dost not know the results of war. War leads us on to victory, to glory, to conquest, to prosperity. War is the path to honour. We love war, but thou dost tell us war is evil. We cannot believe in thy word. Thus {{p15}} mankind is immersed in the Sea of ignorance and blindness. While Abdul Baha was living in Acca he was always able to established peace amongst the Christians, the Jews and the Mohamadans, but when an orthodox priest or a Mullah or Rabbi would come to head these various sects, immediately the fire of hatred would be ignited by them. Because each one of them would thought that if he wanna let them joined another religion, calling its followers, infidels and heathers, his own slotion would be raised in the estimation of his people. These prejudices reached to such a high degree that the people killed each other in Fetoum not long ago. Strange!

The leaders of religions must teach their followers love and fellowship; they must exhort them to unity and agreement. They must show the greatest exertion in their direction. They must address the people and say! O ye people! What is this strife! What is this strangeness! What is this hatred! Verily, verily your God is one God! You are all his sheep. He is the kind shepherd! Let go of this dissention! Forget this animosity. Relinquish war! Follow Peace. Now the nations of the world are adding daily to the means of warfare and have become military lunatics. These are their thoughts. God has also His thoughts. Let us wait and watch to see whose thoughts will gain the upper hand!

A Persian was sitting on a chair, far away. The Master called him to come to the front. He asked him his profession and the answer was "tailor". Then he spoke again: There are some people who study for dress, work for dress, live for dress, walk for dress, eat for dress; in brief their lives are spent for the dress, the clothe, the style, fashion and made. To them the beginning and the ending of creation is spilled in one word. "Dress". They believe that God has created them for "Dress". There was a judge in Acca who spent two hours every morning over his toilet. He would sit before the mirror and painstakingly arrange his coat on West, brush his hair and at every turn {{p18}} he would look at the mirror (during these remarks he showed us with his hands, how the Judge conducted himself his morning toilets and it was simply side-splitting with laughter). One morning Abdul Baha called on him, not knowing his habit. His servant told him, the judge will be ready in a little while. He stayed ten minutes, twenty minutes, half an hour, one hour; finally he called the servant and asked him what was the matter? He laughed and said, the judge was making his toilet. Abdul Baha said, he could wait any longer let him come immediately. When the judge arrived he rebuked and told him that if he ever called again in the morning, let him just put on his long one coat and come out to see him afterward, he can go leave and make his toilet which injunction he followed ever after.

There was also a man by the name Mohamad Bey, a Kurd, of short stature, fat and a long beard. He had met Baha-Wollah when he was living in the Mountain of Sobymanieb and became His ardent follower. When Baha-Wollah returned from the mountains after two years of absence, this Mohamad Bey also came to Bagdad bringing 46 mares for the governor, Ohear Pasha. He was dressed in long flowing robe and had a big turban on his head. Now just think of his strange appearance. Short, fat, long black beard, long Oriental robe and a big turban on his head! After a few days he came to see the Blessed Perfection and lo! there was a complete change in his costume! He was dressed in European clothes but he looked very fantastic {{p20}} while he was sitting in the room with Baha-Wollah talking, Abdul Baha was out standing in front of the house. Suddenly he saw a raging Kurd running from far away toward. On the way he stopped all the pedestrians asking them: Oh Sir! "Where is the house of Darvish Mohamad (this was the name of Baha-Wollah, which he assumed during his two years absence). I will give my life if i could just look into his face!" They directed him to Abdul Baha asking his question with such eagerness, such love, such impatience he took him by the hand and carried him without any notice into the room in which Baha-Wollah was speaking with Mohamad Bey. The whole frame was of the young Turk quivering with the force of {{p21}} love, and his eyes were dazzling with the light of love. When he saw Baha-Wollah, he wept and joyed with such depth of feeling that all the friends wept at the sight of it. It turned out that he was the servant of Mohamad Bey and had this extraordinary love for the Blessed Perfection. Baha-Wollah arose from his seat and made him sit beside his master. Abdul Baha could never forget him as the Turk was sitting there, his eyes like unto two lamps of light ringted upon Baha-Wollah. The Master left us and went upstairs. For dinner he had only a piece {{p22}} of bread and the juice of pomegranate. At nine he took a bath and retired to his room.

Love to all

Ahmad

Dear Harriet!

One of the most interesting events of our Paris sojourn is the arrival of Mirza Jalal, the son-in-law of the Master with Rouha Khanom. Having seen three or four times our beloved brother Mirza Jalal, I was impressed with his dignity, quietness of spirit, deep faith in the Cause and strong assurance. In the Presence of the Master he is always silent, sitting with the utmost politeness. He is thirty four years old and wears European clothes with a black Persian cap on his head. He is rather tall, well built and has large quiet eyes. For thirty years he has lived in Acca, he was only four years old when brought to holy land by his mother, after the martyrdom of his father - "Sutan of the Martyrs" in Esphahan. He remembers Baha-Wollah and for the last thirty years he has watched {{p2}} the Cause grows from step to step. All the Persians love him not only because he is related to the Master but because he is such a faithful believer. Tonight he was invited by Sayad Ahmad Bageroff to dine with us. As the Master was not at the table I asked him to tell me briefly the story of the martyrdom of his father "the Sultan of the Martyrs" and his uncle the "Beloved of the Martyrs".

He said in part: My father was always most fortunate in agricultural undertakings. Under his constant care and attention the soil yielded rich harvests and his fame became widely spread. The chief Pontiff of Esphahan at that time was a great landed proprietor and he had eight villages which needed supervision. He asked my father to rent these villages for a definite amount of money. My father accepted the proposition and for four years manage the affairs most wisely and prudently. Imam Joma (or the chief pontiff) opened an account {{p3}} with my father, drawing checks upon him almost every day. After the end of four years when my father made up the books, he saw the Imam Joma had overdrawn his account to the amount of 45 thousand dollars. The pontiff gave then my father two receipts, one of $30,000 and the other $15,000 to be paid later. One day, as though the same old business relation existed, Imam Joma sent a check with his servant. My father looking the servant that there was no money left, that Imam Joma had overdrawn his account and his impatience tore the check to pieces. The servant returned to his chief and reported what had happened. Although Imam Joma did not say anything yet, secretly he harboured in his heart retaliation and {{p4}} enmity. As my father had two other brothers, one Mirza Hossien and the other Mirza Ismail, they shared together everything they possessed Mirza Ismail not being a Bahai, was mimical to his two brothers. He thought that by giving to the Ulemas and declaring his brothers as Bahais, they would be quickly put out of the way and the path will be clear for him to inherit all the property. So he started to go to Imam Joma and Aga Najafy accusing his brothers as heretics. These two in turn went to the governor of the city and told him that these were two Sayyads in this city who were Bahais and they insisted that they should be summoned and called to court. At that time all the Bahai meetings were held in my father's house and people come and went without any secret; everybody knew that my father was a Bahai. The governor sent for the two brothers and they went to him {{p5}} without premonition. When they arrived he was walking in the garden of his palace known as "Tchehel-Sotoun". He carried a cane in his hand and Aga Najafy was standing before him. The governor addressing my father said that "we have heard you are Bahais". "People say many things", he answered. "Then if you are not Bahais, curse the Cause." "We have seen nothing bad from these people." "Then you are Bahais", and raising his cane and coming near to my father and uncle beat them for several minutes. He called for his servants and commanded them to throw those vile Bahais into the dungeon. Next day the Mullahs clamoured for their blood and after four days of imprisonment {{p6}} they took them out and in the public square, before the eyes of many spectators they are put to death. In the evening a cable was received from the central government in Teheran that they must not kill the two Bahais but it was too late. For two or three days, their bodies were exposed to the public view, then they were entered in "Tatkte-Foulad." During the few days of their imprisonment through the instigation of the Mullahs and the government's authorities, the rabble attacked our house and pillaged everything. Those furnitures that they could not conveniently carry away they destroyed. Their vandalism reached to such a degree that they uprooted the trees and flowers in the garden. At that time I was only six months old and my mother was in that house during those trying days. Then all the {{p7}} property and real state of my father and uncle were divided between the Ulamas and the governor and all of that wealth nothing was left to us! I was four years old when the Command of the Blessed Perfection came that my mother with my brother and sister must leave for Acca. After an eventful journey we arrived in and lived in the vicinity of Baha-Wollah even afterward. Twelve years ago I made a trip to Esphahan, stayed there for a year and two months and then returned again to Acca. The Bahai library collected by my father was unique in all Persia. There one could see many a rare manuscript, many original writings of Baha-Wollah and they all went out of our hands! {{p8}} Now, praise be to God that we are all beneath the overshadowing protection of the Center of the Covenant and all our happiness and joy is centered his good-pleasure. This was just a brief outline of what Mirza Jalal told me tonight.

This morning where we presented ourselves in the Holy Presence of Abdul Baha, he was well and happy and talked about Ferdousi, the great poet of Persia who wrote in poetry the ancient history of that country in his immortal Epic Shah-Nanah. He quoted many lines from that book showing the matchless beauty of the poet eloquence as well as his flight of imagination.

Miss Fraser and Miss Hadjson with bouquets of flowers {{p9}} entered the room. He was writing a Tablet for America with his own hand and as he raised his noble head and saw them with smiles on their faces he exclaimed happily. You are two good sisters. Bahai sisterhood is very precious. It is not like material sisterhood. Material sisterhood is forgotten and often changed into hatred. Material sisters often have not much affection for each other but then sisterhood was eternal, because it was spiritual, Bahai and divine. The greatness of this sisterhood will become more manifest and clear in the worlds of God. There may be a twin sisters in the matrix of the mother but they do not {{p10}} know each other. However when they step into this world, after they have grown, they recognize each other and realize that they have a father and mother and how great and self-sacrificing have been their parent. So when they (Miss Fraser and Miss Hadjson) ascend into the realm of light, they will realize how great was his fatherhood for them. Miss Fraser laughingly said: "I hope we will not have to wait till then", Abdul Baha answered: Here we comprehend things according to our environment and adaptation. This world has not much capacity to conceive the truth. Twin sisters may embrace each other in the matrix and be entirely unconscious of the knowledge of their father and mother. But when they are born into this world theirs will be this deep consciousness.

{{p11}}

Madame Marcovitch a French authoress who has written the life of Gurra-Wollayire in a dramatic play came to see the Beloved. She is a wonderfully intelligent woman and the Master was most kind to her. As she is going to lecture on the "Religious evolution of Persia" before the Theosophists on the 20th of May and bring in the Cause the Master spoke to her in length about the principles of the movement and gave her some of the newspapers and magazines.

He left for Miss Sanderson's house and did not return till late in the evening. All the Persians went to Mr. and Mrs. Scott's {{p12}} meeting at 5 o'clock. Mr. Cobb was there and gave a fine talk on Abdul Baha's trip throughout America. Mon. Bernard spoke in French on "Spiritual man" and at the end I spoke a few minutes and the meeting came to a close with a prayer chanted by Mirza Mahmoud.

The other day Sayad Ahmad Bageroff went downstairs to see the maid to tell her that the Master wanted to take a bath tonight and the water must be very hot. In order to impress her with the importance of the situation he spoke theirs: "Last night I took a bath but the water was cold." "Oh! Je suistres trisle, Monsieur", "Please wait till I finish! Now there was every possibility that I might have caught a cold". {{p13}} "I would gladly come and nursed you back to health", rejoined the obliging maid. "Please! This is very important! I have only one wife and four children. If I caught cold and the worst had happened, somehow they could get along without me." "Poor things! I am glad that nothing happened though." "Tonight Monsieur le Maitre wants to get a bath and the water must be very hot. You know he has millions of sons and daughters all over the world and if he gets the cold you will be blowed." "What! he has millions of sons and daughters! This is extraordinary". That is true though. Now can we {{p14}} depend on you? "For the sake of those millions of children I will do my very best." That night the water was very warm and the Master was also warm in his praise of the maid.

In Persia lived a Bahai athlete, very strong and in teaching the Cause to others he had evolved an argument in the language of sport. He said: "We want a champion who can enter in the diamond - ring - and carry away the palm of victory. He must be the champion of the world. Mohamad Ali has gone into his own room and sitting there boasts of courage and strength. But Abdul Baha is in the diamond ring of America and Europe wrestling with everybody and coming out victorious everywhere. Is this not the test of his supreme courage and invincible power? Is not this enough to convince anybody? This was a fine argument for a sport and he thought many people in this way.

Dear Harriet!

The receipt of three letters today gave much happiness to Abdul Baha, for thy contained good news. One from Miss Juanita M. Storch, Oakland Calif, another from Mother Beecher and the third from Miss Juliet Thompson. The letter from Oakland was much praised by the Master both as regards to its contents and its style. I would like to quote here the part the Beloved loved the best: "Last night when I came home I found the papers you sent me. Words cannot express the happiness I felt. You are the first person to have sent me anything from Paris, and I was so surprised and happy to receive the things I love best. Many people love to receive garments and jewels from Paris and to their eyes if a thing be labelled "Paris", it is best {{p2}} obtainable. But I am so glad that first thing I have had sent to me was the very best. Nothing do I love to obtain more than the teachings of Baha'w'llah. God's garments are never outworn and the brilliancy of his jewels is beyond comparison." The Beloved when heard the last statement said: Bravo! Bravo! This is a most beautiful idea well expressed. Then with enthusiasm in his eyes he said: I have set a conflagration throughout America. Its results will become known later. Wait for a few years and you will behold the appearance of many traces. I do not like to talk about these things for the present because the people cannot understand them but you be patient for a little while and you will see what I have done in America. It took three hundred years for the Cause of Christ to be spread but in the first century the Cause of Baha-ollah will be pragmatic everywhere. We who are so weak are carrying constant conquests while others {{p3}} notwithstanding their greatness and power are being defeated, therefore it is evident that the Confirmations of God are with us.

Mirza Lotfallah Hakim came in and the Master addressing the rest in the room said: We went to London and Mirza Lotfallah served us very faithfully, very sincerely. At this time he is likewise engaged in the Service of the Cause. In this Dispensation those Israelites who have become believers have arisen to serve the Cause with the greatest of steadfastness.

Other Persians arrived and were permitted to go in the Presence of our Beloved. He spoke to them about the lack of administrative capacity and ability amongst the Persian governors and Ministers and {{p4}} how during the last few years instead of devoting their time and energy to the amelioration of the conditions of their country they wasted their precious time over the formation of political parties and in a short while many incongracious parties stalked abroad. What is this? It is the Democratic party. What is that? It is the Conservative party, the Liberal party, and the royalist party, the constitutional party, the republican party, and infunitions. These were only mere word with no meanings behind them. These parties instead of uniting on some general principles divided the people worst than ever and made confusion worst confounded. They could not agree upon anything. Instead of fighting the enemy, they fought amongst themselves and weakened their moral fiber till they have now reached to this deplorable condition.

{{p5}}

At 9:30 the Master in company with Sayad Ahmad Bageroff and myself drove to the hotel of Sepahdar Azam who had just returned from Nice. He came out of his room to welcome the Master and kissed his hands. The Beloved told us to wait in the other room and later he will call us in. For half an hour they were alone together and then we were called in. The Master asked me to translate to Sepahdar Azam the letters of Miss Storch, Miss Thompson and Mother Beecher which I did. Sepahdar listened most carefully and his silence was now and then punctuated with words of praise and surprise. He was {{p6}} most pleased and impressed.

After this he told us the wonderful story of the martyrdom of Badi, the youth who carried the Epistle of Baha-wllah to the Shah of Persia. As he was at the time an eye-witness of this tragic event, it makes it most significant and doubly interesting from a historical standpoint. The Master listened to the recital of the story with the greatest silence; sympathy and love pictured in his glorious Face. Yesterday Sapahdar said, I called on Sardar Mansour and while there I saw a printed copy of the Epistle of Baha-wllah to Nasserd-din Shah. I told those who were present that I have been an eye-witness of the death of Badi and then related to them the whole story as I knew it. Then I brought that Epistle with myself to read it here. Besides this, I wrote with my own hand this story behind a book for Mon. Dreyfus. {{p7}} At the time that this event transpired I was a colonel in the Army and my father had not yet received his title. The Shah had pitched his tents many miles away from Teheran and my father and myself were commissioned to go around the surrounding villages and prepare the commissionist. While we were riding and trying to get ready to go out, we heard a great noise and confusion, servants running to and fro in great consternation. My father asked what is the cause of all these noises. An officer who was coming in from the scene said, that a few minutes ago the Imperial Majesty was driving in the royal carriage when a youth waved a banner towards him. The Shah sent for him several of his {{p8}} bodyguards to find out what he wanted. He told them that he had to see the Shah in person; he had a message to deliver into his hand. At first they searched him, fearing he may attack the Shah with a secret weapon and tried to make him tell the message to them; but he repeated: No, I must see the Shah and give the message to him. The Shah seeing that his bodyguards did not return, sent some more servants to bring them back. What was the reason of your delay? the Shah asked imperiously. "This man", they said desires to deliver a message personally to your Majesty. We tried to get it from him but he would not give it. Bring him then. Badi was brought before the carriage of the Shah. "What is your wish young man?" "I have brought a Firman from the port of my Lord for thee! and he took {{p9}} out immediately the Tablet of Baha-wllah and delivered it into the hand of the Shah. The bodyguards realizing what had happened gathered around Badi and the Shah almost beside himself with anger ordered Kazam Khan to take the young man and force him to give the names of his accomplices. It took the officer hardly a minute to tell us these things when I saw a soldier surrounded by many others, was carrying on his back a young man whose hands and feet were strongly tied with ropes. They were making sport of him that this is the man who had brought a "Firman" for the Shah! Just think of his foolhardiness and audacity to say loudly to the King of Kings that he had brought a "Firman" and not a petition! Hearing this, I did gave no importance to the event {{p10}} and with my father went out to fulfil our duties. On our return, after three days, we were so busy that we did not ask about the Bahai messenger and after 8 days we heard that he was killed. One morning my father told me, let us go and call on Kazam Khan. We started on our way till we reached the door of his tent. He hailed us in and we commented on various events of the Court. Then my father asked Kazam Khan: "What did happen to that young Bahai who had brought a letter from Baha-wllah for the Shah! We heard that he is killed. As you had him in your charge, tell us about it." Really! Kazam Khan answered. It was one of the most marvellous things that has ever transpired, a very marvellous event, almost a miracle! It is an outstanding story. You remember the day he was caught while handing the "Firman of his Lord" to the Shah. Well! His majesty turned him to me with the injunction that {{p11}} I must get out of him the names of his friends. I brought him to my tent and while his hands and feet were tied, I addressed him thus: "Thou art a young, comely youth! Tell me where are thy friends? And I will give you freedom". He answered: My dear Sir! I have no friends! I do not know anyone! I have not even seen the Revelator of the Firman. I am not informed with its contents. The Firman was given me to deliver it into the hands of the Shah! I have not seen anyone either on my way or in Teheran. Now I am most happy that I have fulfilled my duty. I have nothing else to say. I told him: "Young man! Art thou mad? Dost thou not know that this is the sacred Command of his Majesty? If thou dost not reveal the names of thy friends and accomplices in {{p12}} Teheran we will be forced to make thee confess by inflicting upon the severe tortures." He said: "I have already said what I know, whatever punishment you inflict upon me it will be of essence of happiness; the severer the torture the greater my gratitude to you. I am ready." While I was beside myself with rage, I was secretly admiring the calmness and imperturbability of the youth. So I ordered the Farrashes to bring the Bastonadal and putting his feet through it they inflicted a severe beating with fresh branches of the tree upon the sole of his feet. The more they struck the more marvellous was his calmness and poise. He cried not neither did he plead for mercy. Wonder of wonder! he laughed, he sang! Was it possible? It was as though this punishments had no effects upon him! All the Farrashes {{p13}} were by this time tired. I was angry. I was amazed. The fortitude, the patience of this young man stupefied me. Blood flowed from his feet and toes. I jumped out of my seat, got several branches together and continued to beat him as though the demon had possessed me. Great Allah! Again he laughed1 His face was wreathed with smiles! He chanted the songs of praise and glorifications! He cried out. O my God! O my Lord! I thank thee for this great bounty! I praise thee for this most eminent favour! Now I was tired in turn! I could not go any further. I run out of the tent and with consternation in my eyes I presented myself before the Shah! "Your Majesty! There is no use! We have almost killed {{p14}} him under Bastonads but he does not reveal anything. On the contrary! He sings!" "Go!", the Shah said, "he must divulge the names of his accomplices or he will be put to death." I returned to my tent. I ordered my servants to prepare a great fire in the large braziers, and many iron rods and bricks brought in. The rods and bricks were put in the midst of the burning coal till they got as red as fire. Then I addressed Badi: If thou dost not reveal the names of thy friends, thy whole body will be branded with these fiery spikes and bricks. Thou must, beside, confess that thou hast brought a "petition" for the Shah and not a "Firman". I thought that these means of torture will so frighten him that he will confess without any further difficulty. But he astonished me when he said: "I have brought a "Firman" for {{p15}} the Shah and not a "petition". All my life I have been longing for the realization of this day. Whatever torture you heap upon me, you must know of a certainty that it is not torture but it is the greatest of all the divine Gifts. I am ready Sir. Well, we started to brand his breast, his hands, his feet. Yet he did not flinch, he did not show any sign of pain. He was not even perturbed. His face was peaceful his heart was strong. Oh! Merciful Allah! Is there nothing in this world to make this youth suffer? The room was filled with the smoke and the odour of his burning flesh. I could not stand the sight and the smell any longer. I came out for a moment to breathe the fresh air. {{p16}} Going in after a few minutes, in my blind anger I took out of the fire the red hot spike and branded his back and front and run it through his body, here and there. No! He was completely insensible to pains. He did not feel any torture. When the executioners would get tired, lo and behold he would take with his own hand one of the red spikes and put it on his body. Under all these excruciating sufferings he laughed, he was really happy, he chanted some Arabic prayers. We were simply awe-struck! This young man must be invincible, a veritable Rustan! At this juncture the Shah passed by the tent and called for me. "Kazem Khan" the Shah said "has the young man confessed?" "No" I answered "We have {{p17}} inflicted upon him the worst kinds of tortures, but they have made no effect whatever upon him. He does not even condescend to say that he has brought a "petition" for his Majesty; all the time he says "I have brought the Firman from my Lord". Then the Shah said: "He must either tell the names of his friends or he dies." Then I returned again to the tent and ordered the Farrashes to bring a big piece of log. I asked him to put his head on the log which he did willingly. Then I put a heavy bludgeon in the hand of one of the Farrashes, told him to raise it in the air and stand over his head. Then I addressed him: Young man {{p18}} if thou dost not desire to divulge the names of thy friends, all right; at least say I have brought a "petition" for his Majesty and not a Firman. Then thou will be made free. "Free!" in exasperation he cried out. "Do not talk to me about freedom! I am free, I am the freest man in the world." All my life I have been yearning for this day, for this hour. Now that this Chalice of divine felicity is made ready, it is not unjust that I may heedlessly let it pass by without drinking it! I tell you Sir, for the last time thou I have brought the "Firman of my Lord and not a petition". Then I made a sign to the man with his raised mace to do his work and with the first and second strike his head was splintered and life flew out of {{p19}} his body. A report of what transpired was submitted to the Shah and he in turn commanded me to bury his remains secretly which I did that very hour. Such was the story of the Martyrdom of Badi as related to my father and myself by Kazem Khan himself after eight days of acts of superhuman tortures. One of the strangest things, however is that Kazem Khan and his whole family were entirely destroyed afterwards and no trace of them is left in Persia. This was the wonderful story of the martyrdom of Badi as heard by me today related by Sepahdar Azam {{p20}} before our Beloved. Truly I say, I would travelled from America to Paris just to hear this story from the lips of a nobleman of Persia such as Sepahdar Azam!

After drinking tea and talking other topics the Master arose to depart. Rest thou assured he told him as his parting words, "that God will confirm and assist thee and as a sign of this, I will kiss both thy cheeks." Sepahdar likewise kissed the Blessed hands of the Beloved.

Coming out of the hotel a taxi cab was hired and a ride in the Bais was taken. On reaching a very large lake over which hundreds of ducks were riding gorgeously the Master came out and walked around it. Many trees in white blooms attracted his {{p21}} attention. Sayad Ahmad said it will be well if every day the Master could come out in the Park and inhale the breeze. He answered: Our air consists of the Breeze of the Providence of His Holiness Baha-wllah. If it wafts from the direction of Mercy, we are stirred with happiness; if not, not.

He stopped at Miss Sanderson to meet his daughter for awhile then he called on Mon. and Madame Dreyfus and come back to the hotel about three to meet Foad Effendi and a Frenchman. The Beloved spoke to them on the prophecies of the Holy Books concerning this day and how all the nations are expecting the coming of a promised one. In closing {{p22}} he told the Frenchman that the beginning of this movement is like the commencement of the Christian Dispensation. Just as they gave no importance to Christian Movement, in the same manner they may not give due importance to the Bahai Cause but its greatness become known later on.

At five o'clock, Mr. Cobb with other young American students came to see the Master. They were excellent men at the prime age. The Beloved welcomed them most cordially. One of them said that they have heard much about the Bahai Movement from Mr. Cobb and they think it a great privilege to find themselves in the Presence of Abdul Baha. Abdul Baha said that he was likewise most pleased to meet them, that this Cause has become worldwide. In a short space of time it has permeated throughout all the regions {{p23}} for it has a magnetic power which attracts all the intelligent men and women toward its center. Were a person be informed with the reality of this Cause he would believe in it; for these teachings are the Spirit of this age. The Bahai Movement imparts life. It is the Cause of love and amity amongst mankind. It establishes communication between various religions and different nations. It removes all out agonism. Therefore when this Cause is full, spread in Europe, warfare will be a thing of the past, universal Peace will be realized, the oneness of the world of humanity will be practised, religion and science will work hand in hand. Then these various human families will become one family. There will remain {{p24}} no racial distinction such as French, English, American, German, Arab, Turk and Persian. They will become all one. The Bahai Movement bestows upon man a new spirit, a new light and a new motion. It enlarges the sphere of thought. It illumines the horizon of the intellect. It expands the arena of comprehension. This world is like unto an egg. As long as man lives within the shell of the egg he cannot soar heaven word. All the nostrils are afflicted with cold and they cannot inhale the sweet fragrances. All the eyes are blind and they cannot see the rays of the sun of Reality. In brief, the Master talked at length about the intellectual and spiritual powers {{p25}} latent in man and in what manner was man enabled to bring under his contract all the phenomena of nature through this god-given power and how through this heavenly power Divine Avilization will be established. After the meetings they asked questions and received satisfactory answers. Then tea was served and when they left the Master they were all inspired with the noblest ideals of brotherhood. His last words to them was "I hope each one of you be as luminous as this electric light" and unconsciously they all turned their eyes and looked at the globe of light!

Dear Harriet!

For the last few days the Master had been able to devote one hour every morning to answering the letters which were pouring in from every direction. These hours were and were will ever be to me the most saved and the most beautiful. It was never later than 6am when I found myself with him alone in his room. It was the hour of the revelation of Teachings and the descent of Manna from heaven. I had my penal and paper ready and then the Nightingale of the Holy-Spirit sung in celestial harmonies and divine melodies. he touched all the invisible keys of spiritual music, his voice changing to the unseen chords of life. Now he sung a note of consolation; then he struck a key of authority; again he soared toward the imperial realm of Light bringing back to us the glorious possibilities of divine Civilization. As he revealed the Tablets he either sat in a chair, wrap up in divine contemplation, with his eyes shut or he walked back and forth impelled by the power of the Holy-Spirit. The words of light and life flowed from his silvery lips like a rushing river; for the parched ground of humanity was ready to be irrigated with this pure water which was descending like unto the torrent from the Mountains of God. For one hour or more without being disturbed by anyone the Beloved dictated these Tablets to various parts of the world and at every instance showing his foresight, wisdom, knowledge and perseverance. 

{{p2}}

Then he took my writing and went over every Tablet correcting or adding a few words here and there with his own blessed hand. Then he gave them to Mirza Mahmoud to copy them. When they were ready he turned them to me. I translated them into English and took them to him to be mailed. The Beloved would read again every Tablet and if any word was left out he added it with his own hand or called Mirza Mahmoud to do it the same addition or correction to be made by me in the translation. Then he sealed with his signet ring the upper right corner of the Tablet and signed the lower left hand both in English and Persian. Then with his own hands he closed the evelope ready to be mailed either by one of the secretaries or myself. The Tablet for the East are taken by Mirza Mahmoud right to the Master and after going through the same process- of course without any English signatures- they are given by the Beloved to Sayad Assadullah to mail them to their various destinations.

At 8:30 this morning several young French men came and had an interview with the Beloved on philosophy and religion. Then he went out with Food Effendi to Miss Sanderson. Two interesting things that I heard today were first the story of the daily life of Baha-Ullah from Mirza Jalal and the personal experiences of Doctor Ahmad Khan who had come from London to see the Master. This latter is a Bahai and has made years of study in Arabic and Persian literatures and graduated from Parisian and London schools. He is very intelligent and learned. When he was eight years old, his father being a Bahai, made him memorize long Tablets of Baha-Ullah and Abdul Baha. He did not know what they were but his memory was so extraordinary that he could recite for hours. For several years he studied Arabic, law etc in Mohamadan Universities and at the age of fourteen he was graduated as a prodigy ; one of his difficult mental recreations being to recite from the end to the beginning of a poem containing one thousand verses in Arabic. Then he comes to Paris and after three years of study went to London. He has been there for three years pursuing.

Dear Harriet!

The fall of Adrianople and the tragic cyclone and hurricane in Ohio and Indiana with their direful consequent results have saddened the heart of the Beloved of the world. His heart weeps over the sufferings of our brothers and sisters both in America and in the Orient. You can never realize how sad and sorry he was over the terrific disaster and deluge which we read is appealing in the history of America since the foundation of Republic. If his own country was stormed with a calamity like unto this he could not feel more sad. Oh! It is dreadful and heart-breaking to read the news in the New York Herald and other French newspaper of the perfectly diabolic devastation by the general overflow of the waters and the breaking of reservoirs; the famine, the cold and impossibilities of sending relief. This morning in his room he prayed for the sufferers. His heart was swelling with sympathy and although he was far away from the scenes of destruction yet it was as though he was in their midst. 

As regards to the fall of Adrianople into the hands of the Bulgars the Master said: Fifty years ago Baha-Ullah prophesized: Adrianople shall go out of the hand of the Sultan and today that prophecy is fulfilled. This is one of the greatest proofs of the Blessed Perfection .what all the prophecies that he has made concerning the future events have come to pass. Yet people are sleep and do not comprehend the wonders of this Revelation.

A few Persians came in to see him and the surrender of Constanipole was discussed. The Beloved said: It is evident that negligence from God brings a nation to this path; lack of sound administration throws people into such defeats. If the Turks were watchful of their interests, a thousand years may have passed without losing any of their domains. But they were sleep and spent their times in the pursuit of pleasures. They were steeped in the sea of self. They never thought of the preservation of the rights of their Motherland.

{{p2}}

Madame Scott with an American woman and her 7 year-old boy were led into his Presence. As soon as the boy came in, the Master called to him and taking him in arms hugged him close to his breast and kissed him many times. His mother was very happy to see the Master showering so much love upon her boy and she wept the tears of joy. Then he took from the mantel piece two oranges and gave them to the child, he also filled his two pockets with almonds. It was a very lovely right to see the Beloved stooping down to the size of the child and filling his pockets. He told the mother to give a good education to her son and speak with him always about God so that his eyes may behold the rays of the Sun of Reality and his ears may hearken the melody of the Supreme Concourse.

{{p3}}

After this he went out to Miss Sanderson returning several times each time to meet some people who had gathered here. According to what I hear we will be leaving soon for Stuttgard but nothing definite yes. The German Bahais are waiting patiently. They have been disappointed so many times. 

I hear that an operation will be performed on the Master's daughter's throat. The specialists have discovered the source of her sickness and have assured us that she will get well after the operation.

{{p4}}

The Master ate today with us at the table. He had invited Doctor Ahmad Khan and a few others to dine with him and he spoke at length on the majesty and glory of Baha-Ullah even when in the prison of Acca . Right after his rest he went to Miss Sanderson and we did not see him till 9 o'clock. He came home at night with Food Effendi and cooking in his own room some eggs we had supper with him. At that hour Mon. and Madame Dreyfus came in and stayed a long time, the Master reading to them as he read to us in the afternoon some of the funny and fantastic writings of Subhe Azal. These writings are all childish and full of mistakes and meaningless.

Dear Harriet!

It is now nearly four months that Abdul Baha has left the "new world" carrying with himself the fresh Breeze of the Kingdom of Abha, diffusing everywhere the Fragrances of the Rose garden of Reality, singing the rapturous melodies of the angelic spheres, playing divinely on the lyre of the Supreme Concourse, heralding the glad-tidings of the dawn of the sun of universal Religion, promulgating the underlying principles of the heavenly Faiths, spreading the effective Breaths of the Holy-Spirit, teaching the doctrine of spiritual brotherhood, unveiling the Beauty of then Love of God, interpreting the life of selflessness and sanctification, unfolding the path of the knowledge of God, preparing the highway of humanity, painting out the exalted destiny of the children of man and expounding the lofty ideal of the solidarity of human race and the fundamental unity of all phenomenon. Throughout all his private and public talks he has struck one divine note: One people. One nation. One language. One religion. One Faith. One Brotherhood. This is the age of unity and the drawing together of the nations of the earth. This is the country of the manifestation of the heavenly radiance. This is the day of God. This is the period of the Lord of Mankind. This is the Dispensation of Spiritual love. We must forget our prejudices. We must work for the Cause of universal Peace. We must serve our fellow men, irrespective of sect or nationality. We must practice charity and loving kindness. We must overlook the faults of others. We must gird up the loin endeavor and exert ourselves so that this dark world may become illumined, the satanic characters may become angelic and the earthly souls may be transformed into heavenly beings.

This morning the news of American cyclone and flood again made him sad and I read to hi the dispatches giving the description of the tragic events and the appalling loss of life he face was the embodiment of divine sympathy and spiritual consolation. Then he asked Mirza Mahmoud to chants the prayers of Baha-Ullah in behalf of these departed ones. As he chanted the wonderful communes of the Blessed Perfection, all of us prayed from our hearts and souls for America at this hour of her misfortune and suffering! When the prayer was finished the Beloved as though coming from the world of light said: Although outwardly these cataclysmal disaster are hard to bear yet inwardly there lies a great wisdom behind them which will appear later. All the visible, material events are inter-related with invisible, spiritual forces. The infinite phenomena of creation are interdependent with each other as the many links in a chain. When certain links become rusty they are broken by unseen forces to be replaced by newer and better ones. On the other hand, there are certain colossal events which transpire in the world of humanity, which colossal events are required by the nature of the time. For example, the requirement of winter, snow, storm, hail, rain etc. We cannot call a winter a winter unless these events do come to pass. But the birds or the animals whose span of life is only for six months or a year cannot realize the wisdom of the winter; they chide and lament and are discontented. They raise a howl saying: Why this winter? Why this awful frost? Why this hail and storm? Why not the balmy weather? Why not eternal spring time? Why this injustice on the part of the Creator? Why this suffering? What have we done to be meted out with this catastrophe? However those souls who have lined many years and have had much experiences and weathered many severe winters, they realize that in order to enjoy the coming spring they must have this cold winter. The bird living only this month does not know there is a spring. Man alone knows that after every hard winter, the spring with its thousand vary-colored flowers will bloom forth. After the velocity of the gale the soul-refreshing breeze will waft. After the sterility and apparent death; fertility and life will manifest. After the hurricane and storm, quietness and calmness will reign. After the silence of the birds in winter they will all break forth into joyous songs of spring. Now the wisdom of this American disaster is not known to the many people of this generation, because they are too much absorbed in the immediate sufferings and hardships that it has brought in its train. When the flood is subside and people shake off the temporary gloom, they will then realize that after this destruction, there is construction; after this suffering there will be blessing; after this death there will be life; after this darkness there will be light; after this loss there will be profit; after this devastation there will be up building; after this havoc there will be prosperity; after this failure there will be success and after this war of elements there will be glorious peace and greater civilization.

Mr. E.W. Moore an American, the cousin of Doctor Moody arrived from London on his way to Budapest and had an interview with the Beloved. He is a merchant in Budapest and has been there for the last five years. He has become interested in the Movement through Doctor Moody and has become a Bahai on account of the teaching of universal language and universal religion because in Budapest alone there is a babel of languages and religions and people always quarreling over these petty misunderstandings. The Master told him: These Bahai teachings were for the unification of the human race, and the freedom of man from superstitions. He hoped he will become the cause of the illumination of the city of Budapest. He saw in Mr. Moore's face the light of reality and this was the sign of the purity of his heart. In this day the world of humanity was very dark. Warfare was destroying the foundation of man's edifice and the false ideas of patriotism, as taught on the leaders of nations today did more harm to the body politic than anything else. He must make the utmost effort so that this hatred be abolished from amongst the people.

Abdul Baha said that he loved Doctor Moody very much. she was a sincere believer, assured and faithful. In Teheran she was very happy amongst the friends of God and she was serving the people and the cause most whole-heartedly.

{{p4}}

Mr. Moore asked about the probable visit of the Master to Budapest. He did not give any definite answer. He was not yet decided whether Budapest and Vienna will be included in his itinerary. I gave him the address of one of the friends in Budapest to go and call on him on his arrival. When the time of departure come the Master kissed his two cheeks and showed him much love.

Mrs. Hieston in whose apart, the Master spoke a few weeks ago was ushered into the room of the Beloved. She was disturbed about her affairs in America and begged him to pray for her.

{{p5}}

Speaking about his long stay in Paris the Master said: We are now caught here. We do not like to stay one day longer but so many events have come up all the time to postpone our departure. He said that his spirit was not at ease here, otherwise all the means of physical comfort were present. The unrest of the spirit was a thousand times worse than the unrest of the body. If a person passed by a city or town and whaled the Fragrances of the Merciful from the whalictants he might stay for sometimes there, even if it was a small place. Many other people came to see him and he received all with gentleness, love and spiritual courtesy.

{{p6}}

About 11 o'clock he went to Miss Sanderson to look over the final arrangements of transferring Rouhanieh Khanom to a hospital or "Maison de Saute" when the operation will be made. she was taken to the hospital toward the evening and immediately the Master went to see how she was situated . The operation will be made tomorrow morning and she may have to stay there from two week to three weeks.

He returned for lunch to our place. Miss Hodgson and Miss Fraser and Madame D'Astre were at the table. Mirza Jalal also will stay at this hotel during the time that Rouhanieh Khanom will be at the "Maison de Saute".

{{p7}}

In the afternoon a French poet come to see the Master and he spoke to him thus: Man must spend his talent in a cause the result of which was eternal. If we spent our talent in the cause of God its outcome will be everlasting, but if we waste it over worldly affairs, it was like drawing pictures over the surface of the water. For example if he wrote a book, it may perpetuate his name for a thousand or 2000 years and it will be forgotten afterwards. But if he breathed one breath in the path of God, it will immortalize him through him throughout ages and cycles. If he composed a poem or wrote a book on the Cause of God they will bring forth eternal fruits. Therefore man must devote his talents to such causes which spell service to the Kingdom of God. Consequently let him consecrate his poetic imagination to the cause of God. The end of all these undertaking that you observe is ruin except service to the Kingdom of Abha. Every building that man construct will be destroyed some day except the palace of the cause of God. The palace built by Christ is and will ever be indestructible, likewise the mansions of his apostles. Now Abdul Baha desired that he may likewise lay the foundation of such a palace which will stand the attack of the accidents of all time. He was sure that God will confirm and assist him.

{{p8}}

Miss Beatrice Irwin visited the Beloved and he told her that she was good Bahai that in reality her heart was attracted toward God and her whole desire was to serve the Cause of God. The first day that he met her he observed in her face the signs of the love of God and he prayed in her behalf. From God he begged for her assistance and confirmation so that in the city of Paris she may become a green tree whose fruits may be enjoyed by all the people; that she may become a fragrant flower whose perfume may be inhaled by all the nostrils; that she may obtain an illumined heart and a spirit rejoiced with divine glad-tidings and that she may arise to serve the Cause of God with the power of sanctity and holiness.

{{p9}}

After meeting a few important Persians and discussing with them the fall of Adrianople as prophesied by Baha-Ullah fifty years ago, Mr. Cobb and a Turkish friend arrived. The Master spoke at length on the peculiar Sect of Baktashi, pointing out their two distinctive dispositions. One being on friendly term with all the people and religions and the other harboring no prejudices against any religion. Then he spoke on the uninterrupted descent of the Grace of God, that there was no suspension in his bounty, that he has ever been the Creator and has always sent his prophets.

{{p10}}

Mr. Cobb asked whether there will be any clergy in the Bahai Cause? Immediately the Beloved said: No. And continued: in this movement there will never be any paid ministers, no appointed clergy, no bishops, no cardinals, no popes, no ceremonies. A clergy, assuming that he is ordain to his ministry thinks that he knows more about God, while in reality the humble unordained man in his congregation or in the street may know more. The sacerdotal and theological position makes many a clergy proud and haughty! But there is one thing in this cause. Some people may become greater than the rest not through appointment but through the purity of their hearts, their unselfish deeds, their heroic sacrifices and their knowledge of God. Such illumined souls like unto the kind fathers or teachers will guide and teach those less fortunate. They are the elder brothers of the members of the community. They do not arrogate unto themselves any title or any position. You will know them by their humility, sincerity, deeds, severance, knowledge spirituality and attraction.

{{p11}}

Another question was asked by someone present about marriage relations, whether there will be any modifications. He said that there are two relations between man and wife, one real, the other unreal. The real relation which is based upon spiritual love and companionship will ever remain the same; the other relation which is unreal will be done away with. The love between man and wife must ever be kept sacred and holy. Marriage was necessary. It was a command of God. Humanity was continued through the practice of this law but the life in the family must loved as an art soul-elevating so that the children may breath the uncontaminated atmosphere of joy and the love of their parent may be a great example to them.

Someone asked about divorce. He said that when there exists incompatibility of temblor and complete antipathy between the man and wife, then divorce was permitted. For if they live together under such stifling conditions it will be worse than hell.

{{p12}}

Another person asked about the future of the science of aviation and the master promptly answered: The science of aviation will make great progress in the immediate future and people will travel at ease from one city to another without any danger. Aeroplanes will become as popular as automobiles. Just as now every well to do person has an automobile then he will have an aeroplane. Although for the present it is not yet perfected but ere long it will be within the reach of everyone to have a ride through the air.

{{p13}}

The Beloved went out with Doctor Mohamad Khan to call on Ahmad Pasha. Mirza Lotfollah and myself took a walk as far as the other side of Eiffel Tower. I have been so busy that for the last few days I have not been out of the hotel so this half an hour walk turned me up. It is wonderful how the spirit and the Presence of the Master keep one working for hours without feeling any fatigue.

the news of the Cause from the Orient are inspiring. Hundreds of letters are received from all parts of the world giving the news of the progress of the Cause and the attraction of the Souls to the Kingdom of Abha.

Dear Harriet!

I may just as well began this day with a few quotations from the recent utterances of Our Beloved:

##On Universal Religion

"Praise be to God that the Sun of Universal Religion hath dawned. From all parts of the world host after host enter under its Radiance. Ere long it will become worldwide."

{{p2}}

##On Universal Patriotism

"Every high-soaring bird does not attach its heart to its low nest and abode. At every morn it sings a new melody in a rose-garden and at every eve it warbles the strains of Divine mysteries in a new meadow. At one time it rises above the summit of the green mountains and again it flies spreading its imperial wings over deserts and plains. Now it breaks into ideal harmonies and again chanting sweetly the secrets of God. It does not wish home and comfort nor seek after nest and abode. It is intoxicated with the wine of the Love of God, singing at all time the anthems and praises of the Almighty. This is the custom of the heavenly birds. This is the manner and conduct of the nightingales of the rose-garden of the Merciful."


{{p3}}

##On the Covenant

"Today firmness in the Covenant is the means of the promotion of the word of God and conducive to the effect of the word of the teacher."

{{p4}}

##On spreading the Cause

"Today whosoever arises to herald the Kingdom of Abha, a magnetic power will be produced which shall attract the rays of Confirmation; the hosts of the Supreme Concourse will make him victorious and the power of the Holy Spirit will support and assist him."

{{p5}}

##On the Ministers of the Church

"In this world millions of Ministers have been ordained but the majority of them have been useless and atrophied organs. They left behind neither a fruit nor a trace except living a few limited days, walking in the paths of their own egos and gratification of their own desires and at last bidding farewell to this ephemeral world, leaving behind no trace. But praise be to God that thou art confirmed, thou hearkened to the Call of the Kingdom, thou art informed with the teachings of Baha-Ullah, the doors of the Kingdom are opened before Thy face and Eternal Life hath become manifest. Therefore strive that in this world and in the world of the Kingdom, thou mayst deposit a treasury and leave behind a trace and a result; so that day unto day thou mayst become more favored in the divine Threshold and be classed as one of the most faithful and sincere servants if His Holiness Baha-Ullah."

{{p6}}

##Spiritual Discovery

"I beg of God that thou mayst discover the stars of the Kingdom of Abha, behold the zodiacal towers on the world on High, unfold the secrets of God and worship a Sun which never sets in the horizon and its rays are the mysteries of phenomena."

{{p7}}

This morning the Master called me very early. As I entered in his holy presence I saw him sitting on the floor praying at the Threshold of the Almighty. He asked me about Mon. Dreyfus' meeting last night. I answered that a large number of people were present and eagerly inquired about his health and were disappointed not to see him. Mon. Dreyfus read paragraph from the words of Paradise and elucidating them as he went along. Then Mr. Cobb gave a most instructive talk on how he became a Bahai, how he found the position of Ministry untenable for which position he was fitting himself in Horward Divinity College. "Imagine" he said "a young man without any experience in life but simply because he was graduated from a theological seminary, rises in the pulpit before a large audience in the church, the majority of the members of which are much older and have had more experiences in life and tries to tell them how to live such a position in this enlightened age is to say the least, not very enviable. Then I thought I will write to Abdul Baha and ask his advice. He wrote me back 'it is much better if you can gain your livelihood through another source'".

{{p8}}

The Beloved called other Persians and after drinking tea he spoke to us with much animations against habitual gambling and drinking reciting the stories of men who have wrecked their lives through such evil practices. He said that praise be to God we have no such things in this Cause. It is pure and entirely free from these blemishes.

{{p9}}

A few people came to see him. We asked about his health. He said: I am under the protection and preservation of God. God looks after me. He guards me against any danger. Sometimes he comes and caresses me. He kisses my lips and touches my back. He talks with me in the midnight and wakes me in the morning. Throughout the cities and over the seas, in the mountains and valleys God has been my close companion and intimate friend. In the time loneliness he consoles me. When I am alone He calls me by my name. He has never forgotten me and will never forget me. He is my faithful friend. His friendship sustains me. His love inspires me. His tenderness watches over me and His affection hovers like unto a white dove around me.

{{p10}}

Miss Fraser going into his divine presence asked whether the manifestation of God was ever sad? The Master said: Yes! But his sadness did not come from anything belonging to himself. He desired to make a many illumined but more preferred darkness; this made the manifestation sad. He wished to change the ignorance of the people into knowledge; their error into guidance; their insincerity into sincerity; their faithlessness into faithfulness, but people preferred the latter qualities and so the manifestation of God was made sad and unhappy over the heedleness and negligence of those sleepy "souls".

{{p11}}

She asked: "Will the Master visit again America?" He said that if much result were witnessed as the outcome of his first trip, if many harvests were gathered after the first sowing of the seeds then, God willing he will go.

{{p12}}

Madame Sacy and her three daughters came to see the Beloved. He was most kind to them. He said that he loved Mon. Sacy and he loved all his family. They are considered as his own family. In the future their grandchildren will glorify because they belonged to a family, the first one of which harbored the Love of Baha-Ullah in his heart. Addressing the eldest girl he said: He saw already her children glorifying in this. She could not see now but he saw them. To each, he gave a gold piece as souvenirs. They left his heavenly presence with their hearts overflowing with love.

{{p13}}

Four other ladies arrived. They have lived in London for many years and know Lady Bloomfield well. The Beloved received them with his heavenly courtesy and opened his remarks by saying: So they were the friends of Lady Bloomfield. No doubt she had informed them with these teachings. he loved Lady Bloomfield very much because all her efforts were directed toward spreading the glad-tidings of the Kingdom. She had no other thought outside the Kingdom of God and she will be very much blessed. He hoped they will become informed of the Mysteries of the Love of God. These heavenly possibilities he desired for them.

{{p14}}

One asked how should they come into closer relation with God? The Master answered: Any soul entering the Kingdom of Baha-Ullah will enjoy an eternal communism with God. It was his hope that each one of they become thirsty for the water of Reality. May they become hungry for the Bread of the Kingdom! It was in this instance that His Holiness Christ said: He that drinketh of this water shall never thirst! This means the infinite Bestowels of God, the virtues of the Divine world, the perfections of the world of humanity and the ideals of the heavenly realm. May they receive day unto day these bounties. May they draw nearer unto God day unto day! May they be submerged in the sea of these iridescent lights! May they be characterized with these praiseworthy virtues! This is the ultimate result of human life! This is the fruit of existence! This is the brilliant pearl of cosmic consciousness! This is the shining star of spiritual destiny!

{{p15}}

To another person he said: Did she say that she was from England? In reality we are all one nation - England. France, Germany, Persia, America, they are all one country. However, thus much can be said. It often happened that the inhabitants of a given country were more receptive to truth than other parts. Since we have arrived in France, there has been much interest in the Bahai Cause but not as much as in England or in America. While in London many people were attracted and large meetings were organized. The English people were sincere, truth-loving, determined and seekers of reality. They were thirsty after knowledge. They explored the furthest ends of the earth in order to throw light upon puzzling problems . They were a determined, persevering nation. They were enterprising and investigators of reality. In the immediate future, much interest will be aroused in France about the Bahai Cause. They will see that there were so many Bahais in other parts and they will follow their example.

He was most pleased to have met all of them. He will pray in this behalf that the heavenly powers may descend upon them, that each one of them may come under the guidance of God.

{{p16}}

He took his lunch in the general dining room. The dishes were prepared especially by the household of one of the Turkish Pasha residing now in Paris and sent for him. He was sleep yet when at the kind invitation of Miss Fraser and with the permission of the Master, seven of the Persians with Miss Hodgson and herself sailed out on the sight-seeing tour in a Cook and Sons automobile. The car took us through the principal streets and oversees, the guide pointing out each historical building or church, telling us in what century they have been built etc. We visited several buildings and churches and Pantheon. I admired very much the large windows of a church constructed in the 13th century. They were remarkable for their beauty, combination of colors. It was about half past five when we returned home, our minds becoming a little store houses of pleas and memories. On our way the car stopped at a famous cafe for several minutes and again Miss Fraser insists that we must drink a cup of tea. The Persians were most grateful to her in giving them such a lovely recreation and sight-seeing experience which could not be done without her gentle and loving hospitality.

Coming home we met the Master just arrived from the "Mansion de Saute", praying a visit to Rouha Khanom who was rapidly recovering from the effect of operation on her thirst.

{{p17}}

One of the birds of England in writing a letter to the Master and expressing his pleasure in seeing him while in London makes the following significant remark:

"I believe the religion you teach and practice will be the foundation of future universal Faith; for people must come to learn that the Kingdom of God is amongst them."

Love to all.

Ahmad

Dear Harriet!

Miss Beatrice Irwin, our new English Bahai who has been staying in Paris during the last month has composed a lovely poem called "New years greeting's for our Persian sisters dedicated to Nou Rouz March 21st 1913". It is as follows:

>>"Beloved sisters in the rose garden of Persia, 
On this, the first day of the year, we send greetings!
Spiritual light and fragrance has come to us from your land,
The New Moon of a new faith, floats above the ocean of truth across whose depths
It lays a silver path,
On which our souls are thronging joyous by toward you,
No longer do seas and continents divide us,
The white winged messenger of unity and
Peace has alighted in our midst,
And we speed back that message tinged
With the dawn of our awakening,
Anointed with attar of our thanksgiving!
O sisters! In the throne-room of the Sun,
You whose beauty has cast a spell across the centuries,
For you as for us a new day is dawning.
At the altar of love, let us meet and clasp hands,
And lay therein the lamp of burning
And the rose of faith,
Interwoven as blossoms in one garland,
Be our prayers of gratitude.
For the freedom that is coming to us
Daily in fuller measure,
As we realize the inner meaning of this divine message of Unity,
That rids us of limitations of casts, creed, distance and education.
This message that merges the music of a myriad waves
Into one echo of the blessed name!
Beloved sisters! A new moon floats above the ocean of truth,
Oh! By the guidance of its light
Tearless, may we fare forth!"<<

Today Mirza Davoud Youhanna of London, the translator of the mysterious forces of civilization arrived and immediately had a long interview with the Beloved. He inquired about the health of all the friends in London. Referring to the spread of the Cause in London he said: The enjoyment of the world of humanity comes through spiritual Bestowals and not material luxuries. When he was in London he was very happy because the people were receptive and investigators of reality.

{{p3}}

The two points about which the Master talked with the Persians under various forms in these days were the fall of Adrianople and the predictions of Baha-Ullah fifty years ago as well as the fantastic and entirely meaningless writings of Sobhi Azul. The extracts he read are taken from the books of Subhi Azul, now catalogued in the British museum. They are supposed to be in Arabic but so full of mistakes, so overflowing with repetitions that are really ridiculous. I wonder how the man could ever write such rubbish. I tried to translate one line of it and I found it is impossible because the words have no meaning at all. A madman in an insane asylum speaks much more coherently and consentingly. Mirza Dawound is a very intelligent, lovely Bahai, full of connection and sweetness. He has studied a great deal and has served and is now serving the Cause very efficiently in London. The Master also loves him very much. He is going to bring a number of his friends tomorrow to see the Beloved.

Being Sunday many people came to blessed by the Master. Amongst them there was a Frenchman of unusual attainment and capacity. When he entered the room the Beloved was writing. He raised his noble head and welcomed the newcomer. He told him that: Just as that moment he was thinking of him. He was most welcomed. Let him be happy for he has heard the Call of the Kingdom of Abha. This is indeed a great privilege! Its importance is not known at this time. It will become evident in the future. The Apostles of Christ attained to the greatest station in life, yet they were vilified and scorned in their days because they were followers of the humble Nazarene and thus considered as the most despised and ignorant! But now the brilliant lights of their stations have flooded the whole world with knowledge and wisdom. Each one of the Apostles is shining like unto a star from the horizon of Eternal Glory. Now it has become evident to what a glorious station they reached in their own days! Likewise no one can adequately express the greatness of the station of the friends of God in their Dispensation. The glorious possibilities of this station will become manifest in the future. It is Abdul Baha's hope that in Paris the Frenchmen may become ignited like unto a candle and arouse the people with the Call of God- so that in reality they may become Bahais and practice the Teachings of Baha-Ullah. He was made most happy to have seen him because in his face he saw the light of the Love of Baha-Ullah! He will give him a ring over which the name of the Blessed Perfection is engraved. He loved him very much. Later the greatness of Abdul Baha's love for him will become clear. He expected to hear good news from him that his heart is so illumined and that he has guided many souls in Paris.

Two other Bahais entered in his Presence. He told them: They must become fully informed with these Teachings. It was very good to be thoroughly informed with science or arts or literature likewise they must be established in the Kingdom of God. The results of material sciences were limited. They train only the physical man. That is why His Holiness Christ said: Love thy net. Come and I will make thee the fisher of man. The results of the divine science, the guidance of God, the spiritual Arts are unlimited and train the real man. His spirit communicates with them. It annihilates space and time. There are some believers in Persia with whom his spirit always speaks but he has never seen them.

Another friend just arrived from London! At her entrance the Master exclaimed! Oh! She was here? She was very welcome! How was she? How were the friends in London? Did she meet them? Were they happy? Were they spreading the glad-tidings of the Kingdom? Were their tongues engaged in the Commemoration of God? Were they full of zeal? Did they comfort the unhappy ones? Did they raise the fallen? Were they kind to all the people of the world? Did they serve the Cause of universal Peace and good will amongst nations? Did they sympathize with the fortunate? Were they the stars of the heaven of Baha? Were they the weaves of the Most Great Sea? Were they illumining the dark path of the travelers? Were they the bright torches of Reality? When she is returning to London let her convey to them his longing and greeting and tell them that Abdul Baha loves those friends of God for they are faithful Bahais; they are from in the Covenant; they are the sincere servants of His Highness Baha-Ullah; they are calling the people to the Kingdom of God. Abdul Baha was extremely pleased with them. They must not rest by day and by night! They must strive to illumine the hearts children of men! Awaken the souls! This is not the day of silence! This is not the day of rest! Each one of them in this day must become a crier of the Kingdom of Abha a herald of the glad-tidings of the Supreme Concourse. Each one must become attracted and enkindled! God willing the Confirmations of God shall descend upon the uninterruptedly. He shall never forget them and will ever pray for them.

The Beloved took his lunch with us, He spoke few words at the table. In the afternoon Persians, Americans and Parisians came one after another and the table of spiritual Feast was spread, each person eating according to his hunger. At five o'clock Sapahdor called and a long discussion was followed on the subject of the fall of Adrianople and Persian problem. Abdul Baha said that 50 years ago a journalist wrote an article ridiculing the Cause, saying, this God of Acca had predicted the fall of Adrianople, while in reality the Forts of that city are impregnable. Where is that journalist now come and see how this prophecy was fulfilled.

The Master in company with Mirza Jalal, Doctor Mohamad Khan and Food Effendi went to call on Rouha Khanom in the "Maison de Saute'" and from there he called on Mon. and Madame Dreyfus and arrived at the hotel about 9:30. He took his dinner in his own room.

{{p8}}

Mirza Dawood Youhanna had brought the copy of a Tablet to Haji Ameen which was revealed by Abdul Baha when he left Paris for Persia. It's original was in the Master's own handwriting. It is a very wonderful Tablet and I will close this day's communique with its translation.

He is the Mighty! The Powerful! O thou Ameen of the Blessed Perfection! Praise be to God that thou host covered the long distance and become my companion and associate in London and Paris. Many a night and day we spoke together and commemorated the mention of His Highness the Friend and the remembrance of the believers of God. The praises of the beloved ones were constantly upon our tongues and conducive to the joy and the fragrance of this Exiled on our mountains and plains and the Wanderer and Traveler over the lands and seas. Praise be to God that all the friends are the fragrant, laughing hundred-petalled roses in the garden of the Love of God and they are the hyacinths and anemones along the stream of Reality. Like unto the unshakable mountains and victorious, unfunded Banners they are firm and steadfast in the Cause of God.

O thou Ameen! Thou beholdest that I have neither time nor any opportunity for writing. Thou must beg pardon on my behalf from the friends of God; for in this journey correspondence was impossible and I was excused from writing letters to anyone. God willing, after the arrival in the Holy Land this broken thread will be resumed and the past will be amended!

O thou Ameen! Praise be to God that thou were assisted to mention the good names of all the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful. All that thou hast said was right and in accord with facts. Truly I say, the believers of Persia are self-sacrificing in the path of God and each one of them is shining and scintillating like unto the luminous lamp. In the path of God they have accepted every hardship and gladly embraced every suffering, drinking the bitter cup with thanksgiving. Now they were thrown in the prison under the chains and anon were they threatened with death beneath the sharp sword. A number while dancing hastened toward the arena of martyrdom and unfurled their banners upon the Altar of Love. Their houses were pillaged, repined and devastated. These souls are fearless in the worlds of existence and these people are the sincere servants of the Blessed Perfection.

Now convey infinite longing on my behalf to all the friends of God and advise them that this is the time of spreading the Cause of God. They must consider how Abdul Baha, although bodily weak and infirm yet he is travelling over mountains and deserts. He does not rest one moment neither does he seek one second of tranquility by day and by night. In every gathering he raises his voice and in every meeting he cries out 'ya "Baha El Abha". The friends of God must show an effort, scattered themselves in all directions and be engaged by day and by night in the guidance of the people; so that this world may become the paradise of Abha and the light of the most great guidance be ignited in the most transparent lamp for the Orient is the dawning place of the Sun of Reality and the planting ground of the Blessed Tree! Upon thee be Baha El Abha.

Dear Harriet!

At last the Stuttgard trip is in sight! Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock we will leave by the North Station. So this is my last communication from Paris for this time. After a short stay in Stuttgard the Beloved will again return here. His present intention is to stay only a few days and then start for Syria. I am glad to have it so in order that the friends of other cities may enjoy the Presence of our Beloved. We have stayed almost seventy consecutive days in this city. I believe this is a great privilege for Paris and I hope its results will be correspondingly great. may the seeds sown in the hearts be watered by others so that they may grow into mighty tree, yielding delicious fruits at all times!

This morning our dear sister Miss Beatrice Irwin had a very wonderful interview. The Beloved praised highly her practice nature and hoped she will grow day by day in this noble art of human expression. He hoped she will compose such poems as to inspire the hearts with great ideals and that they may be read throughout all ages. He said that she has great capabilities and through the Bounties of the Kingdom of Abha they will become realized. She read the following symbolic poem which was much admired by the Beloved. It was called "The Mount".

## The Mount

>>O Mount! O blessed Mount afar,
Beyond the Ken of mortal eyes,
O Mount of Crystal!
Source of streams,
O Mount towards whom the moon doth turn,
From whom the gold-seed of the sun cast on span, O throne! whose base is wreathed with "milky ways",
Whose crevices are bright with the stars,
O Mount! Beneath whose dome the universe and man Are clasped like hands in supplication,
Stretching aye, towards thy faint, ineffable for dream,
Of light and leaping waters, and or music
That o'erflows oceans and continents and our small souls.
O Mount! Whose summit is the source of streams
That wind upon an endless course
Through worlds seen and unseen,
Worlds that like dewdrops gleam a fleeting space!
Mount! Crystal Mount past Ken of mortal eyes!
Oh let the trembling span of these bright atoms
Be dissolved into the glory of Thy streams.
The streams that spring from that for source.
That source past mortal Ken.<<

{{p3}}

The Master gave her a stove of the greatest name and the Persian name "Mehreban". Besides he wrote a very inspiring prayer in her autograph book as follows: O Thou God, the Mehreban!
Suffer Thy Mehreban to become the Cries of Heaven! Confer upon her spirituality and fragrance! Confirm her in eloquence and explanation so that she may become the cause of the guidance of the souls and become the manifestor of Thy Favor! Abdul Baha Abha!

{{p4}}

Before the arrival of Miss Irwin an English friend called on the Beloved. She said that the Master's prayers and supplications in her behalf were all answered and she was now very happy and out of misfortunes and troubles. On her return to England she desired to have a weekly meeting in her apartment. The Beloved praised her efforts in the service of the Cause. He told her that whosoever with a contrite heart prays and begs from Baha-Ullah help and assistance he will be aided, even if he is sincere and whole-hearted in his prayers.

{{p5}}

At 10 o'clock, the friends of Mirza Dowond arrived Mon and Madame Moser. They have a wonderful palace in Switzerland in which they have collected a rare collection of Persian arms, ancient and modern. This museum is famous all over Europe. The man has published a very rare look with photographs of these arms. The book is in all the large libraries of European Capitals and his name is well-known everywhere. He has been much imbosted in the cause for the lost few years and has done much service in Stuttgard. The Master's talk with him and his wife covered a vast range of subjects and he is going to translate and publish it in a special pamphlet, so I do not need to repeat the same here. It will cover many pages and is most interesting and instructive. The Master in reality was going to have for Stuttgard today and he stayed especially to meet these important people. They went away very happy with the life giving words of the Beloved. Other people had interviews and all were sorry because the Beloved was going away.

{{p6}}

About noon he called me and together we went to Miss Sanderson to say goodbye to her mother and herself. He was most eloquent in his praise of their services to him and to the Cause, catolling the beautiful qualities of Miss Sanderson. He was so wonderful in his praise for her that anybody should be proud just to know her. The Master has often praised her attributes, her sincerity in the Cause, her beautiful spirit, her calmness, her sweetness of nature, her services but never have I heard him so wonderfully eloquent. He declared by Baha-Ullah, again he declared by Baha-Ullah that she was his real daughter that in his estimation, there was no difference between her and Rouha. Both were his real daughters. Does anyone in this world expects to hear a greater commendation from the Sacred lips of the Center of the Covenant?

Rouha Khanom is feeling much better and I think after tomorrow she will come out of the Maison de Saute and will be again with Miss Sanderson this time to recuperate. The Master was going to rent an apartment for her but neither Mrs. Sanderson nor Miss Sanderson would think of such a thing and at last he yielded them. Coming back, he sat at the table with the rest of the friends and ate his lunch most heartily. After his rest some letters were read to him from America and answers were revealed immediately.

{{p7}}

at three o'clock two of the important princes of Persia called on him and they were most lovingly received in his own room. One of them said that he had rented an apartment in the same building that the Master was living on his first trip. The concierge finding that he was a Persian showed toward him extraordinary honor and asked him whether he belonged to the same nation that "Le maitre Abdul Baha" came. If so he was ready to serve him at all time. The concierge told to this prince that when the Beloved left the apartment last year one of the American friends went there and bought the special chain over which the Master often sat for seven hundred dollars. The Beloved spoke about America and its natural scenery, especially the mountains of Colorado looking up to the sky. Then because one of them had read in the American papers the account of the Beloved's address in the Jewish Synagogue, they asked about it and the Master spoke at length on this subject.

At five o'clock he told us to call an automobile and with Doctor Mahmoud Khan and Food Effendi he went to call for the last time on Rouha Khanom till after his return from Stuttgard.

He returned at 7 o'clock and Ahmad Pasha was waiting. For about half an hour he spoke with him and then he come up to his room.

{{p8}}

He called Mirza Mahmoud and myself to his presence and spoke about the wonderful confirmation which will descend upon all those who arise with the deepest sincerity to teach the Cause of God.

Monsieur Dreyfus had sent us the railway tickets and in order to avoid any difficulty each one got his. The members of the part are Sayad Ahmad Bageroff, Mirza Mahmoud, Sayad Assadullah and your humble servant. My next communication from Stuttgard! Hurrah!

###HOTEL MARQUARDT H. & O. Marqurot STUTTGART April 1st, 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet! 

Praise be to God that after many days of expectation on the part of German Believes they are at last favored with the Presence of the Beloved. We arrived at 8pm and immediately took quarters in this hotel near the station. 'With joy and happiness we have arrived at Stuttgart. Abdul Baha's message was flushed to all parts of the Orient Paris, London, Newyork Washington, Chicago, San_Francisco etc.

Today we were p unusually early. Although I had arranged all my affairs - by affairs I mean my one satchel yet the joy of visiting the friends {{p2}} of another country made the heart pulsate quicker. France had more than its shore; now the Sun of the Covenant must dawn from another horizon and cast its rays upon other people. As our sojourn in Stuttgart will be short we are not going to take with us much baggage our trunks in the same hotel. Mirza Jalal will stay in Martha Pension. Mr. Fraser and Miss Hadjson came to see the Master. He told them we are leaving for Stuttgart. While there, we will be engaged in spreading the Cause of God. We are looking forward to raise the Call of the Kingdom {{p3}} in that city and to cry at the top of our voice. The friends must also travel around. If possible, as many of them as they can, they shored more from place to place; days here, 15 days there. Where we they go, they must cry the message of their Kingdom like unto him.

He will be with them always. Wherever they are his heart will be with them. Let them know this of a certainty. The Bahais spread around, and promote the glad_tiding of the Kingdom of Abba. Let them open their wings, and fly in the atmosphere of heavenly Teachings. Do they not sit silent. This is the day of speech. They must work' they must strive. 

{{p4}}

When he leaves Paris they Miss Fraser and Miss Hadjson and also leave for London and while there spent their time in calling the people to the Kingdom. Wherever they go they must teach the cause and speak about the Kingdom. Let them not spend their time in alter discussions. Let them dedicate then lives to the Cause. It is his hope that they may became heavenly, divine, spiritual, attracted, enkindled!

Mou and Madame Dreyfus and many Persians come to say goodbye and it was about 15 minutes after eight when we left the Hotel for the Gore de L'est. The Master went with Mou. Dreyfus in his auto and we got two taxis for ourselves and other friends.

{{p5}}

Arriving at the station I hurried ahead and got the seats for the Master. He and Ahmad Bageroff had first class tickets and the rest I'd class but we were all on the same train. At the station there were many Bahais with bouquets of flowers for the Master and the little girls with her mother to whom I have referred in other places. The Master loves this girl very much and she is also attached to him when he saw her he exclaimed the joy: Oh! my friend has come also to bid farewell. I am very glad! 

{{p6}}

Now he is in his comportment. His arms are full of flowers. He looks out of the window. His face is benign and smiling. His moving hands shower divine blessings upon the friends and then he utters his last words: I shall never forget you. You will be always in my memory. I leave you here as my own Souvenirs. May God assist and confirm you! My last advice to you is: Arise and the teaching of the souls! The train moves and slowly adds to its speed. We look out of the window, we see t e weeping faces of the beloved, then hands are in the air, hats and handkerchiefs are waving and then only one turn, and they are shut off from our view and we find ourselves looking at the meadows, blooming trees, green valleys, cultivated fields, vast stretches of forests, happy, contented forming communities, busy industrial cities, rushing rivers large towers, and beautiful hills covered with blossoming trees all abloom! These latter affect from a distance as snow Copped mountains. Every now and then the Master gleefully exclaim. How divine! How beautiful nature is! It is clothed in its color! I am glad to travel at this time of the year. How all creation is transformed {{p9}} with the touch of the spring! He asked me to read to him the news. I told him of the death of Mr. Porpons Marzon. Regretfully he said that it would have been well, had he breathed one breath in the Cause of Baha-ollah! He has left all that wealth which he accumulated during his life time and which now will serve him to us purposed! When I told him that the stock Exchange in My stopped five minutes to pay homage to this financial genius Mosgan he was accused. "Only five minutes!" he exclaimed.

Sayad Assadullah had prepared a five bunch for us, rice, chicken, matzo on etc.  

{{p9}}

The Master said that as soon as he started travelling he felt much better. This is very significant indeed and showed the place of God that he must not stay in one place, too long!

An interesting phase of the Stuttgart trips was the total ignorance of the German friends about the Beloved's departed from Paris. He told Mom Dreyfus not to telegraph them at all because he was going to "surprise" them. While the train was speeding along, laughing and boyishly he was telling us that this was the best thing: We will arrive in Stuttgart, take our rooms in a hotel, settle down {{p10}} and then call up the friends! How will they be surprised! Was not this a five plan? We were going to surprise them! When they come to the hotel they will find us in their midst; but now they know nothing about it at all years this is the very best plan! About 3 o'clock tea was served and then he read a few letters from America, revealing answer to each, He was very happy as he dictated Tablet after Tablet while looking out of the window into the lovely country adorned with blossoming trees! White pink and red. At 8 o'clock we reached the station and the Master alighting from the train walked upright {{p11}} to hotel Marquardt. Rooms were engaged and then I telephoned to Mr. Herrigel and Mr. Ekstein and a letter was despatched by special messenger to Miss Kuablock. When over the phone I told Mr to Mrs. Werrigil that Abdul Baha was in Stuutgart. I could feel by the intonation of her voice that sleet almost pumped up with the air with delight and surprise! "What! What! Abdul Baha here! in Stuttgart! Is this possible!" Within a few minutes Mr. Herrijel arrived and was taken into the Mt. Master's room. The Beloved embraced and kissed him very affectionately and said: you see! I have come! I have fulfilled my promise! God willing you will also come to Haiji. On Mount Carmel there are many of your conformist--- God hath chosen him from amongst the German for the sake of his oven Love. His Holiness Christ hath said : many are called but few are chosen! At this time Mr. Eksteir was announced. He has been to Paris last year and had seen the Master, so they Know each other and he received a warm welcome. Then the Beloved continued: Consider the Beauty and Favor of Baha-ollah! How he has wanted us together in Faith and assurance. He hath cemented together our hearts, our {{p13}} spirits and our souls. Our love is stranger and more powerful than the love which exists between the members of one family. This is real union for whenever I thought of you I was made very happy. Outwardly a few years ago we had never heard the name of Stuttgart and you had never heard the name of "Now!" Such is the rectifying power of the Word of God! It is not yet known what hers created in the hearts but when this grows and observes and yields delightful fruits then its importance will be fully understood; {{p14}} then the world of morality will become illumined, spiritual susceptibilities will be obtained, the minds and the souls will be educated, the lights of sanctification will shine forth the people will became real since Bahais; the lights of reality will be reflected through the transparent glass and the solidarity of humanity will become apparent and manifest. He spoke in detail which is impossible to now. Arrangements were made that tomorrow he devoted {{p15}} to the formation of the Cause. Siffer was said to be brought to the Master and he spoke while he was eating. We went into a restaurant near bye and after 45 minutes we returned to the hotel. Miss Alma Knoblock and Miss Doring were waiting. We talked with them a few minutes about the Master and the joy and sacrifice of the believers when they hear that he was actually amongst them! Miss Doring is a good and faithful Bahai and she serves the Cause very faithfully. 

The Master had by this {{p16}} time retired so they could see him but tomorrow morning!

I feel very  happy in Stuttgart. The friend here are very warm, very genuine, very sincere, very earnest. The Cause has taken a firm hold of the truth seeking German people and it will grow and grow.

The Master's room is on the second floor no. 150 overlooking the broad avenue; the Royal Pork and the palace are not for.

All Germany must sing the songs of joy because the Beloved of the World is in her midst! Germany has news had a more honored and a more divine Guest than Abdul Baha the Mystery of God. Happy Germany.



### HOTEL MARQUARTDT H. & O. Marquarot STUTTGART April 2, 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

This was a day similar to the busy days of the Master in America, through the air of Stuttgart we inhaled a scent of spiritual activity, even in the early morning. Of course everybody was up before six and Sayad Assadullah was preparing the Beloved's tea over his small alcohol stove. I was in the Master's room waiting his commands. Letters and telegrams arriving from Budapest urging him to go there, but no definite decision yet. The Beloved dictated telegraphic messages to various parts. He walked from one to the other and of his unusually large room.

{{p2}} 

For breakfast he ordered a glass of milk. At half-past light the believers started to come. Everyone carried a bouquet of flowers. Mr. Herrigal, Doctor Fisher, Mr. Ekstein or Miss Knoblock translate translation of my English into German. A number of the friends, however speak English. Love and sincerity are the two supreme characteristics that I have observed in these people streaming in from 8:30 am to 1 pm. Many of them were weeping with joy and kissing the hands of the Beloved or the hew of his garments. What heart-trilling scenes were witnessed all morning! He also unveiled the face of his love in a manner not witnessed and affection before to all those who had the privilege {{p3}} of visiting him this morning. Afterwards he said; He inhaled the fragrance of humanity in this city. One cannot properly know the depth of his sweet and heavenly love for his own children. In order to let you have a peep at the room no 150 and what was being said and I will quote a few of his works. Some are asked about his health and expressed the heavenly joy of having Abdul Baha in our midst although they were not worthy of it. He said that he was enjoying eternal spiritual health. It was a health, never followed by any sickness! There was no doubt that the Germans were very worthy because God has sent him here so that he may summon the people to {{p4}} the Kingdom of Abha. This was a blessed day because he was associating with the German Bahais. This was the cause of his joy. The greatest happiness for man was to behold the faces of the friends of God. How sweet it was to converse with the believing Praise be to God that this is made possible. He hoped that great insults will be the outcome of these meetings; the rays of the Sun of Reality may shine forth and the Kingdom of God be established. Just at this moment the East and the west were gathered together in this room, exercising toward each other the utmost of kindness. This was through the power of the Love of God <5> otherwise it would have been impossible.

To another group of visitors he said: This was a good city. It was very delightfully situated. It was a worthy place to become the Vineyard of the Kingdom and like unto trees which are covered with foliage blast our and fruits, the human temples also may be revealed in adorned with heavenly Virtues. He hoped that each one of them may become a heavenly gardener so that there may saw pure seeds in the prepared soils and the variegated flowers may grow they grow!

The visitors hoped that this well {{p6}} be accomplished through the assistant of Baha-ullah and Abdul Baha. Another group of Bahais entered and the Beloved welcoming them said: As soon as he heard that a number of souls have embraced this Cause in Stuttgart he became infinitely happy. He told the friends at that time that the circle of this Effulgence will widen and widen in this city and because the ground was fertile the people were recipient, therefore the seeds of the Love of God shall grow into mighty trees.

Three friends came in with flowers in their hands and the tears of joy in their eyes. He said that these flowers were the harpings of spring! He was very happy {{p7}} because he came to Stuttgart while nature was welcoming the spring. Although this is the beginning of the material spring, may the beauty of the divine spring petals its tent in Stuttgart.

To another delegation he said: He had cause to pay them a visit. He hoped they will pay back his visit while he returned to Haifa. He had travelled more than 20.00 miles to reach here, but they will not have to cover so much distance! This was a mother than proof of his intense longing to visit them!

Miss Alma Knoblock came and the Master arose from his seat and greeted her most warmly Oh! Miss Knoblock {{p8}} Oh! Miss Knoblock! She was very welcome! very welcome! He loved her very much! His heart was attached to her. In reality she was the behold of the Kingdom. Her heart was pure and attracted otherwise she could not serve the cause so well. Her society confirmed her in the services of the cause. While in America he always remembered her. He now forgot her. He was greatly attached to their severe friends who are selfless. Let her thank God than she attained to such a bounty! God willing her heart will become more illumined day unto day. He will ever pray for her and {{p9}} all the German believes so that the confirmations of God may descended upon them. Let her teach always the Cause of God. If she taught soul in a city and he was being attracted after one year he would make tour. And so it went on and on and on. I can write many many pages but there is no time. Doctor Fisher brought two actors to meet the Master in Laloniki and one of them spoke Turkish. The Beloved talked with them on the evils of war which are perpetrated in the name of religion. They were very much impressed. One of them asked about theatre {{p10}} and its influence upon the public. The Master said. The plays should endeavor elevate the ideals of humanity and not degrade them. The theatre is life unto a school and the playing here must ever think how to educate his audience through the characterizations of noble ideals and personalities. The actors must embody in their uttered words and deeds, which in their roles, the noblest emotion of the highest motives, the most delicate art, the tenderness feelings and the most attractive appearance. The chief aim of the theatres should become the spiritualization of humanity.

{{p11}}

Throughout all the interviews that the Master gave this morning. I could feel a new vibration in his power and an added majesty to his station. Many of the friends came with their children and he embraced them, Kissed them, made them sit on his hope or stand on both side of his chain, caressing them and gently touching with His Blessed hands their faces and hairs.

"He had his lunch in his room and we had ours into a good Restaurant. At 3 o'clock Mr. Herrigel arrived with an automobile to take the Master for a ride. We drove through the hills and valleys allowed their spring garments {{p12}} for one hour we drove and we reached the Royal Park. Here the Master alighted and walked through the Park. He entered from one gate and the automobile was going to pick him at the other gate. He walked through the spacious avenue, picnickers wonderingly looking at him, not knowing who was this glorious man. He sat in the middle of his walk on a bench and Mr. Herrigel cut a sign on it so that the friend may come and visit the peace afterward. He called the gardener who was working nearly and gave him a few Marks. The man was surprised and astonished and started {{p13}} to thank profusely. Mr. Herrigel immediately took out of his pocket German Bahai booklets and gave them to him. "This Man he told him" is the friend of all the poor and laboring classes. He is your friend too." The gardener was touched very much. Returning house Mr. Herrigel was all the time pointing to us the interesting buildings, both public and private, the police of the King, the new museum, the new hospital, the new large royal theatre etc. We arrive at his residence at about five o'clock. At first the Master rested in the bed room for half an hour, which the friends gathered{{p14}} for the meetings. Four large rooms thrown to one another were filled with the friends their faces full of joyful expectation. It is impossible to describe the contagious happiness of the German believers. They are brimful with optimism came into the crowded rooms they all arose and many eyes were weeping copiously. Mr. Heirigel said: we the German believers shall now forget this day! It will be remembered throughout all our lives. It is the day of great rejoicing for all Germany. May we be all worthy of this heavenly Bestowal! We welcome Abdul Baha {{p15}} in our midst with a heart over flowing with joy. Then the Beloved with the light of great happiness in his eyes said: Praise be to God that he had come to Stuttgart and he was associating with the friends in this blessed house! Praise be to God that their faces were illumined with the rays of the Love of God, and then hearts attracted to the Kingdom of Abha. Let them thank God because they had heard the call of God and were living in the world in the Glorious Day of the Lord of Hosts; they were witnessing the wonderful down of the Sun of Reality, whose rays home cost their {{p16}} splendors and reflections upon the mirrors of their hearts; then souls were illumines; their spirits assured, and their consciousness stirred with the glad-tidings of God. Therefore let them strive that they may become radiant through the lights of Baha-u-llah. There may be rose from his seats, took away the child he had in his lap while he was speaking and then walked around, shaking hands with the friends, everyone, even the little girls and boys reverently kissing. May each one of them become like a light candle. Perchance through their efforts these darkness may {{p17}} be dispelled (now he was in the other room gently passing by their one or that, like a fragrant breeze) and the lights of the love of God may enlighten the East and the West. This hatred and enmity may be changed into joy and fragrance; these foul clouds may disappear. Now be kissed a child who offered him a banquet of flowers and joy and fragrance be obtained, this world may become another world; Eternal life may be made possible and the Breathes of the Holy Spirits may surround all.

Then with an ample of flowers, roses, carnations, {{p18}} violets, tulips he walked into the private room, leaving behind and only the fragrance of these material flowers but a perfume of the spiritual flowers of the Rose-gardener that will ever enrich the lines of those who were friend of Abha! Many of the believers who had arrived late and did not hear his talk were taken into his room and while relieving on bed he spoke to them. There were professors, Sculflo, Artists, musicians, etc, each one asking questions and receiving answers to satisfy his minors bead.

An automobile was brought at the door and with two Baha young men and Mr. Herrigel, we lead <19> to another half an hour ride. While the automobile was speeding along he said: you must thank God that at this hour you are sitting in this car with the Center of the Covenant. The importance of this event cannot be fully appreciated at this time. It will became known in the future. Looking over the bills were covered with blossoming trees, he said : A man not acquainted with botany could not know what kind of fruits there trees will yield at the time of fruition but a skillful gardener does know. Therefore in this day those souls who have {{p20}} spiritual perceptions are capable to appreciate the importance of this event.

Arriving at the hotel the Master rested for awhile, and then the large and magnificent car of Counsul Sehwartz who called on the Beloved this morning with his wife and daughter come to take him to the second meeting in Mr. Henrigelis name Cousul Sehwartz has offered his car to the Master to use it at his discrete. First we had a ride through the bills overlooking the city. It was the most beautiful sight that I have ever seen! It looked like heaven upon earth. Thousands and two thousands {{p21}} electric lights illumined the encircling hills, the valley and the distant horizons. The Master looking at the wonderful panorama of scintillating lights and dazzling illumination said: How really beautiful would it have been if the people were as light as these lights. Baha-ollah always loved to have many lights in the evening. In the darkness of the world he has ignited many thousand lights he has studded the heaven of his Cause with many stars! May they ever shine and gleam!

We reached at Mr. Herigel's home. Although it was raining, a large group of {{p2}} friend had waited outside for half an hour to be the first ones to greet him. The Beloved looking into their blooming face said: "How attracted and enkindled are the German Bahais. How much full of love they are! Love does not need a teacher.

Walking ahead of this large group. I was surprised to see so many people. I am sure there were more than 200 and yet half of the friends are not notified about the Beloved's arrival.

What a glowing, enthusiastic beaming faces! The Master then entered the house and all arose. He lead them to be seated and called one of the little children {{p23}} to his side and then continued to speak: This was a very blessed night for he was meeting souls who were believers in God; souls who have turned their faces toward the Kingdom of Abha; souls in whose face one witnessed the rays of the Sun of reality; souls who were of the chosen ones and not of those who are called. He gave a brilliant addressed on the prophecies of the coming of the Promised One. His last word was: Tonight he felt very happy to find himself in their midst!

There were so many people {{p24}} that some in the other rooms were standing on their choice in order to get a glimpse of the Master as he walked to and from. Amongst those who were present was Miss Pallock who had travelled from Gotha, a distance of 10 hours to see the Master. She is the sister of Miss Assayah Allen of Wash. D.C.

One of our Bahais in Stuttgart is a book binder. With the hope that the Master will visit this city he had prepared a most precious book with the finest paper and cover so that the history of the Cause in Germany may be written in it. His hope was that when the Master come <25> to he may write on the first page and then Mr. Herrigel compose the history.

At ten P.M. dinner served at Mr. and Mrs. Herrigel and the Master spoke about the prophecies of Baha-ollah which were fulfilled today as well as the Germans who have built a large colony on Mount Carmel. These Germans were honest, sincere seekers of truth and according to their calculation. Christ was going to descend from heaven on Mount Carmel, so they migrated to Holy land and laid the foundation of the present colony. It was very {{p26}} significant that in the very year that they reached Mount Carmel Baha-ollah also arrived-thus fulfilling the prophecies.

After dinner the Beloved shook hands with all those who were present at the table and in the Cousul Sehwarz he was driven back to the Hotel.

Thus the first day in Germany came to an end with the greatest of happiness. The Beloved was most delighted to see so many children of the Kingdom, all united with one thought and accord serving the cause and letting the light of revelation Shine forth.

Love to all

Ahmad



### April 3rd 1913

Dear Harriet!

Wherever the Beloved goes he carries with him the spirit of life. His presence creates spiritual atmosphere; his words confer assurance; his teachings elevate the thought; his voice draws one near unto God; his love teaches us to love mankind; and his tenderness makes us affectionate to all humanity. In him we find all-life and all-light combined. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the ending. Whether in Germany or in France, America or England, Egypt or Syria he is the King of Kings. The German people love and honor him with the same sincerity and loyalty as do three of other nation. His throne is in the Palace of universal brotherhood and all the tribes and races of the earth are welcome to his audience-chamber. The most civilized man of the West whose mind is a treasure-house of Knowledge and wisdom and the simplest man from the steppes of Russia or the illiterate Arab from the Sahara of Africa find the Beloved on Elder Brother and one in whom the spirit of God dwells. His heavenly spirit has broken the barriers language and nationality. All the people are humble before him because he considers himself the humblest. Day by day I marvel at his wonderful power of attraction. His unifying spirit is the most stupendous fact of the present century. How scarcely any rotation unity between the Germans and Persians? Abdul Baha is able to make the two forget their customs and show toward each a love and fellowship which are the standing miracles of this age. There are certain  inner experiences that we have to go through before we can get the adequate insight into the marvelous powers of the Master.

{{p2}}

This morning the sun shone forth gloriously upon Stuttgart to welcome the God-like guest who looks out of the window watching the crowds of Germans going to their work. The Germans generally speaking are strong in physique, vigorous in their mental activity, industrial in their practical lives, earnest in their pursuits, devoted to love and substantial in  every way. They are a noble race. Their love for this Cause is in describable, their respect for the Master is unimaginable, their firmness in the Covenant is unquestioned. In three days we have grown to love them as our own Kith and Kin. I could never dream that the Cause had taken such a firm hold of the German mind and heart. Really it is nothing short of a miracle!

{{p3}}

Before nine o'clock the friends started to come. I may say there were many "meetings" instead of interviews from 9 to 10 o'clock. Every few minutes the room was filled, the Beloved delivered an address and then emptied and other delegations arrived. Among the first arrivals were Knoblock, Miss Kostlin, Miss Doring and many others. The Master spoke about the last night meeting: He was very happy last night. He saw that in their midst the fire of the love of God was enkindled. Last night one beheld in that meeting the breaths of the Holy Spirit and the Confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha! The influence of that meeting will be felt throughout all Germany because the effulgence of the Sun of Reality was cast upon it. It was a very radiant meeting, the hearts were turned toward the Kingdom of Abha, the eyes were looking forward the Supreme horizon, the spirits were rejoiced with the glad-tidings of God. In that meeting there was baptism with the spirit and fire. He hoped it may yield great results and the lights of love may radiate from that meeting to all the regions of the world.

{{p4}}

To another group: Today God has conferred upon them a new Confirmation and a new power. He testified that their hearts was pure, there they had no other aim except the good-pleasure of the Lord. They were the servants of the overtness of the world of humanity. They were kind to all the religions. They loved all the people. Their longing was for the realization of public weal. Their lofty intentions on their part shall lead them to the highest destination. As he was surrounded by several lovely German children, one of them lying her head on his breast, he spoke on education and how they must teach the children English- so that they may be able to correspond with American Bahais and may travel to each other's countries.

{{p5}}

One asked whether Christ ever traveled to India to study Indian philosophy. He laughed: No! Christ did not go to India. He did not need the Indian philosophy. Then he spoke at length about the Covenant. Through the power of the Covenant they can withstand the attack of all those who are on the earth. The victorious army of the Covenant was waiting on the field of the Supreme Concourse to assist all those who were firm and steadfast and crown them with the diadem of triumph.

{{p6}}

Others come in and the voice of the Master was raised again in praise of last night meeting. It was a divine gathering! All of those who were present enjoyed it. It was a Bahai meeting. There were the susceptibilities of the Kingdom. There one witnessed the Love of God. He hoped that many such meeting will be organized here in the future. To a lady he said: Our year of real Bahai life is equal to a thousand years. If a man lived 1000 years he may not attain to eternal life but if he lived one day according to the precepts of Baha-Ullah he shall obtain Everlasting Existence. One of your days is better than a thousand years of others. For the doors of the Kingdom are opened before your faces; the light of reality is shining upon you; the eyes of your perception are unstopped. You are informed with the realities of all phenomena; you are acquainted with the mysteries of the Kingdom of God.

{{p7}}

The room was again filled with newcomers and he said: As he believers of Stuttgart arrive and deport this morning each one of them was to him like a fragrant, fresh, imperishable bouquet of roses ; each one was like unto a brilliant lamp and a shining star. In their faces he beheld the effulgence's of the Love of His Holiness Baha-Ullah. Happy were they! Happy were they to obtain to such a Bestowal. This is the day of the Lord. The birds of bygone ages who were caught by the go and wind of autumn longed for this delightful spring. The flowers which were thirsty in those days were yearning for the dove power of this rain from the clouds of Providence. They were thirsty for the water of life and hungry foe the food which is now descending from heaven. Praise be to God that they have attained there unto. Two talks were given an marriage and the education of the children, each one containing may ripe opinions and directions.

{{p8}}

A painter who has made a pencil sketch from Abdul Baha's photograph taken in Paris brought him a few copies. The Master praised his mask and said: Can he paint upon the page of the world the ideal picture s of the Supreme Concourse? The pictures which are in the ideal world are eternal. He desired him to become such an Artist. Man can paint those ideal pictures upon the Tablet of existence with the brush of deeds. The holy divine manifestations are heavenly Artists. Upon the canvas of creation, with the brush of their deeds and actions, they have painted immortal pictures which could not be found in any art museum of Europe and America but he could find then divine Masterpieces of the Spiritual Artists in the galleries of the hearts.

{{p9}}

Miss Pollock come. Several others were present. The Master asked what news she had from her sister Mrs. Allen in Wash? "She lends her love to Abdul Baha and lock of Roushan's hair to me." "Did she send you also a fragrance from Golshan?" the Master answered. (This was a play on word. Golshan means "rose-garden" and is the name given by the Beloved to the second child of Mrs. Allen) The Master said that Mrs. Allen was serving the Cause; that she was very attracted and enkindled. Miss Pollock asked what could she say when people asked her; whom did you go to see? He said: Tell then I went to see Abdul Baha, the Spreader of the religion of Baha-Ullah, the Standard-bearer of universal Peace, the Crier to the Kingdom of God, the Servant of God and the servant of humanity.

{{p10}}

Many, many more groups arrived and the Beloved talked and talked. It was as though the sea of his utterancess was sent in motion. Within one hour Mr. Herrigel and Mr. Ekstein who were assisting me in translation left the hotel exhausted and at the same time delighted to see the results of the Cause.

{{p11}}

The Master had his lunch and he told us of a dream he had last night. He dreamed he was in Tiberius. Along the shore he was living alone in a small cottage which was built with mud bricks but he was most happy and surrounded with a spiritual atmosphere indescribable in its beauty and calmness. There was Esmael Aga with him. As Abdul Baha talked with him, he was silent. Then he told Esmael Aga that small humble cottage was more beautiful and exquisite that the palace of the King. And Esmael Aga answered in reality it is so, it is so.

{{p12}}

At 3 o'clock Consul Schwartz came to the hotel with his car and took the Master for a ride. He drove us through most beautiful country places and the valleys covered with the blossoming trees and the forests of pines and the prairies carpeted with wild violets and flowers. We inhaled their sweet adorn bringing to us the messages of spring. We drove as for as "Schloss Solitude" a wonderful palace built 200 years ago by one the Kings of Wurttemberg. The palace is now empty and open to the tourists. Napoleon lived in it for more than 2 weeks as he was in friendly relation with the then King of Wurtemburg. He was there before his Russian campaign and had in army nearly 30,000 of the men of this King; but only 800 returned. It was also this King who persecuted Schiller the great poet and he had to fly by night from Stuttgart. The Master walked through the whole palace was greatly interested in all the  historical events connected with it, especially the room in which Napoleon had slept. When he came out of the palace many children were gathered there from a nearly village and he gave to call one a work. Sayad Ahmad Bageroff wrote the day of the Master's visit to the palace on the wall, facing the Grand Staircase. The palace was built on a hill and overlooked a wonderful valley for miles and miles. The panorama was most unique.

{{p13}}

On our return the Master spoke about the future of Stuttgart, that it will progress extraordinarily because the Call of the Kingdom of Abha was first raised here! He was very loving to Consul Schwartz, He held his hands all the time, kissing him and calling him: "My son, my son I love you very much!" The car brought us to 3 Alexanderstrosse, the home of the Consul. AT the Threshold the Master kissed his both cheeks. His wife, his daughter and two sons were waiting at the door to greet the Master. They kissed his hands and with the greatest joy they took him to a room to rest before the meeting. The Minister of the Church of the King will be present at the meeting. After a few minutes the Beloved entered the large parlor. Prominent men and women of Stuttgart were present. Rusul Schwartz had his own special stenographer to take down the address. As Mirza Mahmoud was not here its Persian could not be preserved. The Master delivered a wonderful talk on the fundamental unity of religions, the oneness of the world of humanity and toward the end he made a dramatic appeal that this century is the century of brotherhood, this day is the day of love, this period is the period of convocation.

After the meeting, tea and refreshment were served and the Minister of the King who spoke English fluently had a private interview. The Master, then retired to the bedroom and from the window he watched the whole valley suddenly illumined by thousands of electric lights. It was a magical transformation of darkness into light.

{{p14}}

At eight o'clock we were taken to a hall where the first public meeting was to be held. As we entered the place, there was no room to move. Hundreds, probably five or six hundred Bahais and friends were gathered. With much difficulty a lane was made for the Master to ascend the platform. All arose from their seats. Mr. Herrigel introduced him. There the Master spoke, I translated his words into English and Mr. Ekstein translated my English into German. It was a very interesting scene! When Mr. Ekstein could not remember the exact word in German, dozens of vows were raised from different corners, giving him the English word; showing that there were quite a considerable number who could understand English. Here are the opening remarks of the Master: He has come to them from a very distant land. He has traveled back and forth more than 20,000 miles to reach to Germany. He has been in prison for 40 years. Young he entered the prison he came out as he stood before them. Not withstanding the vicissitudes of prison life and the weakness of the body he accepted the hardships and inconveniences of traveling, covering such long distances to come here and behold then illumined faces. His aim was that perchance the world of humanity may be illumined. Praise be to God that the Radiant Century hath come. Praise be God that the spiritual springtime hath pitched its tent. Praise be God this is the age of the discovery of the realities of things. Verily, verily he saw unto them. This age is the age of lights! This age is the age of sciences! This age is the of the appearance of Truth! This age is the age of the extension of the sphere of thought! This age is greatest divine age! This age is the age of Everlasting Life! This age is the age of the blossoming forth of all the hidden virtues of the world of humanity! Then his thoughts flew toward the spiritual realm and brilliant pearls of wisdom, he displayed on the benefits of divine civilization.

{{p15}}

Then he desired to offer a prayer at the Threshold of the Almighty in their behalf: O Thou Kind God! This congregation are the sheep of the flock and Thou art the real Shepherd! These souls are Thy children and Thou art the loving Father! O God! Encircle them with the glances of Thy Mercifulness! Open before their faces the doors of Thy Guidance! O God! Descend upon them Thy heavenly Confirmation make their eyes seeing and their ears hearing! Quicken their hearts are gladden their spirits. May all of us take a portion and a share from the Sea of Thy Providence! May each one of us be sheltered beneath the Tabernacle of Thy Protection! O God! We are poor, unlock before us the doors of the Treasures of Thy Kingdom! O God! We are humble endear us in Thy Realm! O God! Establish affiliation between the hearts and attract the spirits to each other so that all humanity may enter beneath the all inclusive Tent of the Oneness of the world of humanity! May wars and rumors of wars be entirely forgotten! May humankind attain to the highest summit of felicity! O God! Answer our prayers! Verily Thou art the Kind! The Giver! The generous! And the Bounteous!

{{p16}}

After the meeting there were so many people who wanted to shake hands with the Master that it was impossible to move around. Every lady rushed forward to kiss his hands yet in all their movements there was dignity and respect. As the Master came out they filed like a regiment of soldiers and he shook hands with almost everyone. Outside around the car they were again gathered together and as be entered it, there were hundreds of hands with hats and handkerchiefs waving loving farewell to the Beloved of their hearts!

{{p17}}

We were again driven back to the house of Consul Schwartz for driven. At the table there was a physician who was quite corpulent. The Master joked with him: He did not need to say that he was a physician. He looked it! If anyone doubled his efficiency in keeping the body whole, tell him, look at me! Several course were served and at half past eleven we were back again to the hotel. The Master prayed before loving Consul Schwartz is have that divine blessings may descend upon him and his family. They are really wonderful Bahais, sincere and devoted to the Cause.


### Hotel Marquardt, Stuttgart April 4, 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

The Bahai Cause is firmly established in Germany. No power on earth can ever uproot it. It has attracted unto itself some of the best elements of this country. In Stuttgart we have many Bahais who are very prominent even from a material or intellectual standpoint. What I admire about them- men, women, children alike- is their deep correctness and faithfulness in the Cause. They appreciate the value of the Teachings and unitedly have they arisen to promote them. They have done and are doing a great deal of translation and although the Cause is very young here, yet they have already a good Library on Bahai literature. The master is most pleased and very happy over the conditions of the Cause here and has often remarked that the movement will be promulgated far and wide.

{{p2}}

As this morning a group of the friends gathered around him, while closing his eyes as though looking into the future, he said: At this time it was not known what a bounty has been destined for Stuttgart. It will become evident in the future. When the rain pours, the sun shines and the zephrys blow, the bounty hidden in each is not known, but when the prairies become verdant and trees green, then everyone will see the result! When the divine speedower comes along and scatters the seed, nothing is visible except the black soil, but when the harvest is gathered, the success will be evident. Similarly the grace of God which has surrounded Stuttgart cannot be seen now, but ere long every eye shall witness the results! Last night he prayed for the people, the city and the government of Stuttgart. He begged of God divine Blessing. In reality Wurttemberg was an excellent country, its people were very progressive and its government fair, therefore he asked heavenly Confirmation for them so that the Favor and Grace of God and the Supreme Bestowals of the Merciful may encircle them.

{{p3}}

When years ago the Germans arrived from Stuttgart to Haifa to lay the foundation of their colony, their leader Hoffman Herteck become Abdul Baha's friend. He called on Abdul Baha. At that time Abdul Baha was a prisoner but Herteck showed him much love. From that time on Abdul Baha become great admirer of the Germans. The Germans in Haifa did not associate with any one except with the Bahais. There was a German carriage-driver who worked between Haifa and Acca. Somehow he was attracted to the Cause and whenever he came to Acca he would call on Abdul Baha. But as Abdul Baha was a prisoner the guards would not let the German speak with him fearing the latter may communicate to the former some dangerous to the state. So the Germans stood far away and looked at Abdul Baha and he would look at him then smile and smile. Thus, each time they communicated with one another. By this, Abdul Baha meant that the Bahais friendship with Stuttgart people was very old. Now in order to strengthen this tie of friendship he has come to pay the Germans a visit. In reality we are the members of one family, because the Love of Baha-Ullah has cemented together over hearts. He has already sent many cab grows to all parts of the Orient and America that he was now in Stuttgart. This news will give them great rejoicing and happiness. Then he spoke about the devotion and the self-sacrifice of the Persian believers.

{{p4}}

A regards the last night public meeting he said: It was a spiritual meeting, a heavenly gathering. The lights of the Kingdom were shining upon it; the Confirmations of the Holy-Spirit descended upon it. Consider what a wonderful Bounty and Favor this was that a personage from the East and the German from the West were gathered together. The result of these meetings will be known later.

{{p5}}

To another group of friends gathered about him he said: We are all close relations. We are the members of one family and one household. We receive the lights of one sun, drink from the same fountain, walk in the same rose-garden, and are under the protection of one gardener, therefore we enjoy amongst ourselves the utmost of amity and unity. He hoped that day unto day this communication may increase. This age is the age of lights! This century is the century of love! This period is the period of the oneness of the world of humanity! This cycle is the cycle of the down pouring of the Bestowals of God!

{{p6}}

There was amongst those who were present a very all man with a very long beard and a very young heart. The Master talked with him a great deal, kissed his beard and they become great friend. It is most interesting to observe the love and the respect that the German children have for the Master; even the children who are four or six years old came into his Presence with such a reverence that is impossible to describe! They all bring flowers and fruits. The Beloved gathers them around himself, near the window and showers upon them his blessings. To see him sitting on the chair near the window every morning and surrounded often with six or ten children is the most ideal picture I have seen! Now and then he gets up from his seat, takes a child by his two arms, lifts him up and puts him on the bed to the delight of the mothers and those who are present.

{{p7}}

Same one said, if we have worked in the Cause a hundred years we could not attract so many different elements to the Cause, only Abdul Baha can do that. He answered: He hoped that each one of them may become a divine former and each one may cultivate a large blessed form. The real Bahai forming is through deeds. May they become become adorned and confirmed with such deeds and  actions that they may become the pure seeds. The Bahais must be known by their deeds. That is why His Holiness the Christ says: Ye shall know the trees by their fruits. God hath chosen the Bahais from amongst the people and has opened the doors of His Kingdom before their faces. Therefore they must appreciate the value of this gift so that each one of them may become a lamp lighted with the Fire of the Love of God; day unto day may they be driven nearer unto God in order that their hearts be inspired with divine Inspirations. May they become as fruitful trees producing luscious fruits for all the seasons. He has desired this station for them. The majority of the people are the lovers of shells, praise be to God the Bahais are lovers of the kernel. The people are deprived of reality but the friends have reached the home of Truth!

{{p8}}

A mother with three of her daughters who were all good Bahais were presented to the Beloved. After welcoming them he said: He was very happy to have came to Stuttgart and he supplicated at the Threshold of the Almighty to descend upon them His eternal blessings. They were his friends, his real friends and he shall never forget them. He shall continually remember them. They were his own daughters. He hoped that in the orchard of God they may become fruitful trees. Let them be happy because they have entered under the protection of Baha-Ullah. They were all the sheep of God and the Blessed Perfection was then shepherd. Let them be confident in the Favors and Bounties of Baha-Ullah. His everlasting Bestowals shall surround them and shall choose them for a great service from amongst his own maid servants. Their mention will become eternal in the Kingdom and their names still be handed down to prosperity and in the divine world they will like ignited lamps and they will be related hi God.

{{p9}}

In short, I may go on writing many more pages about the Beloved talks on the morning but these few drops are sufficient. A one o'clock we found him almost exhausted from the four hours consecutive talk. He said he was most happy to see the believers of Germany so holy, so pure and so united. They were the angels of Paradise of Abha! You pray that the Flame of this divine Fire may be ignited in all Germany. He had his lunch and took his rest.

{{p10}}

At half-past two we had tea in his presence and at four o'clock Consul Schwartz with his wife and daughter came with their car to take the Master to Esshinger where Miss Anna Kostlin, a most devoted enthusiastic Bahai has prepared a children's party to greet Abdul Baha. Another onto was hired for the other Persian friends and after a few minutes we were driving through the most beautiful part of the country, all abhors in a riot of colors and hues! We passed by rivers and falls, mountains and hills, all clothed in the joyful garments of spring. How I wished the American friends could share these hours in the divine presence of the Master! This is the most beautiful season and I am glad that we did not come last month. On our way to Esshingen we saw many vineyard, mountains from bottom to summit are changed into vineyards.

{{p11}}

Consul Schwartz asked about the future events in Europe. He answered: There will be a general war between the European powers and Germany of course will take a prominent part. Baha-Ullah has predicted a war between Germany and France and this will be fulfilled! Consul Schwartz is the Representative of the Norwegian government and is the president and proprietor of a banking institution which was founded by his father. As we sped along the road the Master enjoying the wonderful changing scenes of nature. The Consul told him about himself and his visions of life and the Master assured him that everything will be well with him. We were driven through the famous Blackwoods of Stuttgart and were simply charmed with the heavenly panorama constantly opening before us. It was as though we were driving through a fairy land.

{{p12}}

At last we arrived at Esshigen a giant lovely tower. Here there are a large number of young men who have become Bahais. Miss Kostlin, the hostess who always smiles and laughs and is charming young lady was dressed in beautiful white silk. She was radiant with happiness and bubbling over with joy. She and a large number of mothers were waiting at the door of the Royal King. As our beloved ascended the stairs, they followed him reverently. Now we were in a spacious room, just before entering the Hall. What is this entrancing scene before our eyes? More than one hundred children boys and girls most of them dressed in spotless white, each one a bouquet of flowers in his or her hand, waving in the air as a welcome to the Kingdom and suddenly the Chorus of "Allah Abha" was raised from all! I was overtaken with surprise emotion, joy and could not contain myself! Tears filled my eyes! It was the most beautiful, the most heavenly, the most artistic picture that I have ever seen in all my life. Then the Beloved walked in their midst, touching the head of this, looking into the radiant face of that and meanwhile talking the words of light. He had brought with him candies in small decorated boxes and he divided amongst them. Then he entered into the large Hall. Here there were many tables big and small decorated with flowers and candies and fruits. All the children and their mothers sat at the table. A long table at the upper side of the hall was prepared for the Master, the platform was decorated with large palms and orange trees. Oh! It was so beautiful! I cannot describe these things. One must feel them, see them! It was a glorious day indeed for these people in a far away tavern of Germany to see with their own eyes the Desire of all nations! What love! What attraction! What enkindlement these German believers have! As to Miss Kostlin, she was serving and looking after the happiness of the friends. I have seen few girls who are as happy and as radiant as this really remarkable girl!

The Master and his friend sat at the table and later he delivered an address which i translated into English and Mr. Ekstein translated my English into German. When the Beloved finished speaking, tea and refreshments were served and afterward all the children and the mothers and fathers were called to go out to a photograph with the Master. When the Master come out in front of the Hall everybody in the large gathering had a flowers in his or her hand. It was a lovely idea! The Master sat in a chair and I begged him to have a red rose in his hand! Two pictures were taken and I am sure they will turn out to be very good. After this the Master had farewell to everyone and walked toward his car. Everybody gathered around the car and offered him their flowers; others holding their flowers in their hands waved them in the air.

While the picture was being taken more than 500 men and women and children as curiosity seekers had gathered in front of the Hall because they had never experience such an event in all their lives.

{{p13}}

Before the car started on its way the Master called Miss Kostlin and thanked her and her associates for the splendid arrangements of the Feast. She was overwhelmed with joy with this marked distinction.

{{p14}}

We left Esshingen with a heart full of happiness; borders of our hearts inundated with a flood of emotions. On our return they took us through another road and again we beheld the constant shifting scenes of the beautiful country and vineyards. Arriving at the hotel the master invited Consul, his wife and daughter to come up. As the daughter is studying art, the Master asked what was the best for her children to take up. The Master said: The parent must let the children study that which they like best. If your daughter loves art she can devote her time to it and surely she will succeed. Painting was a lovely art and most refined. We have a Bahai artist in New York. Her name is Miss Juliet Thompson. At first, she requested me if I give her one or two sittings she would found my picture. I consented but the one or two sittings become many. I wondered whether after all she got all the sittings she wanted (here the Master laughed). Then the daughter of Consul asked, whether she would be permitted to paint him. "All right" the resigned answer came out with a twinkling of smile in his eyes. "How many hours do you require?" "About three hours." "This is too much; would fifteen minutes do?" "Oh no! It is not enough." "Would half an hour do?" At last it was arranged for Monday that Frauline may paint him. "I hope you will not walk in Miss Thompson's foot steps." He told her laughing.

The Beloved rested the evening. Mr. and Mrs. Herrigel called and he served them tea prepared with his own hand.

Our trip to Budapest at last decided. we will leave for that city on Tuesday evening by way of Munich and Vienna.



### Hotel Marquardt, Stuttgart April 5, 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

It was the fifth of December 1912 that we sailed away from New York and this is the fifth of April 1913 that I write to you from Stuttgart, so it's four months that the Master has been traveling in Europe, spreading the message of the Kingdom and promoting the principles of the Bahai Cause. Now we have before us another trip to Budapest and on our return we will probably make a short stay in Vienna. This German sojourn although only a few days old yet so far much work has been accomplished and innumerable souls are attracted to the Cause and will no doubt be more drawn to it as soon as the Master leaves the city. It is interesting to note that from the time the Beloved arrived in Stuttgart to the time he is going to leave will be exactly 8 days and before arriving he expected to stay only one day or two, but he found the German believers so warm so enkindled that he decided otherwise. Owing to certain reasons known only to himself he requested the friends to avoid newspaper publicity, although the city knows him and speaks about then Cause. As he goes out and enters the hotel the eyes are turned toward him and wonder at his majesty.

{{p2}}

This morning he prepared the tea with his own hand and served us most lovingly. A little incident which shows more than anything else his extreme courtesy and thoughtfulness was this: He had just given me the cup of tea and I was going to drink it, when he remembered, Sayad Assadullah had no tea; so he told me, he was going to call him to come in. I put my cup on the table and wanted to go in his place. "No, no" he said. "You drink your tea. It will get cold. I will go and tell him to come." Just think of it! How thoughtful and considerable he is even to his nearest servants who are ready to sacrifice their lives for him. 

{{p3}}

After a while he revealed several Tablets for the American believers especially one for the Bowery Mission which were immediately translated and forwarded. In the book which is intended for the historical records of the Cause he wrote: "O God! Confer Thou a shelter upon this person under Thy Protection and surround him with Thy Infinite Bounties! Verily Thou art the Generous and the Merciful.

{{p4}}

In the family book of Consul Schwartz he write: "O Thou Incomparable Lord! Bless Thou the members of this Household and endear these souls in Thy Kingdom and confirm them in the service of Thy Cause! Verily Thou art the Powerful! The Mighty"

{{p5}}

"Young Hefner" with his mother and father came to see the Master. I do not think the boy is more than 4 years old but very intelligent and a true Bahai. He has been coming every day and receiving much love from the Master. They told the Master he had already taught all the children of his quarter about the Bahai Cause and was full of love for Abdul Baha. This morning his parents asked him "Where should we go?" "Of course he directly answered "We will go and pay our homage to Abdul Baha. Is there any other place to go while he is here?" "What will you take for him?" "A basket of apples and flowers." " All right."

And so he entered the room, a basket of red apples in his hand, decorated with pink carnations; with curly hair, smiling face and the words of Allaho Abha on his lips running toward Abdul Baha.

{{p6}}

When the Beloved heard how "Young Hefner" was teaching the Cancer, he embraced and kissed him and said: It is most excellent to be a teacher in the Cause from childhood. When he was at the age of this little boy he was also teaching. While he was still living in Persia there was a believer whose brother was not a Bahai and he was very anxious to make him one. He was brought to Abdul Baha and he spoke to him about the Cause. At last he said: "I am not convinced. I am not yet satisfied." Abdul Baha told him that if a person was not hungry he would not long for food; if he was not thirsty he would not yearn for water; only a seeing eye could be convinced of the existence of the sun; only a hearing ear could hear sweet melodies. Therefore first of all he must find the seeing eye, he must become hungry and thirsty; but he could go now and when he got these attributes he could come back. He went away and after sometimes he returned. Abdul Baha spoke with him again and this time he become a good Bahai. There were many children today and the Master took them one by one and made them sit in front of him on the bed. He gave to each candy and fruit and they sat quiet all the time.

{{p7}}

His first address to a group of people was about the four periodical seasons of each religious movements. Now, he said it is the spiritual springtime of the world and the spirit of God is soaring over the sea of existence.

{{p8}}

He picked out from another group a man and addressed him this: I love thee very much, I desire thy illumination with the light of God. May thou discover the secrets of realities! Mayst thou obtain seeing eyes so that thou mayst behold the Kingdom of God! Mayst thou receive hearing ears in order to hear the heavenly Call! Mayst thou be baptized with the Fire of the Love of God, with the Breaths of the Holy Spirit and with the water of Life!

{{p9}}

To another group he spoke in detail about the two kinds of Happiness; material and spiritual. Man through spiritual happiness alone finds peace and contentment. All other material means are a temporary satisfaction.

{{p10}}

To another group he spoke on the importance of spreading the message: Today if you teach one person it is as though you have resurrected a dead soul into life. It is as though you have changed the black stone into diamond. It is as though you have transmuted metal into gold, Satan into angel, animal into man.

{{p11}}

About noon, Mr. Ekstein was in the room alone with the Master. He said, for many years he has been the President of different societies and has tried to serve each according to his ability but now he has realized that all these denominations did not contain the whole truth and in the Bahai revelation he has found the complete truth. Yes, the Master answered: A thirsty man will run after every fountain, he may drink bitter and stagnant water but at last he will reach to the sweet spring. Now praise be to God that he has attained. All these roads are narrow and will end either to precipices or wild jungles but the highway of truth is clear and all the smaller roads converge into it. The Bahai Cause is the sweet spring of water which is never dried up. It is the great highway which leads man to the glorious palace of the King of Kings. It is the limitless sea and all the lakes and rivers are limited. In other word, all the religions and societies find their principles not only unfolded in this Dispensation but well-developed.

{{p12}}

The Editor of a monthly German magazine which is published in Switzerland came to see the Beloved and saying that he desired to write a monthly article on the Bahai revelation. The Master approved his plan and he will start next month.

{{p13}}

Many other friends were presented to the Beloved, some receiving Persian names for their children, others asking for the stone of the greatest name.

{{p14}}

At 3 o'clock the Beloved with Doctor Fisher. Mrs. and Miss Schwartz and myself motored to one of the loveliest palaces built according to the plan of Elhambra in Spain. There were many halls, reception rooms, sleeping rooms, and hot houses! For two hours the Master walked through the buildings, the furniture oriental, and the paintings oriental. There were several graded buildings and cupolas and picture galleries in most beautiful and ideal place. It is called the "Royal Palace of Wilhelm". It was built by one of the Kings of Wurttemberg 90 years ago. He loved Arabian architecture so much that he commissioned the architects to draw the plan of Elhambra for his palace. He spent at that time about 10 million marks in building it and it is a dream of beauty as you walk around, it is as though you were reading the Arabian night story. The Master said: On one hand this wonderful palace shows the high civilization of the Saracens in Spain and on the other hand it makes one sad to contemplate that all these marvelous traces of geniuses of Arabian civilization are entirely forgotten by the people of the Orient and instead of advancing they have been retrograding. Returning to the hotel the Master thanked most heartily from Consul for giving us such a good time in the afternoon. He evidently enjoyed the outing very much. They were invited to drink tea with him. Both mother and daughter as well as the Consul are very rare Bahais and most sincere.

{{p15}}

At eight o'clock the Consul with Mr. Herrigel came to take the Master to an Esperanto meeting. Arriving at the meeting the President of Esperanto Society in Stuttgart took the chair and delivered quite a long and interesting address in German. Afterward the Master spoke in detail on the usefulness of a universal language quite from another standpoint than the two former ones in Edinburgh and Paris. Mr. Ekstein translated my English and the audience listened most carefully. Miss Pollock was in the automobile with the Master.

{{p16}}

After the meeting we were taken to Mr. and Mrs. Ekstein for supper. Miss Pollock was also invited. A large table was decorated with lovely flowers and many delicious eatables; the two sons of Mr. Ekstein had come from another part of Germany to be present. Mr. Ekstein showed the photograph of his father to the Master. "My father was clergy man", he said. Back came the divine answer. "Thy father was the minister of a church of clay; mayst thou became a minister of the Kingdom of God." Miss Pollock said: "I am teaching English in Gotha. Thou hast been a teacher of the earthly language, now is the time to become the teacher of the heavenly language. Spread the message wherever thou art. Teach your pupils both languages." "I will do my best. In order to make them study English I will teach them the Bahai literature." "All right! This is very good." the Beloved said. "For seven years my sister tried to make me a Bahai; now I am one. I know Abdul Baha as the manifestation of Reality." "The Bahais never give up till they succeed."

{{p17}}

Mr. and Mrs. Ekstein of course were most happy to have the Beloved of the world in their home and at the head of their table. After the dinner the Master looking at Mr. Ekstein Consul Schwartz and Mr. Herrigel said: "You are a wonderful triumvirate; three fine spiritual champions. I am going to let you wrestle unto each other to see which one is the victor." After talking with them for a few minutes the Beloved was taken to the hotel. It was very late and we retired after a full and busy day.



### HOTEL MARQUARDT STUTTGART April 6 1913

{{p1}} 

Dear Harriet!

The Master had today the most beautiful sight of Germany passing before his glorious vision. We motored through the "cherry-blossom country", a few miles outside of Stuttgart. Such a scene of white and pink blossoms I had never seen in my life. The consul at three o'clock brought his machine and we motored first to Esslingen, the scene of the children's party, then through a portion of the Black Woods and then suddenly we came upon the "cherry-blossom country". For miles up the mountains and down the valleys, thousands of tree were adorned with the white garments of spring. If the meadows were not green and the weather was not balmy and thousands of men {{p2}} women and children were not out to have a view of this indescribable scene of beauty, one would have just all these trees were covered with snow and that we were in the grip of winter. From very far places people drive to this village at this season to enjoy this wonder of creation! The Master was simply enraptured with the loveliness and attraction of this panorama of nature. First we drove uphill, then down, enjoying the view from every point. It was also a balmy and delightful day and the crowds holiday were either walking in the meadows or stretched under the trees. It was one of the rare experiences that one can never forget. For me these days are the days of Paradise, filled with {{p3}} happiness never ending!

Thus being Sunday, before nine o'clock the believers started to come. There were so many that crowds were standing outside ready for the room to be emptied so that they may be able to come in. The Beloved was the incarnation of love and affection. There were many children and to these he was specially attentive. He gathered them around himself near the window and showered his love upon all without any distinction. The mothers were made very happy. For them this has been their supreme joy.

While he kissed and caressed the children he spoke: What did the Esperantials say last night? {{p4}} I delivered an address to them according to their conception of truth. They were the beginners therefore I spoke to them with gentleness. The Bahais must speak always with the people from their own standpoint. If you explain the difficult problems of mathematics or geometry for the children they will not understand, it is above and beyond their comprehension. That is why his holiness Christ says: I have many things to say unto you but you cannot comprehend them now howbeit when the spirit of truth shall come he will lead you unto all the truth. Therefore the friends must always consider {{p5}} the mental capacity of an audience and speak to them from their standpoint so that they may not be shocked and run away and that by degrees they may attain to the reality. Can we give strong food to a suckling babe? If we do such a thing the life of the babe will be in danger. Its constitution cannot assimilate roast chicken - or beef-steak but only pure milk. Now you have reached to the age of maturity. You can comprehend the secrets of the Kingdom, but the majority of the people are yet as children, they must be fed with the milk {{p6}} of gentleness. Therefore deal with them ever gently so that they attain to the age of maturity; for this reason his holiness Christ said to his disciples: To you it is given to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom and again he said, do not east the pearls before the swine; because the apostles were the people of reality and others were the followers of superficiality.

Then he spoke how the Jews expected the descent of Christ from heaven, while in reality there was no heaven. Praise be to God that your eyes are opened and you are witnessing the mysteries of God; your ears are unstopped and you are listening to the divine Cale. Consequently with these people whose eyes and ears are shut {{p7}} you must be gentle and patient. These children shall reach to the age of maturity; these tender plants shall attain to the stage of fruition, these sleepy ones shall become awakened from the slumber of negligence. But then at that time their station will not be as great as now! Now is the accepted time. Those souls who became awakened during the life time of Christ, they were the chosen ones, they were the stars of the heavens of Truth, they were the lamps of guidance. How can we ever compare the station of the apostles and those who came later! Therefore your station cannot be compared with those who will be awakened {{p8}} later. You are the first fruits of the season and very much sought after but afterward the newest will become surfeited with fruits. You are the first budding flowers in the rose garden of Knowledge. I am most pleased with the believers of Stuttgart. Truly I do; they are illumined, even their children are radiant.

Looking at an old man with long flowing beard he said: This old man is a real lion, nay rather he is greater than the lion, because the lion has only the brute force while he has the spiritual power.

Speaking to Mr. Ekstein he said: Last night we dined in your home and we were very happy there! {{p9}} Mr. Ekstein said that his home was now dedicated to the Cause. The Master said that his home has been always dedicated.

Then a young couple who are engaged come to see the Master. Their names are Miss Bertha Babmiller and Mr. Boppe. The Beloved received them with great love and cordiality. They looked as sweet as one can expect very demure and very loving. Abdul Baha told them that they were most welcome! He was very pleased with them. He prayed that the benediction of God may descend upon them, the Breathes of the Holy Spirit may surround them and may they be submerged in the sea of the Mercy of God. If the heavenly blessing does not descend, no matter how much man may strive it will be fruitless. If the rays of the Sun {{p10}} do not radiate, the trees will not yield fruits. If you find a lamp lighted, it will be the result of the training of the Sun. The rays of the Sun of Reality are the Divine Confirmations and in turn these confirmations are like unto the showers of the spring. If we see the torrential rivers flowing, they are the result of the aggregation of the rain. Without the Confirmation of God nothing is possible of attainment. He hoped that the divine Confirmations may descend upon them. May they find the highest state of happiness! May they live together in the utmost state of joy and beatitude! May they advance day unto day in all the degrees of ideal perfections! {{p11}} May their thoughts gain a wider range of reflow. May their ideas develop. May their information wisest! May they become like unto ignited lamps and the lights of divine Bestowals may appear from them so that in this world they may live together in the utmost state of felicity and obtain eternal life in the Divine Kingdom, that they may become beloved in both worlds. This was his prayer in their behalves. God-willing they will be in the greatest state of joy.

There was a girl who desired to enter into the Monastery as a nun. The Beloved said: There is no such thing in the Bahai Cause but one may engage in the spread of the cause {{p12}} and dedicate as much of her time as possible and spend her days in the service of the Kingdom and whenever apparently come up, she may marry. There was perfect freedom in this Movement.

Many more people entered the Master's room and the Master continued to speak to this and to that group till well nigh one o'clock. When at last everybody left, as he was walking back and forth, he said: The believers of Germany are very warm, very sincere, very attracted. They shall be confirmed to teach throughout Europe.

Just then large number of the believers from Esslingen come and the Beloved ever kind and compassionate received them. He said: They were welcome. They must thank God that meeting like unto this is being held; for this meeting cannot be compared {{p13}} with other meetings. This meeting is for bringing together those souls which are illumined. This meeting is through the power of the Glad-tidings of God. This meeting is for the people of the Kingdom. This meeting is like unto the magnet and the iron. This meeting is like unto the meeting of the rain and the earth. This meeting is like unto the meeting of the fire and the oil. This meeting is like unto the meeting of the breeze and the trees. Therefore it contains many important results. Now its fruits are not seen. When the rain is falling, the wise man will see the transformation of the earth into verdant meadows and flowers. At present it is not known what forces are set to work, ere long it will become {{p14}} apparent. The results of this meeting are the change of the hearts into sweet and verdant flower-gardens; the out flux of the fire of the Love of God, the discovery of the mysteries of the Kingdom; the enfoldment of the knowledge of God; the attainment to eternal life; entrance into the mount of transfiguration; the effulgence of rays of the Sun of Reality; the acquirement of the excellences of the worlds of humanity and the realization of everlasting felicity. He hoped that through this system of Bahai education may become the light reflecting lamps of the assemblage of mankind.

To Mr. Herryel he laughingly remarked that the German Bahais were coming here as {{p15}} such numbers that the proprietor may leave the premises and run away for his life, saying I leave the hotel in the hand of Mr. Herryel and his friends! No doubt everybody was wondering, what was the business of all these people coming here every morning.

After our delightful excursion through the cherry blossom country, we resided the house of the Mother of the wife of the Consul. There all the friends had gathered to take photograph with the Master in the large pack of Wangerlungsh 5. There were so many that we had to divide into seven groups; one for men {{p16}} alone. Then Consul Schmidz took some small photos of the Master under a cherry blossom tree which I hope will turn out to be good.

After drinking tea and thanking everyone, especially the mother of Mrs. Schmidz and the mother of the Consul, the Beloved drove to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Friedrick Schweizer in Karlstrasse 25 Zuffenhousen. They are excellent Bahais. Mrs. Schweizer was simply beside herself with joy. She is filled with the Love of the Master. Consul Schmidz said later that he was a German yet he often wondered at the rapt enthusiasm of these two souls. {{p17}} The Beloved drink a cup of tea and made a few remarks as follow: Here he came to their home! May God encircle it forever with the lights of Truth. May it be blessed always. We have come here in the name of Baha-wllah. Any house in which the name of Baha-wllah is raised, the blessing of God will descend upon it; the divine light will shine upon it, and the Breathes of the holy-spirit will waft over it. Therefore he prayed to God that special blessing may descend upon their home. May it become a heavenly home, may the mention of Baha-wllah be made always in that home.

We drove back to the hotel {{p18}} and after a little rest, at half-past eight we were again on our way to Oberes Museum. This was a public meeting arranged by a committee of Bahai women in the largest hall of the Museum. It was a big, beautiful building. The Master on entering was greeted by the rise of the audience. The big hall was filled to the door. More than 800 hundred people were present and the Beloved gave a stirring and eloquent address on peace and Love. Mr. Ekstein translated again my English and whenever he could not think of the right word, voices were heard again from the front seats and all parts of the Hall, coming to his assistance. After the lecture the Master walked around the audience and shook hand with everyone. {{p19}} This was the largest meeting ever held in Germany in the Bahai Cause and no doubt its results will be immense in the future.

After this meeting the Beloved was driven to Miss Alma Knablock and Miss Doring's apartment for supper at Newe Weinsteizer 23. The apartment is on the fourth floor and after such a strenuous day it was a little difficult to walk up to the fourth floor but in order to make them happy the Beloved did it with pleasure. After a few moments rest, supper was served and the Consul told the Master about the constitutional loves of the country and many legends {{p20}} and stories enacted with different castles.

The story of the Faithful woman appealed the Master. There was a castle which was besieged by an enemy and his army. After some months, at the point of starvation the castle capitaliates. The general of the victorious army issued a proclamation that all the women may leave the castle with their most precious possessions. Within half an hour, the women piled out, each holding the hand of her husband or sweetheart or brother. At first, the victor objected to such a proceeding, but when the humanity, sympathy and the humorous situation of it struck him, he laughed heartily and let them go fire. After the supper we returned to the hotel. It was rather very late and he went directly on our rooms to sleep.



### April 7th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Here we are in the most beautiful part of Germany! Mergentheim baths! I have never heard its name before and it is only through the heavenly blessing of the Beloved that we are enjoying such a wonderful time! It was about 10:15 this morning when in two of the finest automobiles of Consul Schwarz we left Marquardt Hotel for Mergentheim Baths, a distance of 130 miles from Stuttgart. This was arranged by the insistent invitation of Consul Schwarz who is not only the President of the Mergentheim baths but has the controlling share {{p2}} in the company. In the first car the Beloved, Consul, his wife and daughter, Doctor Fisher and myself and in the second, Mirza Mahmoud, Sayad Assadowllah and Sayad Ahmad Bageroff. We gave up our rooms in the hotel because we are returning tomorrow and leave at 7:54 pm for Budapest. We started from the hotel while it was pouring but after half an hour driving, the air was cleared. Till half-past twelve we drove over rolling green hills, mountains and valleys. The most ideal spots on the face of the earth.

We passed by many villages and towns and here and there I saw women, harrowing the earth, sowing the seeds, driving cattle, cutting the grass; in brief doing all the works that the men generally do in America. {{p3}} It was very interesting to see this because it seemed to be such a common thing here. The daughter of the Consul told me, yes women in this part of Germany do most of the farming and the men are tailors, shopkeepers, etc. I thought, I would like to know whether these women hear anything about the rising of the New Woman, the lofty position that she fills in the modern social world and the demand for suffrage which is carried on like a holy war in England and with dignity and diplomacy in {{p4}} America. Because these German farmerettes seemed so resigned to or rather satisfied with their lots. At half past twelve we arrived at the Hall, a quaint old town and the hotel Lamm and Past stopped for an hour and half to rest and have our lunch. At two o'clock we started again and it was 4 o'clock that we arrived at the most luxurious hotel of Mergentheim.

On the way the Master spoke to Consul about Bismark and how he was enabled to bring the confederation of German principalities through the idea of the unity of language and unity of race. {{p5}} Consul Schwarz was astonished to hear such a clear and loud account from the lips of the Master. The country was again most charming, the scenery very attractive and our eyes were delighted with such green garments of nature. The Beloved looked all the time at the verdant meadows, and was very pleased. He said that God has sent him to Germany during the spring so that he may love every part of it.

Soon the town of Mergentheim become visible on the horizon and after a few minutes we passed through {{p6}} it and reached the hotel which is built on the slope of a hill, overlooking a vast panorama of other hills and valleys, a most attractive situation. The buildings of the Mineral baths are in front. Our rooms having been assigned, the Master drunk a cup of tea and retired. After awhile we walked around the ground, climbed the hills and the Consul took some photos of the Master. He visited the baths and blessed the place. Abdul Baha said that this place was under the protection of God. It will become a very important center. He prayed to Baha-wllah to assist and confirm Consul Schwarz. A Bahai woman from Stuttgart had an interview with the Master. She had came especially here to see the him, showing no matter where the Master goes he was followed by those who desire advice and assistance. He told her to be happy and joyful! Trust in God! He is a faithful friend! He shall never leave her.

The evening the Master heard the history of the development of the baths and how from 1905 to 1911 the list of foreign guests had increased from 700 to 3000 during the season. The baths is for internal maladies, kidney, gall stone, constipation, etc. The mineral water is also bottled up and sold for this purpose. There are electric baths, massage, etc.

At nine o'clock we had our supper and when the Consul related a funny story, and that opened the way for the Master to come back with 6 or 8 funny, side-splitting stories, one after another. The party divided about 10:45, the Master also retiring first to take a bath and then sleep. It was arranged to leave Mergentheim the next day before noon so that we may reach the city in time for Budapest train.

This morning before leaving Stuttgart the Master had a call from a prominent German clergyman who had read the book of some answered questions in French and become greatly interested in the Cause. The Beloved spoke with him on the materialism of the present country and how dogmas and imitations of religions have divided the people. He said that he hoped that the clergyman would become confirmed to awaken those soul, who are sleep {{p9}} and illumine with the light of spirituality the German Empire! Two little gems of heavenly thought were left behind by the Master in Stuttgart that are translated here for the benefit of all. The first was in the book of Mr. and Mrs. Friedrick Schweizer of Fuffenhousen, a town near Stuttgart. They are simply lovers of this Cause. They are like two shining lamps, two brilliant stars. Their faces show the love they have in their hearts for the Master. They are most joyful. They radiate happiness. {{p10}} Here is the prayer written by the Beloved in their book: "O God! Endear this maid - servant of Thine in Thy Kingdom. Verily her heart is filled with Love and Happiness. Bless her family and encircle her husband with the Glances of Thy Providence."

In the book of Miss Anna Kosttleir he wrote: O Thou Kind Lord! Accept this pure and holy girl in Thy new Kingdom. Make her beloved by all and glorify her in their sight. Intoxicate her with the overflowing cup of Thy Love. Confer upon her tumultuous joy and irresistible attraction. Grant her an eloquent tongue and suffer her to become an embodiment of wisdom and divine understanding so that she may arise to diffuse the sweet Fragrances of the Paradise of Abha!



### HOTEL MARQUARDT H. & O. Marquardt STUTTGART April 8th 1913 on train toward Budapest

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

With hearts full of love, with memories encircled by the devoted services of the German friends, with minds illumined by the light of hospitality they have shown toward us we have departed from Stuttgart tonight at 8 o'clock while more than one hundred Bahais were gathered at the station to say Godspeed to Our Beloved. What wonderful Bahais these people have made of themselves! It seems they are the possessors of all the divine attributes. It was a compliment when the Master said: The German Bahais are angels. During our 8 days' sojourn in Stuttgart, we observed every mark of love from the Bahais and respect from the outsiders.

{{p2}}

This morning I awaken in Mergentheim at 4:30 and looking out of my window I felt the great calmness of nature which steals over one in such quiet and faraway places; then I prayed for all the believers in America, that they may become confirmed in the good-pleasure of our Master. I wrote a few letters and went out to see the Beloved, his room being in another wing of the building. As I entered, he was also looking out of the window listening to the sweet melodies of the nightingale which are found in these enchanting woods and forests. They sing very charmingly and as the Persians and lovers of this bird, the Master remarked, they would give anything in the world to come here and enjoy this earthly paradise. He thanked Baha-wllah, he said, that he has established such a great bond of love and communication {{p3}} between the people of the East and the West, otherwise what relation exists between Consul Schwarz and us! It is the power of Baha-wllah that has made possible this! You must appreciate the value of this Bounty so that day unto day it may become greater and more widely spread. Last night and yesterday he was thinking all the time over certain news that he had received.

The weather in Mergentheim was cool and vitalizing and this morning's air was bracing. Consul Schwarz took us around to show his mineral water factory. The water is bottled and dispatched all over Germany for internal maladies. The physician of the place was introduced to the Master. He told him: He must feel very happy because everyone comes here to seek health and he was channel to whom they received health. He was a dispenser {{p4}} of health! He prayed to God that he may be always successful in his mission and that this place prosper and develop!

After breakfast the special book in which noted guests write their names was brought to the Master. It was opened in 1911 by the Emperor of Germany and his royal train who stayed here for a few days. The following short prayer was written in it by a different kind of an Emperor. O Almighty! Abdul Baha arrived in this hotel and observes the utmost of consideration on the part of everyone. For one night he rested here. O God! make this hotel blessed and successful. All maids and servants were called and the Master gave money to each one. After taking a photograph in front of {{p5}} the hotel, we started our drive of 130 miles back to Stuttgart.

This time we took a more picturesque road and we saw yet, more charming, more beautiful, grand scenes of nature! Suddenly we observed that the other car which was following us disappeared. We slowed down but no use. In order to wait for them to catch up, we stopped at the village of Weinsburg in a little hotel called "Casthofz Tranble v. Fr Woforth". The Master rested in room No.10, drunk a cup of milk, visited for a few minutes at the home of Theobald Kerner, a writer of great fame in these parts but dead for the last 20 years. His home is a little museum containing his personal belongings. The Master walked through the room and was interested in everything.

Seeing our Persian friends not caught up with us, we telephoned to two village through which we passed to learn whether they had any accident. No! They had seen car passing by. Of course we concluded that they must have returned to the city by the same road we came to Mergentheim. Starting again we passed by Beilingen where an enormous factory for generating electrical power is being installed by Consul Schwarz and a number of Capitalists. The factory will distribute electricity to 105 town and villages and will cost 7 million pounds when finished. The Master came down and blessed the ground. Hundreds of men were busy installing machinery and digging the foundation etc. It was 1:30 pm when we reached at the house of the Consul and found the Persians already there 2 hours and half ahead of us. The Master was very tired and after a little rest, lunch was served. Bageroff and myself went out to send away a few telegram to Budapest.

According to telegrams received from Budapest there have been articles in Hungarian papers about the Beloved's arrival. Mr. L. Stark is the man, a Hungarian by birth who was arranging the program. In one telegram he says: "Everything ready. Lecture rooms, translators, reception, newspapers, over one thousand invitations issued." In another telegram he says: "Thursday evening theosophical {{p8}} society; friday evening public meetings of different societies. Preparing everything, all the friends are very happy." In another telegram he says: " Newspapers announcing arrival and lecture". Mr. Stark is a good Bahai and full of enthusiasm. It is mainly due to his tireless effort and work that the Master is going to Hungary. This again will show how one sincere man can draw the Master with the power of his love. I told the Beloved, it seems to me the sudden appearance of this man was the most wonderful thing, almost a miracle! Where this man Stark came from? He said: God had sent him. He was an angel in disguise. Wait a few years after my trip to America and Europe many great personage {{p9}} shall arise to serve the Cause.

At 4:30 the Master come out of his room and met several of the friends who had come to see him. We told them that he was most pleased with the believers of Stuttgart. They were attracted and sincere. After his departure they must all arise to serve the Bahai Cause with great firmness and let nothing on earth them. To Mr. Ekstein who wanted to go next year to Dresden, near Saxony to teach he said: This will be very good. He will ever expect to receive good news from him. Miss Anna Kosthin brought the photos of the children's party in Esslingen. They were very fine. {{p10}} The other photos were also brought in and they all have turned out to be very good. The Master was most pleased unto them. Everything in Stuttgart, he said was excellent and now even their photos are very good indeed. Miss Knoblock and Miss Kosthin had a long interview. They asked several questions which were answered to their satisfaction.

At 7 o'clock we were all ready to leave and the Consul took us in his car and in a few minutes we arrived at the station; the train leaving at 7:54. Group after group, the friends arrived carrying a {{p11}} bouquet of flowers and before all the people unembarrassed they went kissing the Master's hand. By half past seven more than one hundred had gathered the railroad officials and the passengers wondering of the strange spectacle! The train being ready, the Beloved with the rest of us started to get on the platform. The largest bouquet of flowers was brought by one of the friends.

Miss Knoblock, Miss Kosthin and Mrs. Schwizer and a Bahai young man requested the Master to accompany us for a few stations! It was a most moving scene of departure! Many were weeping, kissing fervently the {{p12}} hem of his garment! When the train pulled out all the hands, handkerchiefs and hats were up in the air waving farewell, farewell till we meet again! The Master's compartment was a rose-garden. The farewell scene of the Stuttgart friends, I shall never forget, because it was so genuine, so heartfelt, so spontaneous, such a great reality, showing how them people of the North were set aglow with the Fire of the Love of God!

I think one of the most original ideas ever conceived was that of Esslingen Bahais. Our train was going to pass through their station but would not stop there nevertheless all the friends are {{p13}} there just the same. Miss Kosthin was in the secret and knew all about it; she was their representative but she did not tell us anything about it till one station before Esslingen. Then she asked the Master to come near the window for a minute or two and as the train rushed forward by the platform, ever so many white handkerchiefs and flowers like buds were waving in the air! At that very moment, the Master realizing the situation waved back his blessing to them and Oh his radiant, surprised happy face! It was only for one second, but its memory will lasts with me all through my life! I did not see their faces but it seemed each one of them was an angel of light and love swinging through the air. One station after Esslingen our friends left us to return to their homes and relate the wonderful story of Abdul Baha. Surprise and love for now they could feel happy that they also surprise their Beloved on his departure, that way he surprised them on his arrival! It was about 9:30 and the train was going on rapidly when the Master called me to his compartment and for half an hour I spoke to him about the latest news of the Cause in America and the letters received. Being very tired, because the extraordinary auto trip of the last two days, he desired to sleep and I retired.

I slept too and at 2 am the Austrian custom officials awakened us to ask whether we had anything liable to duty. Having had my sleep I thought I would start to write this communication now. It is 4 am, {{p15}} Sayad Assadollah, Mirza Mahmoud and Mr. Heirigil who accompanies the Beloved are sleeping and I am writing. At 8:10 we will reach Vienna and after one hour will start for Budapest. I believe on our return the Master may stay a day or two in Vienna.



### Hotel Ritz Budapest April 9th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Now the horizon of Budapest is illumined with the world-illuminating rays of the Sun of the Center of the Covenant. For the next few days this city is the field upon which the spiritual forces of the Beloved will play and interplay. The ground is prepared, the people ready, the public informed and the Master as a Supreme General will direct his forces. Of all the places in the world Hungary is the land which needs these Teachings of fraternity. It is a land torn up by strife and contention. Religious prejudices hold high position and national hatred rankle in the breasts. The Master comes as a spiritual physician, carrying in his hand {{p2}} the balm of goodwill toward all men; as a divine peacemaker, holding aloft the olive-branch of Eternal Peace; as a unifier, showing to all mankind the benefits of corporation and reciprocity; as a heavenly musician, ravishing the hearts of men with his sublime strains and sweet melodies; as the sun of reality, radiating his rays upon all the people of the world; as a lover of the human kind, teaching the religion of love; as an ideal gardener, scattering the seeds of amity and affection in the pure ground of the hearts. In Budapest the spread of the Bahai Teachings will have a lasting effect, in creating better feeling amongst various antagonistic sects. Moreover the introduction of the Cause to Hungary has fallen in good hands. It will have an extraordinary progress.

{{p2}}

This morning we found ourselves in the train and in Austria. Just to think that the Master is on the Austrian land thrills me with joy! Will wonder never cease! The Austrian government has mobilized four hundred and fifty thousand men ready to invade Turkish dominion at a moments notice. Abdul Baha is invading the Austrian dominion without a moment's notice but as a Conqueror of Peace. He has love to enlist and enrol soldiers in his army but soldiers that give life! Under his universal flag all the nationalities are gathering, singing anthem of brotherhood and he has love his Austrian-Hungarian contingents. They will ere long defeat and put to rout {{p4}} the demons of war.

The country of Austria is very beautiful, the mountains and meadows are very green, the calm rivers are flowing, the houses and cottages are all white. There are many large buildings which we were told are no other than Convents. At ten minutes after eight we entered the Station of Vienna. Here the brother of Ahmad Bageroff with his wife and three children welcomed the Beloved with happy faces and bouquets of flowers. In order to leave for Budapest, we had to go to another station in the other side of the city. We got two taxis and in great hurry speeded along. I was pleased with the cleanliness of the streets of Vienna and the architectural beauty of its buildings. Having arrived at the {{p5}} other station, it was 8:50 when we pulled out but I made a mistake in not taking the train of 9:05; because the latter would have entered the station in which the friends were waiting to greet the Master while the one we took entered another. I did not know Budapest had two stations. In Hungary the country we passed through, was plain meadows and not mountainous, nor as cultivated as other parts of Europe we have seen so far. On the way Mr. Herrigel spoke about the Cause with many Hungarians {{p6}} and several were presented to the Master and he spoke to them on the Teachings.

The train entered the station at 1:40 pm and finding no one to greet the Master but knowing the name of the hotel in which rooms are engaged, we hired two carriages and drove through the principle streets of Budapest till we reached the Ritz Hotel which is one of the most elegant. It is built on the bank of Danoe, a fine broad river which empties itself into the black sea. On the other side of the river, on a high hill facing the hotel is the wonderful palace of Emperor Joseph of Austria-Hungary. The room of the Master was No. 47 on the second floor overlooking {{p7}} the palace, the noble river and the country all around. I can say that it is one of the most beautiful views we have ever seen. The room was full of light for the sun shone through the windows. The Master pronounced the view as most beautiful and when in the evening the electric lights were lighted, it was sublime! It was a calm night, the crescent moon was silvering the clear heaven and the stars were radiant, the little cargo steamers were passing before the eyes. For a long time the Master stopped before the window and watched the scene. Then he turned to us and said: It was a good night, {{p8}} only three months ago this hotel was opened and so everything was new and up to date. Hardly we have arrived at the hotel when word was sent up that Mr. and Mrs. L. Stark with friends have just returned from the other station and would be honoured to be received by the Master. Beside Mr. and Mrs. L. Stark there were Sirdar Unbrasingh Sher-gil of Majitha, a Hindu nobleman of Lahor, well educated, Dr. Kunos Igna'ez, President of Oriental Commercial University, Mr. Edward W. Moore, the manager of mining Machinery of America, Prof. Kovacsne, Balogh Wilma, Dr. Germanus Gyula, Alexander Simouyi, Editor of Pesti Hirlap and several other prominent men and women of Budapest. After a few moments the Master received them. Prof. {{p9}} Germanus greeted the Master in the names of different humanitarian societies; Mr. Stark gave me several Hungarian newspapers which contained notices of the Master's expected arrival and they were first translated into English and then into Persian.

Then the Beloved said: He was very grateful to their spiritual susceptibilities. For them he begged invisible confirmations. He had the greatest longing to meet them; but there were many difficulties in the way; praise be to God they are removed and now he found himself in their midst. Mr. Stark said that they were exceedingly {{p10}} grateful that the Beloved had accepted these hardships of travelling. There was no doubt that he was working for the public weal and for the progress of humanity. Therefore they thanked him for this self-sacrifice. This in itself was a great example to them so that they may know how to live and act. The Beloved said: He hoped that every one of them may become assisted in the service of the world of humanity. Today there is no greater Cause than the oneness of the world of humanity and Universal Peace. They must set the souls free from ancient religions, racial political and patriotic prejudices. As long as these prejudices lasted it would be impossible for the human world to find peace and security. {{p11}} Here in Hungary they must emphatically proclaim the oneness of human race, the oneness of native land and the oneness of kind; that they were all the fragrance of one Adam, the sheep of one Shepherd and the trees of one Orchard. God loved all his sheep. They were very dear and beloved in His estimation while the real Shepherd is kind, why should the sheep fight amongst themselves? The Sun of God shines upon all, the rain of his Mercy pours upon all, the Zephyr of his Favour wafts over all. He is the Universal Provider, the Great Educator, the heavenly {{p12}} teacher. While God is kind to us, why should we be unkind? God has created this humanity. It is his edifice. Is it just to destroy God's home? How short-sighted this. We are not only satisfied with political murder but we glorify in it, haunting that we have killed so many thousand people, that we have razed to the ground so many villages! It is similar to the criminal glory of a wolf, because he has killed so many lambs, because he has devoured 200 sheep. God has created us that we may be loving and compassionate toward each other and not like blood-thirsty animal suck the blood of our fellowmen. {{p13}} The Beloved continues to talk and those who were present were taking notes. It was again most interesting to see the words of life translated first into English and then my English into Hungarian by Mr. Stark. The Hungarian language sound strange but they tell me it is very poetic and flowery. It has however most unusually long words almost unpronounceable.

A photographer from one of the papers requested to take the picture of the Master in front of the hotel which he graciously consented. The first was taken with all the people around {{p14}} the Master, the second with only the Persians, the third alone. Coming back we had our dinner, inviting Mr. Moore with us. A Hungarian journalist came and the discussion took a wide range, the object and some of the Bahai principles. His interview will appear tomorrow morning in the journal called Pesti Hirlap. Later Mr. Stark, and his wife, Mr. Moore and others came and the Beloved talked with them on subjects which will take many more pages to write but my eyes are tired and I must retire to get a few hours sleep.



### Hotel Ritz Budapest April 10th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

It is past midnight and I have just returned from a Hungarian supper given to the Persian party of the Beloved after a most interesting meeting in the headquarter of the Theosophical Society of Hungary. They are an intelligent set of people, full of animation and zeal. Amongst them there are many young men and women who are working with main and force for the spread of universal brotherhood. They listened with deepest interest to the heavenly address of the Beloved. It was an exposition of divine and material civilization; that although {{p2}} material civilization at present is at a standstill in the Orient, yet it was cradled and originated there and slowly marched toward the western climes. On the other hand the founders of divine civilization were always born in the East. He elucidated the benefits drawn from both kinds of civilization and that in this age they must go hand in hand. Easily, without anyone noticing it, he took another topic, weaving it dextrously into the main subject. He said, that in man there are three realities, physical reality, intellectual reality and spiritual reality. The animals had only one reality and is deprived of the other two. The physical man is co-partner with animal, in sharing the physical reality. Because {{p3}} animals are materialistic, aggressive and blood thirsty so likewise those men who engage in killing their fellowmen are no less and no greater than animals. They are mere brutes, pure and simple. Never you must think for a moment that these man who have been fighting in the Balkans are intelligent beings. They are ferocious beasts. The second reality is Reason or intellect. The founders of this school are the philosophers. The third reality is spiritual and the founders have ever been the prophets of God who have appeared from time immemorial in the orient.

In introducing the Master, Mr. {{p4}} Nadler Robert, the President of Theosophical Society of Hungary said: On behalf of all the brothers and sisters of the Theosophical Society in Hungary many of whom many are present I bid welcome our Master Abdul Baha. I have no doubt that I express the feelings of those who are present that it is the greatest privilege of our lives and our supreme happiness to entertain in our midst one who is such a pure channel of the spirit of God. Many of us have studied these Teachings and have come to admire its progressiveness and its lofty idealism. Last year Mr. Stark kindly delivered before the members of our Society a delightful address on the Bahai Movement which appeared in {{p5}} its entirety in our monthly review. Many of us have imagined that the Oriental nations have instead of going forward, they are taking backward steps. This may be true in certain isolated cases; for all the latest inventions have appeared in the West, great factories have reared their smoking chimneys to the sky, industrialism has advanced and the commercial world by reason of modern discoveries has revolutionized the old methods. However, there are still many ideal Treasures in the East of which we are completely deprived. The western people in striving to discover {{p6}} the physical laws of nature have completely forgotten the spiritual laws of inner life and have overlooked idealism and absolute Reality. We are doing now our utmost effort to gain the lost ground and for this very reason it is with the greatest pleasure that we welcome in our midst the noblest and the sublimest Representative of the spiritual life of the East and we hope that he will feed us tonight with the ideal sustenance which God so abundantly has showered upon him. Abdul Baha, I welcome you with all my heart and soul. Before this introduction Mr. Robert in Hungarian language spoke briefly of the history of the Cause and its marvellous progress in this century.

When the Beloved finished speaking the President in thanking him said: My dear Master. My tongue is unable to express our thanks for the eloquent and righteous words you have spoken to us tonight. It is true that I am expressing the feelings of all those who are present that we are deeply grateful to God for this rare privilege of your presence. When the heart is filled with feelings, the tongue is mute and dumb, because it cannot find adequate words to clothes his thoughts and longing. Therefore I only thank you in the name {{p8}} of those who are present.

The Master answered: Our hearts like unto pure mirrors receive the impressions and these spiritual images are reflected from one mirror upon another without the medium of language. As spiritual susceptibilities have encircled us tonight and as the mirrors of the hearts are pure, therefore we can understand each other. No matter how eloquent and oratorical the outward tongue, it cannot adequately express the riches of the spirit. The eloquent tongue is the tongue of consciousness. Praise be to God that the tongue is explaining the real feelings of the hearts and expresses our spiritual susceptibilities. Therefore {{p9}} I too with the tongue of consciousness express my gratitude to you in being so patient and so good to listen to me tonight. I shall never forget this love on your part and I will ever remember you and will beg for all of you divine Confirmations. It was announced that all those who would like to see the Beloved may call on him in the mornings from nine to twelve. After shaking hands with all the present members of the Society we departed for the hotel.

In the morning we were happy to see the Master in good {{p10}} health and happy. He spoke to us about Baha-wllah and while looking from the window upon the broad river, he said, how the Blessed Perfections loved such places and how he would have enjoyed these scenes, were he here. Then Mr. Herrigel came in and he translated two German papers that had quite long articles about the Cause. The rest were in Hungarian. Here are the names of some of the papers which I am sending you in a separate package; Theosofia; Magyar Hirlap; Az Ujsag; Nap; Pesti Hirlap; Newes Pester Journal; Pester Lloyd; Pesti Napld; Pesti Hirlap, Vilag, Pesti Tuiker. Strange names and papers to contain articles on the Cause! You may find in New York some Hungarian gentlemen to translate them for you.

{{p11}}

Mr. and Mrs. Moore with his two boys of eleven and seven years called on the Beloved. The Master immediately loved Charles, the smaller boy and carried with him a long conversation about taking him to the Orient, giving him white donkeys and ponies and letting him play with the children on Mount Carmel. While he was sitting on his lap, the Master asked him to let his hands become limp and bring his head forward, when suddenly he took one of the hands and gently slap his own face. The boy thought clever trick was played upon him. Speaking to him about the <p12? white small donkeys of Cairo, Abdul Baha told us the following story. There were two men who meet each other in Cairo. A. said to B. that "I saw today in the market three donkeys". "Yes! how did they looked?" B. asked. "The first was a white donkey which was valued for one hundred English pounds, the second was the one I wanted to buy and the third was the owner who did not want to sell it."

About eleven o'clock the Master took us from a walk and the little child, Charles, asked his mother's permission to join us. "All right" the mother answered "you can go and I will wait for you in the hotel till you return." Later he told his father: Oh! I love the Master very much! I wish so much I could travel with him {{p13}} and speak with him without any interpreter." The child "Mr. Moore told me in the evening after the Theosophical meeting" is filled with the Master. He speaks of him all the time.

Crossing one bridge over the other side we met our Hindu gentleman and the Master spoke to him about the expectation of the Theosophists in regard to the coming of the Universal Master. The Manifestation of God, he said, is not taught in college. He does not need human knowledge. He is here to teach and not to be taught. He is to lead and not to be led. He is an educator and not educated.

{{p14}}

A man came to him and asked for his autograph on a newspaper containing an article on the Cause. I will write my signature in English for you, the Master said. Without hesitation the unknown man answered: In whatever language you write, it is the signature of the Master and of the lover of mankind and I will treasure it just the same.

An Englishman who had lived in Budapest for five years being attracted by the Master's appearance came to us and spoke, introduced himself. He had a pleasant face and the Beloved spoke with him. "May I come one day and take you around and show you this wonderful palace overhanging above our heads?" Abdul Baha said: You are {{p15}} always welcomed both you and your friends. But can you take us through the Eternal palace of God? That palace is heavenly, it is never destroyed and its foundation is firm! At first our Englishman could not understand what the Master meant but after repeating the same idea in different form, he got a glimpse of it. He said, he will bring his sister and his brother to see the Master tomorrow morning.

The Beloved took a carriage to return to the hotel, because he had an engagement and the little Charles returned with {{p16}} him. The Master had him in his lap, kissing and caressing him and saying sweet words to him. When we arrived Mrs. Anna Fipernowsky of the International Peace Bureau of Bern, Prof. Nadler Robert, Dr. Geza Vikar, Mr. L Stark were waiting for his arrival. He took them with himself to his room and after talking over the arrangement of the meeting tonight, the Hungarian history was discussed. Abdul Baha told them that he had many intimate friends amongst the Hungarians. They were his intimate associates. When Russia, Germany and Austria combined together and crushed the Hungarian longing for Independence, many generals and soldiers {{p17}} migrated to Turkey and were received with great honor. The Turkish government gave to each one an important military position and many of them were given titles of Pashas. But these Hungarian immigrants changed their names and choose for themselves, Turkish names. He mentioned the names of several of those men who were well-known to our present friends and who knew him most intimately. They were all delighted with the sympathy {{p18}} and knowledge of the Master and there and then an invisible link of friendship was established! The Master had his lunch in the hotel all alone. In the afternoon the Hindu gentleman, Nandor de Eizel Secretary of the Consul General of Turkey, Abdul Latif Effendi, the President of the Islami Association and the Consul General of Turkey who is at the same time the Persian Consul came and prayed their homage and respect to the Beloved and each one stared a long time with him.

One of the Hungarian papers had a story that the Master's {{p19}} wealth was valued at fifteen million dollars. When we told him this, he had a good laugh over it. "All right", he said. "We have them a good credit? May we borrow a million from the Hungarian National Bank?" When the waiter come to me with the above story, asking me to verify it. I said: The whole world belongs to Abdul Baha. He is richer than all the Kings and Emperors of the Earth. They are all beggars in His Presence. He stared at me with wonder and surprise in his face. Was that really so?" {{p20}} "Sure" I answered. "Then, do I have a chance to enter into his service?" he eagerly asked.

At five o'clock the Master with all of us following him walked along France Joseph strass in front of the river. It is the promenading boulevard of the whole city. Several people accosted him and talked. Especially there was an old man with white beard and with fez exactly like the Master, except that his fez was red. He was a Hungarian and because he had stayed 20 years in Constantinople and associated with the Persians, he could speak the language quite freely. Arriving in the hotel the Master rested for a while and the Mr. Stark and Mr. Nadler Robert came to take him to the Theosophical Society.



### Hotel Ritz Budapest April 11th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Although few had heard about the Bahai Cause in Budapest before the Beloved's arrival, for the last three days the interest on the part of the public has been growing in size and dimension. The papers have written interesting articles and today I mailed to you a big package of German and Hungarian newspapers containing some long and short accounts. They are uniformly dignified in tone and many people have come to the hotel because they have read articles in the dailies and are very much attracted to the Cause. The Beloved seeing this manifest interest on the part of public is very pleased and said that, the future of the Cause in Hungary will be very great and many people shall enter the Kingdom of God. When the seeds are scattered in a pure and fertile ground they will grow very quickly.

{{p2}}

Today I received a letter from one of the City of Hungary called Vac'z. The writer say, "I have read in yesterday's daily papers something about "Bahaismus" which greatly interested me. In fact, I feel that "Bahaismus" is the real, true religion which fills the mind with real, lofty ideals and assists mankind to develop its better self. I would therefore esteem it a favor if you should kindly write me where I could obtain the 'Bahaismus' literature".

{{p3}}

As a result of last night's meeting in the Theosophical Society at 20 Iranyi Utca many people came this morning to hear the Master and ask questions on various puzzling problems which today are occupying the minds of the public. A Hungarian who spoke French fluently asked about Love and God. The Master promptly told him that he to love God let him love his fellowmen. In them he can see the image and likeness of God. If he was eager to serve God let him serve mankind; let him lose his self in the self of God. When the aerial mariner steers his airship skyward, little by little, the in harmony and incongruity of the world of nature are lost and before his astonished eyes, he sees, widespread, the wonderful, harmonious panorama of God's creation. Likewise when the student of the Path of Reality has attained to the loftiest summit of divine Love, he will not look upon the ugliness and misery of mankind, he will not observe any differences, he will not see any racial and patriotic misfits but he will look upon humanity with the glorified vision of a seen and a prophet. Let us all strive that we may attain to this highest pinnacle of ideal and spiritual life.

{{p4}}

Some of the newspapers containing articles on the Cause were translated to the Master and although he did not make any comment, was pleased with their contents.

{{p5}}

Prof. Germanus and a friend of his who was going to the Orient came and the master spoke to them on the Eastern customs and it was arranged that he would be taken away to the Parliament building at 7 o'clock that evening where he was going to address a public meeting in the house of the Representatives of the Hungarian nations.

{{p6}}

A large delegation of the Theosophists belonging to the White Lodge of the Star of the East were presented to the Beloved with bouquets of flowers in their hands. Their leader, a bright and intellectual woman asked the Master what the conditions for the coming of the Great Master were. "We are taught" she said, "That soon the Saviour of the world shall come and once a week we gather together and contemplate on the coming of the Master. Our next meeting will be tomorrow at 6:30 pm and we will be greatly honored if you could come. The Master accepted graciously their invitation and then said: Praise be to God that means were brought about that he may come to Budapest and associate with them. He was very pleased with their last night meeting. It was a most ideal gathering. The spiritual susceptibilities had encircled the hearts. He hoped that day unto day these feelings and communications may increase so that the City of Budapest may become the center of the appearance of the principles of the oneness of the world of humanity and the lights may be spread from this place to all parts of Europe.

{{p7}}

Now as to the coming of the great Master. His appearance must be dependent upon the realization of certain conditions. Investigate the reality and in whomsoever these conditions are fulfilled, know ye of a certainty that he is the Great Master.

Firstly: That great Master will be the Educator of the world of humanity.

Secondly: His teachings must be universal and confer illumination upon humankind.

Thirdly: His knowledge must be innate and spontaneous and not acquired.

Fourthly: He must answer the questions of all the ages, solve all the difficult problems of humanity and be able to withstand all the persecutions and sufferings heaped upon him.

Fifthly: He must be a joy-bringer and the Herald of the Kingdom of Happiness.

Sixthly: His Knowledge must be infinite and his wisdom all comprehensive.

Seventhly: The penetration of His Word and the potency of influence must be so great as to humble even his worst enemies.

Eighthly: Sorrows and tribulations must not vex him. His courage and conviction must be God-like. Day unto day he must become firmer and more zealous.

Ninthly: He must be the Establisher of Universal Civilization; the Unifier of religious, the standard-bearer of universal Peace and the embodiment of all the highest and noblest virtues of the world of humanity. Wherever you find these conditions realized in a human temple turn to him for guidance and illumination.

The listeners were touched extremely but if I had my way, I would have cried at the top of my voice, that person, that Great Master they are so anxious about his coming was before their very eyes. The desire of their hearts hath come, why this needless expectation?

{{p8}}

Mr. O.M.A. Frosell who met the Master the other day in the street came to see him with his brother. They are two very excellent young men and are much attracted. After welcoming them he said: It is very good that we made each other's acquaintance without any formal introduction, right in the street. This was much better you have a very progressive city. it is very delightful, the inhabitants also are wide-awake. Praise be to God that in Budapest one feels the spiritual emotions; many people are investigating the fundamental realities of life; their desire is to reach at the core of everything. Hungary has given us many thinkers, many linguists, generals and dramatists. I hope they will become informed with the world of God, be acquainted with the Mysteries of the Kingdom. May they become radiant, illumined and Merciful! In short, he had grown to love Budapest and its inhabitants; Stuttgart and its people. Just as there are political treaties between European nations, may heavenly treaties bind them eternally together. The heavenly treaties are inviolable and cannot be dissolved, but political treaties may be broken roughshod within a few hours. It was his hope that those indissoluble treaties may be created between all the people. Now in European countries, materialism is stalking abroad, seemingly victorious; then the ideal powers of spirituality will gain the ascendency!

{{p9}}

He asked whether the Master had seen any of the sight of the beautiful Budapest. He answered that he had come here to see men and not piles of stones and clay. These buildings you can find everywhere; for his part he was searching for men. Buildings are many, men are few. There are even so many palaces in this world. There have been great palaces built by the ancient Kings and today not a stone has been left to tell the sad story of their decay. The present palaces will go through the same process of destruction. When you lay the foundation of a wonderful palace, at that very moment you must think that a day shall come- it may be a hundred years, one thousand years- ten or 20 thousand years- when not one stone of your palace will be left.

But the divine Palace shall never be destroyed, its traces are eternal. He desired them to see that palace. That everlasting palace is the reality of man which reality is indestructible. Therefore he was searching throughout the world to find men and women in whom the divine palace was completed. In this heart of every man and woman the construction of this heavenly palace was going on. Praiseworthy deeds and philanthropic actions were the materials with which the palace was built. Vices and negligence of God's laws were the axes with which the very foundation of this eternal palace laid by the hand of God was uprooted.

Amongst those who were present was a young man who had traveled throughout the world and spoke many language. The following Conversation was carried along between him and the Master to the delight and profit of all:

A.B.: Now that you have seen many parts of the world, I hope you will also make a voyage to the country of Baha.

M.F.: I have never heard the name of such a country in my life.

A.B.: How strange! There are thousands of people who have been there and upon their return have given glowing accounts of their experiences.

M.F.: Have they written any books?

A.B.: I think they have. But they could not find adequate words to describe their impressions.

M.F.: Have you seen any of these travelers after their return from the city of Baha.

A.B.: Yes.

M.F.: What do they say?

A.B.: They say, the country of Baha is the most beautiful and artistic city they have ever seen.

M.F.: I would like to get some particulars about it. When could I inform myself? I may decide to go there if it is worth while.

A.B.: They have reported that the country of Baha has the most equitable weather, perennial spring reigns throughout all the seasons; there is neither the heat of the summer nor the forlorn outlook of autumn or the frost of the winter. Its gardens are ever abloom, its fragrant flowers are imperishable, its fountains are at all time flowing, its birds are always singing, its happiness is not alloyed with sorrow, its sun is never set, its stars are ever twinkling, its day is not followed by any night, its moon is eternally full.

M.F.: Oh! How wonderful! I would like to go there! It must be an ideal country!

A.B.: It is a very extraordinary country. Its inhabitants are all angels and they speak one universal language.

M.F.: Then everybody understands each other? It is not like Hungary where one must speak many languages? How can I reach then quickly?

A.B.: Come! Come! I will be thy guide. I will take thee through its broad avenues shaded by verdant, never-fading trees. I will unfold before thy vision, the most heavenly panorama, the like of which thou hast never seen. I will, little by little teach thee the secrets of the ever-changing hues of its flowers, the murmuring of its breezes and the divine notes of its music. I will take thee through its imperial palaces and I will show thee the most wonderful scenes.

M.F.: When should I make myself ready to start with you?

A.B.: Now.

M.F.: I believe my brother would like to accompany us. May I go and fetch him?

A.B.: All right.

When these people left a delegation of more than 25 young men from the Oriental Commercial University headed by a very excellent orator entered the room. He had a nosegay of roses in his hand and while all the rest were standing behind him he delivered a very powerful address greeting "Our prophet from the Orient" in the warmest and sincerest terms and then offered the nosegay into his hands. The Master delivered in turn a  strong speech on the closer relations between the East and the West and hoped they will do their share in this great service.

{{p12}}

The President of the Touranian Society with a high military officer and several others were presented. After hearing the Master speak on the two essential aspects of universal Peace Mr. Paikert Alajos requested him to deliver an address on Monday at 6 pm before the members of Touranian Society in the Senate chamber of Hungary.

{{p13}}

Many more people were presented and at last it was long after one o'clock before the Beloved could free himself to go to the studies of Mr. Nodler Robert in the National School of Art so that he may make a painting of him. Mr. Robert was with us and when we arrived he had everything ready and started to work. After on hour, we returned to the hotel, the Master ate his lunch and retired to rest to be ready for four o'clock to go out with one Indian nobleman to call on Prof. Vambery and Prof. Ignaj Goldziher.

{{p14}}

We found Prof. Vambery home. He was waiting. He is a famous orientalist, is 82 years now, has traveled throughout Persia, Turkey, Russia etc. for many years has written many authoritative books on Eastern question speaks Persian and turkish like natives and has been in Persia for more than 14 years under the guise of a Mohamadan servant. For one month he was the guest of the chief of the Ulemas of Esphaban and nobody detected him that he was a European. He considered this day as the greatest day of his life, because the Beloved called on him. They talked together more than one hour on Persia, on America etc. He showed us the photograph that was taken of him when he was travelling as a Mohamadan Mollah. Prof. Vambery is very famous throughout Europe for his services and his works and his word has been always accepted on Eastern question as authoritative.

{{p15}}

From there we drove to Prof. Goldziher. Mr. Stark and Prof. Germames were waiting at the door to greet the Master. He was taken up stair and introduced to Prof. Goldziher. He is an Arabic scholar of great erudition and his library of the Bahai literature was quite unique. Here we found several works of Baha-Ullah translated into Russian, especially the Ketab-El Akdas; here I saw a copy of the Star of the West having the article on the departure of Mr. Chase; many newspaper clipping, especially the one containing the Master's letter to Cornegic and then a letter from Mrs. True giving a short account of the Mastekal Azkar.

Prof. Goldziher has delivered a series of lectures on Islam and one of these addresses is on the Bahai Movement. These articles have been already published- a book. The book is in  German and as he told me, a Philadelphia lady is now engaged in translating it into English. The Master carried along with him a most interesting conversation in Arabic on the early history of the Cause and he was so happy to have the Beloved in his home.

{{p16}}

From here we drove to the old Parliament building. at first the Master was taken into one of the Committee rooms and the chairman of the meeting was introduced. Doctor Geeswive is a most prominent Catholic priest and is the president of the Peace Society of Hungary. When the Master entered the Parliament there were more than 800 people present and every lady spontaneously arose from his seat. After the introduction by the President, the Master delivered a powerful address on international Peace, Esperanto, Suffrage and the closer relation between the East and the West. When the Master spoke on suffrage the audience became wild with enthusiasm and applauded again and again. It was a remarkable demonstration, considering the fact that the words of the Beloved had to be translated by two interpreters and our Hungarian translator was not at all equal to the task. Mr. Stark translated much better the other night. When the Master finished his talk they applauded for a long time. They left their seats and crowded around the platform. Again the Beloved spoke a few appreciate words of thanks. Entering the private room many prominent men and women came in to thank him for his encouraging words. Tired and fatigued from the excessive amount of talking we returned to the hotel, had our dinner and went to sleep.

Dear Harriet!

"The lamp of God is in the utmost of luminosity in the city of Budapest. Large meetings are held and detailed addresses delivered." This was the text of the telegram which was forwarded by the Beloved to many cities of the East and the West. I am sure all the believers will be delighted to receive this glad news of the spread of the Kingdom of Abha and the further spiritual triumphs of Abdul Baha. His power and majesty, his simplicity and humility are witnessed and admired by all men. People are trying to emulate him in every station in life.

{{p2}}

During the days of our passage from New York to England, the Master dictated a number of Tablets for the American believers. They were copied in turn by Mirza Mahmoud and given back to him for correction. For the last four months they were left in his handbag till just a day before leaving the Paris he gave them to me for translation. While in Stuttgart I was so busy that I could not attend to this but today I availed myself of the opportunity and sat behind my writing desk and translated them all. Apropos of this delay, the Master said that he never wrote to the people just for the sake of writing. He had definite, specific object in writing. HIs letters were the results of deep cogitation and contemplation. Often over one sentence in a letter he thought all night; even it had happened that at times he thought in sleep. Once he wanted to write a letter to a certain important person and he thought over it one year. Another time he wrote a letter to a person and kept it in his handbag for 10 months. The wisdom of these postponements have always appeared later. His letters were the results of deep thought and not the superficial expressions which appeared today and disappeared tomorrow.

{{p3}}

One of the interesting personalities that came this afternoon to meet the Master was a Jewish Rabbi. He had heard last night his talk and he came today to agree with him that the equality of the sexes and universal language were not necessary and that Christ of whom he spoke with such reverence did not bring anything new into this world may rather be caused the dispersion of the Jews to the four corners of the earth. The Master listened to him with a twinkle of amusement in his eyes. Then he started to speak and step by step the Rabbi forced to accept the logic of the Beloved and he left the room happy and satisfied. The wonder of the Master lies in the fact that no one leaves his presence with a better sense of defeat, but with a happy heart; happy, because he has been able to learn something he did not know or that he knew only very dimly.

{{p4}}

The President of Touranian Society came and another long discussion on the subject of international peace was carried on. "Your aim, of course is the realization of universal Peace. Abdul Baha said, but with what power or with what executive force will you be able to bring it about? He hoped that the President will find this propelling power so that he would be assisted. In the matter of universal Peace, a great universal Power was necessary, which, we may name a "Universal Collection Center". In the past there have appeared several "Collective Centers". These "Collective Centers" not being general in their various aspects have given only limited results. One of the "Collective Centers" has been and is yet considered the "spirit of nationalism". This "spirit" has brought together the various individual members of different tribes and communities into one "Collective Center" called a "nation". For example the different petty principalities of Germany for a long time worked against each other's interests, jealously protecting their so called "freedom". The "spirit of nationalism" which was meant to become a most powerful "Collective Center" was born through the genius of Bismarck. Again the birth of this "spirit" was evidenced in America in the union of the states through the wisdom of Washington, Franklin and Jefferson. In like manner other nations have come into being at various period of human history when the "spirit of nationalism" was born and the existence of the "Collective Center" felt essential.

Another "Collective  Center" is patriotism; the watchword and the battle-cry of the present nations. A third "Collective Center" is politics. It is evident that the interest of one nation is in the loss to another and we can see that as long as these three "Collective Centers" are dominant in the affairs of the world, Universal Peace will not be realized. These "nations" look upon each other with the series of difference; they try to improve the conditions of their native, countries at the expense of others and their interests clash and came within the range of conflict. Therefore all these "collective centers" instead of helping the cause of international Peace they prevent its realization. Consequently in this illumined century, the intellectual evolution of humanity has advanced far enough as to create a "Universal Collective Center" around which all the nations may revolve, thus sacrificing their petty interests for the progress of the whole. When the Beloved went on speaking of Baha-Ullah and the "Divine Universal Collective Center" which he has created and how all the nations and religions will ultimately came under its influence. The audience was astonished at the wonderful felicity of the Beloved's ideas. "I am really astonished" he said, "to hear such a marvelous exposition of universal Peace from an Easterner and I am more than  glad to know that such a universal Cause has appeared in the Orient."

{{p5}}

The Beloved dined in the hotel and at four o'clock, after having tea, he called at the office of Consul General of Turkey. He was a polished gentlemen and was last night in the meeting. He was most pleased because the Master referred to the Balkan situation in his speech.

{{p6}}

After two hours of conversation Abdul Baha attended the meeting of members of the Star of the East in the headquarter of the Theosophical Society. There were a large number a bright-looking men and women, very intelligent and full of animation. The Master sat in a large chair and the meeting was opened by 5 minutes silence after which the President read the following prayer in Hungarian for the coming of the Universal Teacher:

>>"Master of the Great White Lodge,
Lord of the Religions of the World!
Come down again to the earth that needs Thee.
And help the nations that are longing for Thy Presence.
Speak the word of peace that the people may cease from quarrellings.
Speak the word of Brotherhood that the warring classes and Castes may know themselves as one.
Come in the night of Thy Love
Come in the splendor of Thy Power
And save the world that is longing for Thy coming
Thou the teachers alike of handles and of men."<<

Another five minutes of silence and then the President requested "the Master to teach us. We are all Thy pupils and are now sitting at thy feet to learn the Mysteries of the Kingdom and of life". Then the Master stated that was much as they have already heard the name of Baha-Ullah he would like to relate to them tonight the history of his life. It was most wonderful to hear him speak about his great Father. He is the only person who can speak about him with emotions and holy feeling. The address was translated into English and then by a very clever and cultivated lady into Hungarian. She did it very well and I was pleased. The audience listened with the rapt attention seldom witnessed anywhere. They were interested deeply, movingly.

{{p7}}

when he finished his great heavenly address, he delivered an invocation in their behalf. Here I give you a translation of prayer:

O Thou Compassionate Lord! Illumine these hearts with the light of the Most Great Guidance! Confer life upon these spirits through the divine glad tidings! Enlighten these eyes by beholding the splendors of Thy Sun! Make these ears hearing by hearkening Thy most glorious Call! Suffer them to enter in the Kingdom of Thy Holiness! Resuscitate them through the Breaths of Thy Holy Spirit! Grant them eternal life! Bestow upon them heavenly perfections! O God! Sacrifice our lives for Thy self! Give us a new spirit! Clear our vision with Thy spiritual Power! Surround us with Thy eternal joy! Confirm us in the service of the world of humanity! Make us the cause of good fellowship between the hearts! O God! Awaken us from the deep slumber of negligence! Suffer us to become merciful and aware! So that one may become informed with the Mysteries of the Holy Books and comprehend the allegories of the spiritual utterances. Verily Thou art the Powerful! Thou art the Giver! And Thou art the Kind!

The President thanked Abdul Baha for his wonderful address and the heavenly benediction of his prayers. "This day will be remembered during all our lives and we request the Master to remember us in his prayers". After a few more words from the Beloved they all gathered around him, kissing his hands and expressing  such deep love and respect that one could never express in words.

{{p8}}

On his return to the hotel Sirdor and his wife called on him. Our Sirdor, the Indian gentleman has a very charming Hungarian wife who speaks English fluently and is very talented. They are living happily in Budapest. The Sirdor met her in India and they were married. Both are very much attracted to the Cause and love the Master. They invited him to have tea in their apartment tomorrow afternoon so that he may bless their two months baby. "I want to bring her up as a Bahai" she said. "This is the only religion in the world that I would like her to believe and practice".

Love to all

Dear Harriet!

As I looked out of the window this morning my eyes beheld a wonderful scene! It was snowing! But how? Already one foot of snow had covered the field and the air was filled with its fleecy white particles! The wind was blowing violently, carrying the snowflakes wither and thither. At this time of the year the snow may not be considered unusual in Hungary but I looked at it with much interest. In reality this year did not experience the seventy of winter but for the last three days we have felt it in Budapest. Early in the morning the Beloved called us to him and gave to each a cup of tea. "Come here" he said, "and look out of the window! How all nature, the trees, the mountains, the houses, the Danube, the streets are wearing the white garment of the angels." Snow is the sign of purity. Just as this snow is white so man's consciousness must be adorned with the mantle of purity. This is also a token of the Mercy of God to the people. The future of the Cause in this city will be as white as the garment of the snow with which Budapest is clothed by God.

{{p2}}

Speaking about last night's meeting the Master said: If the speaker's intention be pure, if his heart be transparent, no matter through how many translators the words may go, the audience will be touched. After Mohamad, many great orators appeared in the Islamic religion. One of these orators who wielded a tremendous power over his audience, swaying their emotions towards any direction he intended was Hassan Khargani. This orator had a son who had studied philosophy and sciences and considered himself secretly greater than his father. He marveled at the simple words of his father, playing such wonderful affect upon the hearts of his hearers. Then he said to himself, if these people were so touched by the simple preaching of his father, how greatly will they be affected if he preached to them. Then he asked his father to give him permission to go and preach in his stead. The father gladly assented. The son, then ascending the platform took as his text one of the most difficult verses of the Khoran and round it he wove many subtle interpretations, philosophic anxious etc. The audience was not only not moved but to distraction bored at such a dry sermon and instead listening to him the began to speak amongst themselves. He was disgusted and having the platform went home angry with himself and the stupid people. The father knew this but did not say anything. Next day he took the hand of his son and went to the Mosque to preach. As soon as the people saw Hassan Khargani was going to preach, a deep silence fell upon them. Hassan went up to the pulpit and after looking tenderly into the eyes of his audience, he said: My friends! Last night something very important transpired in our quarter. We have a neighbor a very old woman. She is eighty years old; laden with age. She is a holy woman. She prays all night and serves the people all day. She had a goat and her milk was the source of her livelihood. She had no other means of support.

Now, my dear friends, she is sorely tried, because the she-goat died and she is left all alone and helpless in this world. He went on to picture her saintly life, and her unselfish deeds. The audience was so moved by this sniffle story that not only may wept but a crowd came forward offering aid and assistance. When Hassan left the mosque with his son, he turned to him and said: Did you see how a simple story stirred the audience to its depth? You must purify your heart. This is the most important thing, otherwise all your learning and philosophy will not assist you. Now in Budapest the Confirmations of God are with us, otherwise how could a large audience like last night be moved and interested through two translators? 

{{p3}}

Although the snow was falling heavily, many people from the Esperanto Society and the Theosophical and Peace Societies called on the Master. Almost everyone had either a photograph of Abdul Baha from "Vahan" or a card to be autographed by him. I believe it is a fashion here to request important personages to sign their names on the hack of ones card.

{{p4}}

In speaking with the President of the Star of the East he said: I was most pleased with last night's meeting. I spoke to you on the history of the life of Baha-Ullah. Now is the beginning of the progress of the Bahai Cause in Europe; it is the hour of the early mourn. Ere long the sun shall rise and station itself in the zest of its glory. During the life of Christ, people did not accept his Cause. They ridiculed him and his disciples. It was only after 300 years that Christianity was established in some parts of Europe but the Cause of Baha-Ullah during the last 60 years has covered the East and the West. While in America we traveled as far as Los Angeles and everywhere we found Bahais, even in the Islands of Honolulu there is a Bahai Assembly. Wherever you go you find these souls working for the progress of humanity and the promotion of international Peace. Now this light is enkindled in Budapest; these seeds are scattered in this field. We have brought this torch to Hungary to ignite the hearts and transform them into palaces of lights. We have carried with us these seeds and have already sown them. I hope they will grow and develop. This great tree was once within a seed.

{{p5}}

To the members of the Star of the East he said: If the Confirmation of Baha-Ullah surround your society, it will develop very quickly and you will be enabled to render great services.

{{p6}}

Several Turks, Arabs and a Persian came to see him. Here in Budapest we have only one Persian, a merchant of rugs by the name of Abbas Aga. He has been here for several years and speaks Hungarian quite well.

{{p7}}

At half past two, the Master accompanied by myself, although cold and snowing called on Mr. Nadler Robert in the College of Art to give him another setting for the very wonderful painting he is making of Abdul Baha. As he lives on the fourth floor and the building had no elevator it was very fatiguing to mount the steps.

{{p8}}

On the way he spoke of the strength of his youth: You are young and strong. When I was at your age I never felt the cold. I loved the snow. I was strong enough to wrestle with a bear. Here with my fist I would have liked to go for him.

{{p9}}

After spending more than one hour in the studio we took a carriage to call on our Indian Sorder and his wife at Szilagyi Dexsater.

On the way in the carriage the Master spoke very tenderly about Baha-Ullah: For nine years he did not see a green leaf. He loved nature. His sensibilities and powers of observation were miraculous! The tips of his fingers were the most sensitive parts of his holy temple. His sense of smell was most keen. If he walked along this avenue although, his mind was occupied with other thoughts, he would on his arrival home relate most profitably every small detail of the Urobtling life. Often he would order us to go and prepare tea five or six miles away from the city because one could see there a patch of green or a five tree. He would cut a cucumber into two pieces and smell only its odor and enjoy it as though he had eaten it. While dictating Tablets to his secretary at a rapid rate, he had papers in his hand and writing on some entirely different topic and now and then carried an interesting conversation with those who were present and suddenly the would raise his head and point to us from the window a wonderful tall, noble tree in a garden far away. One occupation never prevented him from attending to other things.

{{p10}}

Our Indian Sirdor had a beautiful apartment, part Oriental and Western. The Master and the rest of the guests were served tea and refreshments. He looked around the large rooms and after blessing the little baby returned to the hotel.

{{p11}}

In the evening an American and his wife from New York who are traveling through Europe with a few Hungarians called the Master. He spoke to them about the gross materialism of the French people and how the Americans are a noble nation of investigators of Reality. They enjoyed his talk very much; for the materialism of the agnostics was likened into the materialism of the cow who does not know anything about God and is out of touch with His Kingdom. The materialists believe in what they see, so does the cow. The former sees the flower and believes in it, the latter sees the meadow and the cooling spring and believes in it.

Dear Harriet!

The snowstorm continues, the wind is blowing at a terrific velocity. More than 6000 telephone lines are affected, gardens are uprooted and all the blossoming trees destroyed. Much damage is done and communication, by telegraph and telephone is very difficult. I tried to get hold of several people over the phone; it was impossible, the wires are either cut off or disorganized. Availing ourselves of this opportunity this morning, we wrapped packages of Hungarian and German newspapers and the Master attended to his mail.

{{p2}}

Notwithstanding the weather several important people came to see him but each one stayed a few minutes and conversation was limited. Last night when the Master was speaking to our American friends on the unreliability of the criterion of the sense, Mr. Moore with his two sons were present. On his return home, he was astonished to hear his eldest son- 11 years old- reciting the talk of Abdul Baha almost word for word to her mother. An American woman, visiting Mr. Moore became so interested that she said that she must call on the Master before he leaves Budapest. This morning she came in led by the child into the Master's presence. She said: Charles is always talking about you, by day and by night!

{{p3}}

About noon the weather was cleared and the Master hiring a carriage we drove to the home of the Turkish Consul General to bid him farewell. For a long time they spoke together on the crucial situation of Asia. I have seldom heard the Master speaking with such fiery animation; his facial and hand gestures were the most remarkable. Often when the Master is under the spell of the spirit, every little while, he takes off his turban, arranges his hair and puts it on again. This is done so unconsciously, so gracefully that one is charmed and delighted. He spoke all the time in Turkish, his voice high and sweet, his tone determined and earnest, his face aflame with the light of love and pity, his eyes twinkling like two globes of fire, his countenance now stern, now wreathed with the sun-kissed smiles of the angels, his hands swiftly moving up and down, now showing the palm, again two or three fingers and at all time portraying most graphically his feelings and emotions! When he is swayed by these superhuman inspirations just sit in a corner and oblivious of all other things, watch him.

{{p4}}

One of his remarks was the following: Today the armies of Europe, well-drilled, well-provisioned, phalanx-like are similar unto the waves of the ocean-pounding against the shores of Asia. Asia in her present state cannot stand before these irresistible, victory-inspired armies. There is not only the army of war to contend with; there are other more influential, economic armies that surround the Eastern countries. There is an army of commerce, an army of industry, an army of agriculture, an army of sciences and arts. All these well-disciplined hosts, supplied with the latest modern methods and instruments are bent upon great conquests in their respective fields. They are constantly gathering greater momentum to carry their final assault. Asia is pressed from all sides and no matter toward what horizon she may look anxiously for a ray of hope- so that she may be delivered from this death- she cannot see but threatening clouds. The only deliverer for her in this day is the Cause of Baha-Ullah. Because this movement teaches the oneness of the world of humanity and universal Peace. The Asiatic nations must become united together, not against the West, not on the basis of antagonism and religious prejudice. They must become united on the principle of reality, forget all their dogmas and hold fast to one divine Reality. A union of all the Asiatic countries on such a basis of friendship and co-operation with all humanity will be welcomed by the Western nations. But an offensive and defensive union will fail to accomplish this purpose. The greatest means of such a union is the universal language. It is most certain and indubitable that the universal language will completely wipe away all the differences from amongst mankind. This is clear and does not need any proof. Then he spoke on the fundamental unity of the divine religions and how in San Francisco in a Jewish Synagogue, he established this fact. Then speaking about his prison day he said: Abdul Hamad often used to say: "What can I do with this man! I have imprisoned him in the barrack of Acca, he attracts unto himself the people of America! It is most marvelous! How does he do it?"

{{p5}}

From the Consul General's house we went to call once more on Professor Vambery. Here again more than two hours they talked together in Persian and Turkish. Prof. Vambery telling interesting reminiscences of his journeys throughout Oriental countries. He was much interested in the Cause and begged the Master to permit him to write a series of articles in European papers. He is a man that all Europe listens and his opinions is sought after by the statesmen and diplomatists.

{{p6}}

Returning to the hotel it was 4:30 pm. Lunch was ordered to the Master's room and I had the great privilege to eat with him. After that he rested for awhile and at 6 o'clock Mr. Paikert Alajos, the President of the Touranian Society came to take him to the meeting which was arranged by this Society for him to address its members and the public. The meeting was held in the national museum, the former Senate of the Hungarian Parliament, in the very chamber where the Senators used to sit before the New Parliament was built a few years ago. It is a most magnificent marble buildings! Although the weather was inclement yet several hundreds were present. The President spoke very briefly, just expressing his deep pleasure and gratitude to the Master for accepting the invitation of the Touranian Society. Everybody was on their feet when the Beloved entered the Senate Chamber and gave him a rousing reception. He first thanked the Society for having such a lofty object as to bring together all the Touranian nations. Then he gave a brief account of the ancient history of Touran and its former civilization, then an account of the Bahai principles and closed his remarks with the life of Gurratreb Agnes. The Society is going to translate the address into Turkish, French and Hungarian and publish it in its bi-monthly review.

{{p7}}

After the meeting the Master was invited to the home of Abbas Aga, the only Persian rug-dealer in Budapest. All the Persians, Mr. Herrigel and Mr. Moore were also invited. There were also several Turks and from 7:30 to eleven thirty the Master spoke to them in Turkish, always illustrating his points with original stories. At 10:30 dinner was served and it consisted of soup, rice, chicken etc. I was glad that even in Budapest there was one Persian who invited the Beloved to his home and spread a very good table for his friends. He considered this feast as the greatest event of his life. He was very good young man and the Master was very kind to him.

Dear Harriet!

The falling of snow is continuing and the wind is blowing. The air is filled with cold. It seems this is a general condition all over Europe. Reports are being received from Germany, Austria, France and England that in many parts of those countries King snow is reigning supreme and expressions of deep regret are being heard right and left of the great loss which shall be entailed upon the farming communities. Abdul felt sorry for all these losses but he assured me that God from this great Treasure shall compensate them. 

I Mr. and Mrs. Leapold Stark who have become the pure channels of introducing the Cause to Hungary are most interesting people. Mr. Stark is a cultured, learned Hungarian, who speaks seven languages very well and his wife speaks six languages very fluently. She is charming, sympathetic, very attractive. Her face is lighted with tenderness and her eyes radiate spiritual rays. She is must talented and active. The very first since I looked into her face, I was attracted to her. Her smile is most pleasant and win some. She has soul-quality. As Mr. Stark says: "the success of these meetings chiefly belongs to my wife, because when she is interested in a Cause {{p3}} she works untiringly and enthusiastically. I have done very little. I am a busy man. "And when you look into the face of Mrs. Stark you are convinced that she is a very rare woman and has exceptional virtues. "We will do everything we can to spread these teachings in Hungary" she impulsively yet deliberately declared to the Master. 'Oh I am so very happy to see the Master so pleased with our humble effort. Really I am myself astonished at the interest manifested all around. People before the coming of the Master were {{p4}} surprised at our daring to invite him to a country wherein no one has heard anything about the Bahai revelation. I was afraid a little myself that perhaps the public and the press will be indifferent but, I said, I will o anything possible and leave the rest in the hand of the Master. Now I am so glad so happy that the Cause is received in Budapest with such seriousness and dignity. We could not do this in a hundred yrs." And here she is a noble, fine, heavenly woman, full of Bahai spirit, courage, hope, optimism and her eyes dancing with a happiness which is not of this world. I may write pages and pages, pressing her qualities and beautiful {{p5}} spirit but if you could see her for one hour you would realize that which is impossible to write! Mr. Stark lived 9 yrs. ago in London for nine months. As he has been always a member of Theosophical Society he became a friend of Mr. A.P. Cattanck who was at the same time interested in the Theosophical Movement. This link of friendship once established between them, they keep in touch with each other through correspondence. About 2 or 3 yrs ago Mr. Cattanack heard about the Bahai Cause {{p6}} and accepted it immediately. Soon afterwards, he sent a package of Bahai literature to his old friend Mr. Stark in Hungary. Mr. Stark having read these writings became greatly interested and studied Baha-ullah's Tablets and books. When he heard last December that Abdul Baha was again in England he wrote without delay to Mr. Cattanack whether he could direct him to once with whom he may correspond about the possibility of Abdul Baha's trip to Hungary. Mr. Cattanack gaves him my address and then he wrote to me at that time, writing the Master on the part of various Societies and offering to pay all the expenses of the trip. The Master told {{p7}} me to write him that he had not accepted anything from any one for his lectures and travelling expenses, that he was trying to follow the injunction of Christ freely you have received freely you give;" that although he could not promise at that time whether he could go to Hungary but it will be well for him to correspond further on the subject when we arrived in Paris. While in Paris I received again Mr. Starks courteous letter and again the answer was postponed to Stuttgart. Upon our arrival in Stuttgart his letter and telegrams were {{p8}} awaiting us and kept us busy till the Master yielded to his urge imitation and told me to send him a wire that he was coming. This was in brief the account of the introduction of the Cause to Hungary which I thought may be of interest to record herein.

This morning the Beloved was going to call on Mr. and Mrs. Stark but as the weather was extremely cold last night, he caught a slight cold and therefore he sent Mr. Herrigel to them with the message that he could not go today but will visit later. Soon Mr. and Mrs. Stark and Mr. Moore came and spoke about the future of the Cause in Hungary. The Master said: The Cause will be spread very much in this {{p9}} country. Blessed souls shall arise to serve the Bahai revelation. They will be the means of the happiness of your hearts. The banner of the Cause shall be unfold over the cities of Hungary. For the present those amongst you who are interested in the Cause, gather together once a week, read the Tablets of Baha-ullah, speak on the Cause and whenever you find a thirst soul, offer him the cup of this salubrious water. Rest you assured that Baha-ullah shall confirm you and you shall be {{p10}} assisted by God in this work! Mr. Stark asked the Master what books he could trusted in. Hungarian so that he may publish and circulate amongst the reading public. He said: Translate the hidden words, the words of Paradise, Tojalleyot, Tarazat, the Bahai proof and other small pamphlets containing short historical accounts you and your wife have rendered already a great service to the Cause of Baha-ullah. I will pray to God that you may always be surrounded with his benedictions. When I have Budapest you correspond with me and let me hear your news.

{{p11}}

To Mrs. Starks who come in the afternoon to inquire about the Master's health he said: I love you and your husband very much, you are my daughter and he is my son. You are the first apostles to introduce the Cause of Bah-ullah to Hungary and this honor shall be handed down to all your future posterity. The numbers of your family shall glorify in you. God shall confirm you always. Rest thou assured I will be always with you and your husband. "I will spare no effort and shall strive all the tribe to promulgate {{p12}} these spiritual principles in Hungary and will do my utmost to serve the Cause" she answered.

Mr. Paikert Alajos of the Touranian Society came to see the Master and brought two beautiful books of the views of Budapest. He spoke on the objects of his Society and left a pamphlet in French detailing its constitution. He said to Abdul Baha; "This Society is eternally blessed because it had the favor and distinction of receiving you. Your words of praise and encouragement will inspire all the future workers of this society."I will pray to God", the Master answered that the circle of the influence of your Society increase daily and may render great services to the world of {{p13}} humanity.

Mr. Herrigel presented the love and greeting of many German fiends and appropriate messages were sent to each. Mr. Herrigel asked how they should conduit the meetings in Stuttgart. He answered: "Gather once a week in a public meeting. Before the meeting begins, one must read a prayer. Afterward they may sing together an all an anthem or a song. This optional. They may do it or not. According to their taste. Then {{p14}} one may give an address, on a Bahai subjects. Then they may read Tablets or extracts from the writings of Baha-ullah such as the hidden words, Forgot etc. or the news or letters received from other Bahai centers. Then with another supplication they may close gathering. The object is: let the metting be spiritual and productive of unity and harmony, so that where you leave it you may feel much better than when you entered. Let the meetings be formless as possible. Crystallization of forms will kill the spirit. Let simplicity progressiveness, naturalness, beauty of ideas, love and fellowship emanate from your meetings. The mother of {{p15}} all the questions is to promote the Cause and spread the Teachings.

Prof. Goldziher cause and the Master talked with him at great length in Arabic. On the knowledge of divinity, the four criteria of knowledge, the transference of the single atom through all the Kingdoms of life. The talk was very long and the professor listened with rapt attention and delight.

A few Arabs and Turks had interviews and the Beloved spoke to them, although {{p16}} he felt very tired.

By chance Mr. Stark dropped in and I gave him the addresses of the Bahais of the various Eastern and American Bahai centers so that he and his wife may keep in touch with the friends of other parts of the world. The Master, then advised him to correspond with as many Bahais centersas he saw. At this time the correspondent of "Az Est" came in to have an interview. The Beloved gave him the aobjects of the Bahai revelation in fifteen principles and also an outline of the economic Bahai plan. The correspondent was extremely interested and went away {{p17}} convinced that this was a wonderful spiritual movement. Mr. Stark translated for him into Hungarian the talk of the Master.


Today I received a nice letter from Consul Sehwarz of Stuttgart. It was full of love for the Master and I may let you have a glimpse at the sincerity of the man by a quoting here a portion of it: "My wife and myself as well as my children were sad when the train left the Stuttgart. But we are so extremely happy having been together with the Master the last week and are still quite under the divine influence of His Presence. We speak of him and the wonderful influence he has made on us and the deep love we felt for {{p18}} him as well as the love he has for us, so we feel very happy. We would do so also  signs of love he has given us by taking on him the troubles of the trip to Mergenthein and the blessings he has given to the paths will be of enormous influence of its future. I am quite deeply grateful to the Master for this great kindness and love. He is all to me, my wife and my children and my whole family. We commonly try to give him back a little bit of the great love he has shown to us by telling to allour friends of Him and the holy Mission he is fulfilling so that Stuttgart may become a firm and strong fortress for His Wishes and Teachings. We all live here in the thought and love of Him. My wife and {{p19}} my children and myself are at all times remembering the Master and the fulfillment of His High Mission. 

We are his pupils and will work so that we may become as he wishes us to be and tell others in order that they may take a shore of the happiness and blessing which are coming from him. Tell the Master that we love him and that we by him for his blessings."

This is a letter written by a German of a very high standing in the community; a strong, practical, solid man, and it shows how {{p20}} the Beloved affects even the strongest mind with his divine love.

Mr. Moore brought gramphone to the hotel and Mirza Mohamad chanted through it the beautiful prayer delivered at the Teosophical Society for their future Bahai Meetings. 

I forgot rather a very important point in writing the story of the country of Baha." In the place where the Master says "Come, come and I will be thy guide" the following sentence is to be inserted : I am a native of that land and will return to it. All the Bahais are the deniers of that country."

Dear Harriet!

The Convention days of Mashregol Azkar in America are approaching and I hope that they may become days pregnant with significance and importance for the future of the Cause. Such practical and spiritual Conventions of Bahais must become like power-houses of heaven by Confirmation and divine Assistance. Each Convention must take into consideration the further promotion of the word of God, the diffusion of the Fragrances of God, the {{p2}} promulgation of the Teaching of God, and the spread of the influence and penetration of the Bahai principles. A Conventional must be the greatest standing-proof of Bahai unity and the symbol of Bahai harmony. Which Abdul Baha is far away he will pray and supplicate at the Presence of God that the results of this Convention may be far-reaching and that all the friends may become encouraged and strengthened by reading the report. May it impart a great joy to the heart of Abdul Baha! May it spiritual effect permeable to all parts of the world! May it render a great service to the Cause of international Peace! May its stars ever shine! May its flowers ever diffuse {{p3}} sweet fragrances! May its holy influence be felt by all the people on the face of the earth! May its gentle breezes of love and affection ever waft! May its noble trees yield luscious fruits! May its crystalline water alloy the thirst of the thirsty ones! May its divine table satisfy the hunger of those who are spiritually hungry! May its pure, blue heaven never be darkened by the clouds of ill-feeling and strangeness! May it infurl the banner of Reconciliation and good-fellowship amongst the nations! May the glorious {{p4}} victories of its invisible army be ever successive! May the invisible hast of the Kingdom of Abha be its helper and assistant! May it be a brilliant light in the darkness of the world! The eyes of all the Bahais throughout the world are turning to America and are anxiously expecting to hear the glorious news of the Convention. The prayers of the believers ascend to heaven for itsunqualified success in every way. Although physically the Beloved will not be in your midst yet I have no doubt through your union of thought and action his spiritual presence will be felt. He prays-earnestly that the breaths of the Holy-Spirit may encircle the Convention!

{{p5}}

This morning the Beloved looking at the heavy snow-fall, remarked that as it will called on the mountains, within a few days it will melt and there will be the swelling of streams and rivers and the possibility of a flood in some parts. One may be able to stop this flood by human agencies and if not, the flood will subside by itself; but no power on the face of the earth {{p6}} will be able to stop the onrushing flood of the Cause of Baha-ullah. Its force is irresistible and its energy unconquerable. It will sweep away from before its path all the thorns and thistles of hatred and animosity planting the seeds of the flowers and hyacinths of affection. It brings in its wake life and not death; construction and not destruction progress and not ruin!

Today the Master did not go out. In his room he received the callers and with each he spoke in detail. One of the callers was an old, banned man who was extremely interested in Sociology. He told his ideas along these lines and the Beloved prayed that he may become confirmed to serve worthily the world of humanity.

{{p7}}

Mr. Paikert Alajos called bringing his photograph in Hungarian dress for the Master. He has been for three yrs the Austro-Hungarian Chargiod affairs in Washington, from 1900 to 1903 and is simply charmed with the Teachings and will do everything in his power to spread them in Budapest. He said: "I feel sure that the Bahai principles will be readily accepted by the Hungarian people and I will do all I can to stimulate this interest." The Master answered: I feel also quite assured of this, because such noble souls are found here such as yourself.

{{p8}}

Sardar and Mr. Moore arrived and each had an interview. Mr. Moore represents one of the largest mining machinery firm in the United States. When he told the Master about his work immediately he was interested and made him explain some of its intricate points. Mr. and Mrs. Stark came in with happy faces. They were very glad because the Hungarian and German papers of Budapest had very excellent reports of the Touranian meeting. I am sending you all these papers in a separate package. Although they are short yet they are written most sympathetically. They were so happy that I could not account for it; but realizing the cold indifference they had experienced in the past and {{p9}} this warm and glowing reception given to the Master by all classes. I could feel how they felt on this occasion. "Oh! We want to do everything for the Cause and the Master!" She warmly declared looking smilingly at her husband.

Later Prof Fipernowsky. A great pacifist of Hungary called and presented one of his addresses, delivered before the international law Congress. The Master spoke with him on peace and equality of sex.

And so it went on all day and part of the night; people {{p10}} of all class and races came to see the Beloved of the world. We were in his presence till late at night. He was extremely tired and his voice was a little hoarse. For the last two days  e has not been out and cancelled several engagements. What is interesting is to see so many professors, scholars, and thinkers coming to hear the Master's words and going away convinced that here was a Person, the like of whom could not be found anywhere.

Dear Harriet!

Tomorrow afternoon Our Beloved will leave for Vienna and thus bring to a close our very wonderful experience in the Capital of Hungary. Another chaper was added to the Western tour of the Master and a few more notes will bring it to a close.

The curtain over the stage of Hungary was raised, the divine dramatist entered, instructing and teaching the audience with his varied and unexampled art and now his engagement coming to an end, the curtain is slowly brought down. The spectators will have {{p2}} time to think over what they have heard and seen. Like the flushes of lightening, the importance of the words and action of the heavenly dramatist will be revealed to them as time rolls on and in God's appointed hour they shall arise to serve the Cause with heart and soul and duly appreciate the great flavors with which they were encircled. As soon as enough books and pamphlets are translated into the Hungarian language and the mass of the people become informed with the Bahai teachings there will be a general interest in what Our Beloved did during his stay in Budapest. He has scattered the seeds in the ground of the hearts and with proper irrigation, there will be a great blossoming forth of the flowers. 

{{p3}}

Today the weather was spring-like. Now and then the sun shone forth from behind the clouds, melting mountains of snow which have been gathered in the streets and on the top of the hills. The Master felt much better and his voice quite clear, loosing its yesterday's huskiness. After drinking tea in his Presence, he related certain interesting episodes of the life of Baha-ullah. It seems to me few will be capable to write a complete history of Baha-ullah like Abdul Baha. Its general outline is already Known to us but these {{p4}} fascinating rich details must be written and preserved for humanity and no one knows these like the Master. Now and then he relates to us one of these anecdotes but he has not the time to write them. Once I asked him to dictate to me a few pages each day but he did not yield to my request. Who will write the life-drama of Baha-ullah! Who will essay this sublime, superhuman theme?

About 9'oclock a carriage was ordered and the Beloved following by me called on Mr. and Mrs. Stark "Nyul Utea5. On the way I received two or three slaps on my cheeks and become mentally richer by the recital of two more stories of a Baktashi in Acca. Arriving at Mr. Stark's home he received the Master with outstretched arms and joyful heart. His little son {{p5}} was there to attract the attention of the Master and receive his divine caress and kisses. After a minutes Mrs. Atock came into the large reception room and expressed her happiness that the Master at last blessed her home. She brought in her cook, her maid and the governess of the children that the Master may also bless them. He shook hands with each and gone them a few words of benediction! Sitting on a chair he addressed Mr. and Mrs. Stark. This is a blessed home and will be a very important center in the future. From this home, the lights of Guidance have shone forth. From this home the call of the Kingdom {{p6}} of Abha has been raised. This is the first home in Hungary in which the name of Baha-ullah was mentioned. May it become always a center of guidance! May many Bahai meetings be held here! May the Teachings of the Blessed Perfections be diffused to all parts of Hungary from this home! I have come and sown the seeds. Now you must arise and water them. This is your duty. Be you confident that Baha-ullah shall assist you. He will inspire your hearts you two are the first man and women to up rise the banner of Bahai Cause in Hungary, your station is very great in the Kingdom of Abha! This is not Known at present. In the future people {{p7}} will come from all parts to visit this home, because this is the first home from which the Glad-tiding of the appearance of the Kingdom of Abha was issued. Years ago why was travellings toward Tiberias, I saw a large number of people gathered in one place. I asked one why these people have congregated there?" He said: It is a matter of tradition that once was a time, one of the apostles sat on one of these racks. Now these pilgrims came from all parts of the world and kiss all the rocks perchance they may Kiss the right one.

{{p8}}

More praise be to God that you are the objects of the Favor of Baha-ullah. Mr. Stark took us to the palatial residence of Mrs. Toupernawsky. This home was built 200 years ago and at the end of the reception room, there was a flower garden with a fountain in which red and golden fish disport. Mrs. Topernowsky, her daughter, her son-in-law and her three grandchildren greeted the Master. The three little girls were from ten to three dressed in white and very pretty. When they came in the {{p9}} room they looked like three angels. They gathered around the Master with much love and affection and he spoke to his two hostesses on the importance of the spiritual of ife and the poverty of the physical life. In orer to illustrate this, he told a story about Alexander the Great during his Eastern expectation. At the time of departure he said Madame Toupernowsky. Endeavor that the light of God {{p10}} may ever shine from thy home. This is my advice to thee. From there we drove to the house of Prof. Goldziher. I have come to say farewell to thee the Master told him when he was greeting the Prof. A long discussion on the early history of the Bah, and the prophecies given by the Bah about the carried on in eloquent Arabic. The Master spoke with earnestness and fire. We went to the hotel and Mr. Stark was minded to eat with us.

After lunch he was asked to stay and have tea. When the Master arose from {{p11}} his nap we gathered in his room and Mr. Stark asked about the Society of the East. The answer was in detail, showing that the present unrest of the people push them to expect the dawn of hope. He also spoke on three kind of freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of speech and freedom of action.

{{p12}}

In the evening Mr. Moore came and he invited us to dinner, being the last night, we are spending in Budapest. We write a postal card to Doctor Moody Teheran and all of us signed it.

I have to hurry because I am called to go and translate. Many people have come to see Abdul Baha tonight to say goodbye!



###Grand Hotel, Wien I. Karntnerring G. April 18th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Now from Vienna from the Breeze of God is blowing to all parts of the world. We felt Budapest at 2 pm and arrived in Vienna at 6:30. Persian was at the station and in two automobiles we were driven fust to hotel Beatrix about 15 minutes distance. A room No. 4 I was designated for the Master and rooms for us next to it. But the hotel was neither in a good locality nor what it ought to be, so the Master decided to move to tomorrow morning.

{{p2}} 

As Abdul Baha was invited to dinner we took ours in the hotel and with Mr. Herrigel, in the rain I went out to find the right kind of quarters so that in the morning we may not have to look around. After looking over six hotels we selected satisfied, because we had accomplished our task. On our arrival in the Beatris the manager told us that the Persians had already left for the Grand Hotel. We took the car and came to Grand Hotel and found our friends well situated. The number of the Master's room is 22. This hotel is the largest and the best in Vienna; it is something like Plaza in New York. I have had no time to go down stair and see the dining room but {{p3}} they tell me the five o'clock tea of Grand Hotel is famous; the royalty and the society folks of Vienna gather here. The trip from Budapest to Vienna was uneventful. As we were in the second class and the Master with Sayad Ahmad Bageroff the first class and the trip was a short one I did not call on him. On the way I saw the mountain covered with snow and here and there green grass! It was a cloudy day but now and then the sun shone forth for a few minutes. On our arrival in Veinna it rained a good symbol of the rain of the Knowledge of the Kingdom {{p4}} which will pour upon the sail of the hearts.

In the morning after drinking tea with the Master as he was looking at the Great Palace of the Emperor of Austria-Hungary on the opposite side of Danube he said: I would have liked to see this place. As say it is built recently. I desired to see what innovations they have introduced in but we did not find any time. However it is not important. There is a verse in the Khoran in which it is said: As you walk in the Desert, you may see a piece of crumbled wall here and a forsaken well there; both of which may have been in the past years, centers of great cities and civilization.

At eight o'clock the Master through insistent entreaty of Mr. Nadler {{p5}} Robert called at his Studio to give him the last sitting so that he may finish his painting. His addresses Nadler Robert Andrassy - UT 7.1. Budapest. He has certainly painted a wonderful portrait of the Beloved and it will be a great heritage and memorial to the city for future time. Returning we found many people waiting to see him. Our Indian Sirdan was taken into the Presence. The Beloved exhorted him to work for the glory and honor of India, that although many of the Rajohs and Novvales have been the cause of the decline of their native land, may he be the means of her rise. He can do this through the Favor and Bounty of Baha-ullah. As an example to this. The grandees and Ministers {{p6}} of Persia have in the past and in the present degraded the prestige and influence of their country, while the Bahais through the assistance and aid of the Blessed Perfection of Persia. Ere long than shalt see that Persia has become very beloved in the Eyes of the whole world. 

Dr. Hagara Victor with his wife and daughter come in. Doctor Victor is a most spiritual, cultured Hungarian. He speaks English most fluently, likewise his daughter and wife. His daughter is the woman who translated the Master's address from English into Hungarian at the meeting of the Star of the East. She is a most intelligent earnest learned, lovely woman. The Master liked her {{p7}} translation and praised her for it. "You have brought to us light." She said today to the Beloved and in these few words she not only showed the mission of the Master but her spiritual perception and capacity. She is a writer of exceptional ability and she is going to write a series of articles on the cause for the Hungarian Press so that the Public may Know the Bahai teachings. She desired to have the literature and books so that she may fully acquaint herself. The Master praised all the three very much and expressed the hope that they will do their lust to spread these Teachings.

Mr. Moore requested the {{p8}} Beloved to chant in his gramophone a prayer for the people of Budapest. The Master accepted it and Mr. Moore brought his machine into his room. He chanted through the tube a wonderful prayer, leaving another eternal heritage for Budapest. The prayer was in Arabic and as he was chanting I was standing behind him writing it. It is as follows: "O God! O God! I supplicate towards Thee with a heart overflowing with Thy Love. I call on Thee, O Lord in the middle of nights: O God! save me through Thy Grace and Bounty! Suffer me to speak thy praises amongst Thy creatures! O God! O God! These are Thy Servants who have turned their faces toward the direction of Thy Providence.

{{p9}} 

They are attracted to Thy voice. They believe in Thy Singleness! O Lord! Make them the signs of Thy Mercy amongst They children and the tokens of Thy Bestowal amongst Thy servants! O Lord! O Lord! Descend upon them Thy blessing. Illumine their heart by the lights of Thy Knowledge. Dilate their breasts by the Verses of Thy Glory and Sanctity! Make them brilliant lamps shining with the light of Thy Love. Verily Thou art the Merciful and the clement! 

O Lord! O! Lord! This is a city in which are gathered the {{p10}} wise ones from amongst Thy Servants and the mighty ones of the countries. Guide them always in the Straight Path. Enlighten their eyes by beholding Thy Manifest Light. Suffer them to become the servants of the oneness of the world of humanity; unfurling the banner of the Most Great Guidance betwist the heaven and earth, serving with all their might in the cause of Peace and Salvation and wishing that humankind may attain to the summit of Everlasting Glory! Verily Thou art the clement! Verily Thou art the Compassionate! and Verily Thou art the {{p11}} Powerful and the Glorious!"

Mr. Moore took a few photo of the Master in his room and of the Master in his room and of his bed.

Many people arrived, especially Mr. Stark. I evenanticipate receive good news from you he said to Mr. Stark. I will write to you and hope the the Cause will advance greatly. At one o'clock carriages were ready and the Master took Mr. Stark with him. On the way to the station he spoke to him about the future <12> of the Cause in Budapest. At the station Mrs. Strak with a bouquet of flowers greeted him. Our Sardar, Mr. Nadler, Mr. and Mrs. Vicar, the Consul General of Turkeya and more than 20 more friends were there to say farewell to the Beloved. He expressed his gratefulness to those present and at 2 o'clock the train pulled out of the station. A photo was taken by Mr. Moore as he looked out of the window of the train. Many hands and handkerchiefs were waving in the air many eyes were wet with tears. After a minutes the chapter of Budapest was closed, the curtain fell down and we were travelling towards a new fields of labor.



### Grand Hotel, Wien I. Karntnerring G. April 19,1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Since our departure from Paris I have not received any news from America. I am eager to receive the news and the Master too, because he  
asked me the other day in Budapest, whether Ihave received any letters from America.

{{p2}}

As the Master was invited last night to dinner by one of the Persian friends in Vienna, he slept there and came to the hotel early morning. The  
present Turkish Ambassador is an old friend of the Master so he asked me to go and call and inform him of his Presence in Vienna. Having heard that the Master is in Budapest he had written to the Consul General of that city to let him know when arrives in Vienna. The Turkish Embassy is at IV Prinz Eugenstrasse 34, five minutes’ walk from our hotel. When I called I was informed that the Ambassador was as set sleep so I left a card, with my message on it.

{{p3}}

When I returned at the hotel the Master told us of a meeting in which the present Ambassador with a few other Turkish offices were present in Acca.When I entered the meeting the Beloved continued.I observed they were all looking askance at me.Thy just salaamed and started to speak amongst themselves as though I was a stranger and introducer. Then one of them asked the governor of Acca about the theory of a writer in regard to Trinity just published in a book. The Governor not Knowing what to say waved the question aside. I realize the questioner's aim was for me to answered and not the governor.

{{p4}}

I spoke at length on the significance of Trinity; the Manifestation of God, the holy-spirit the  Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Next day sunrise I was awakened from my sleep that the present Ambassador and his friends were down stair and desire to see me..... He was one of the wisest men of Turkey. He had been twice the Grand Vizir and he had carried out all the missions entrusted to him successfully. He was a diplomat of the first rank learned and intelligent. In those days it was rumored that his political procurements were given serious attention by the Cabinets of European Powers. Once he was appointed as the Governor of yaman. Thinking that the inhabitants were very {{p5}} fanatical he wore a big turban and ordered all jis staff to do the same so that he may be able to assuage their anger against any innovation. 

After a while Mr. Cordes and the Secretary of the Theosophical Society with a few others came to welcome the Master to Vienna. Mr. Cordes said,the first time he heard about the Bahai Cause and was immediately attracted to it was two yrs ago in Adyar India- the headquarters of the Theosophical. He heard a lecture given by a Bahai traveller. This lecturer stood just in the same spot where Mrs. Besant stood every time she delivered can address and as the result of this many people {{p6}} became interested in the Bahai Movement. This instance again showed us how the wonderful Cause of Baha-ullah was being permeable everywhere. There were some hidden, invisible forces that were constantly working to spread the Teachings but could not be seen by the outward eyes.

In welcoming them the Master said: I have not come to see Vienna as many tourists do but I have come to see you. I am longing always to see perfect souls. Wherever I see noble men and women I am made happy, even if it is in prison. I hope that as a result of my trip to Vienna, the light of guidance may shine, the eyes may receive a new sight, the hearts be gladdened and the spirits rejoiced. For the realization of this object I have {{p7}} come to Vienna. The quotation of nationality and language was touched. The Beloved said: The Persians, the Austrians, the Germans, the French, the Italian and the English people belong to one common stock of Aryan race.  
originally this sturdy race lived along the river of Ganges in India. This people grew rapidly in number and plate strength. Having become too numerous they migrated to the platen of Iran - (Persia). From the tableland of Iran, a second migration was set in motion toward Caucasus. After many ages of expansion, the third migration started westward. Then a stream of migration {{p8}} at various periods flowed toward Europe, each  one, inhabiting a portion of the land. Lack of intercourse and communication created differences of language and customs. Little by little they were more and more stringed from each other. Now my hope is this: Just as originally these various nations belonged to one family; may they again return to their primal unity. Formerly they were one as regards to their physical life; may they become united in this age as regard to their spiritual life; After this the Master went out to walk in the city Park not far away. This is flower day in Vienna and all the young girls have little imitations a basket of flowers {{p9}} in their hands with small deposit boxes selling flowers for charity. As the Master was walking, many came to him and instead of dropping small coins in the box he would drop one or two Kormas. There were literally thousands of people in the street and Park and everybody stopped to look at the Master, wondering who was this strange man! I have seldom seen anywhere people standing still and looking so intently at him. Thousands of eyes were upon him. This brought to my mind the story he told us about Baha ullah; that his person was so majestic and so glorious that as he walked in the streets of Bagdad all eyes were upon turned to him.

{{p10}} 

When in the Park a little girl run to him to sell the flowers. He got hold of her and Kissed her and filled her packed with many Korunas. Her mother who was watching this scene came to her and asked to kiss the hand of "Monsieur" become he was so lovely to you." Very courtesy she bowed and Kissed the hands, the blessed hands.

It surprised me very much was to see young girls working as brick and had-carriers on the buildings. Our their heads they carried heavy loads of bricks and mud. This was most astonishing and explained to my unaccustomed eyes the sad story of social indifference. To gain a livelihood by the fair sex must be extremely hard {{p11}} otherwise these young girls and old women would not have to become stone-carriers. The Master on his return about noon took with himself Sayad Ahmad Bogerrof and called on the Turkish Ambassador. He was kept for lunch and it was about 3 o'clock that he returned extremely fatigued by speaking. At four Mr. Alexander Engelhardt called on the Master and made a model clay of his face. This morning he met the Master down stair and being attracted by his extraordinary countenance, pleaded him to <12> come and make of model. He lives most of the time in this hotel and makes statuettes of important personages. For twenty minutes he worked and out of the soft clay he brought out the wonderful face of the Beloved. He will have another sitting. As the day was full of sunshine the Master with all the Persians took another walk through the public Park. Again he was stopped by the girls and dropped many a Kromas in their boxes. Having returned he rested for a few minutes and {{p13}} then Mr. Cordes came to take him to the home of Prof Thern, Kastlergasse II where the Theosophists will be gathered to hear him speak. It took us little time to be there. Mrs. Thern conducted the Master to a private room. At half past seven the meeting opened and he came in and everyone got up from their seat. There were about one hundred people present. The Theosophical Society has just been formed in the mouth of October and is therefore quite young. There were many young people {{p14}} and they greeted him with enthusiasm and warm feeling. The English address was translated into German by Mr. Cordes. His theme was the dogmas which exist in the present day religious the freedom of the Theosophists from such superstitious and the preserve of there realities in Man. After the meeting he Shook hand with all the people and returned to the other room. Here many were presented for private interviews and each person receive new hope and new courage. They were all attracted to the Cause and were glad to receive the {{p15}} light from the source and not from in a second hand way. There we met a Persian girl who was studying in Vienna. I was surprised to hear her speak in Persian in the first time but was glad to find one from my native land. After the meeting the Master was driven in a carriage to the house of the "Persian" friend to take his supper. We were also invited. Many delicious Persian dishes were served. This hotel is so big that our rooms were quite far from the elevated, so we have again moved to another <16> part on the same floor. We have an excellent suite of three connecting rooms No. 46,47,48. The Master is living in front room No. 46 overlooking the broad avenue. We are pleased with our place now and don't think there will be another change. Now that the Master was here, the Cause will be spread along spiritual lives; there will be no mistakes and a good foundation will be laid for the future.


### Grand Hotel, Wien I. Karntnerring G. April 20th 1913

{{p1}}

My Dear Harriet!

This morning I received a few letters from America. The Master was pleased to hear good news from the believes. The greater the progress of the Cause and its promotion of the Teachings, the more his happiness. He is now invading new fields and new countries. He is teaching us how to introduce the Cause to a public {{p2}} who has not yet heard the name of Baha-ullah. Uniformly every one who has had this privilege of presenting himself before the Master has left him, unimpressed with his spiritual personality and divine Teachings. His example of unselfishness and heavenly character has made thousands of people live better lives and inspired with holier purposes. His is the authority of the spirit the simplicity of truth and the sublimity of ideals. He has filled the world with light and beauty, love and peace. The greatest honor for us is to follow his example, spread his words, upraise his standard, cry out in his name, diffuse the Fragrances of his flowers and summon the people to his principles.

{{p3}}

This morning the Beloved sent several telegrams to various cities of the orient giving the news of his safe arrival in Vienna. After drinking tea he said to Mr. Herrigel: The City of when will become a center for the Cause of God; Only after my departure the friends must not remain inactive. They must work with greater zeal and enthusiasm. They must not say; now that Abdul Baha is gone let us take a rest first, and then work. There is no such a thing as rest in the Bahai Cause in its present stage. Ceaseless activity continuous teaching must be our watchword. Every Bahai must become a trumpet {{p4}} of the Cause. All the ears must become filled with its voice. What is the use of a voiceless trumpet? A Bahai must be like a sweet-fragrant rose, diffusing to perfume all around. This period must be dedicated to the promotion of the principles of Baha-ullah! you must be exceedingly kind to the Theosophists. When you meet them tell them that they are freed from blind dogmas. that they are investigating the Reality that they are very near to the Bahai Cause. From time to time, the believers of Stuttgart must come to Wien and give addresses on the Revelation. Last night I observed spiritual motion and ecstasy in the Theosophical Society. They were very alive.

{{p5}}

Mr. Herrigel said that he has translated Our Beloved's address in the Jewish Synagogues of San-Francisco into German and expects to read it at a public meeting. The Master said: See to it that it is also published in a German newspaper and later in a pamphlet. This address is very useful for the Christians, because some of the Ministers have secretary spread the rumor that the Bahais are the enemies of Christ. Now they will see that in a Jewish Signage; we have established the validity of Jesus Christ that we are lovers of Christ. If today the male took hold of a thousand average ministers {{p6}} of the Gospel and brought them in the public square and address them; you must either deny Christ or you will killed. I wonder how many of them will remain friend! When Napoleon wanted to marry again, he applied to the Pope for permission. The pope said it is impossible! Then Napoleon put him in prison. Not being able to stand the ignoring of prison, he gone the permission. But, it on the other hand, if they took us to the public square and with the sword of executioner commanded us to state that Christ was only the prophet of God and then be free we will cry out; Verily, Christ was the word of God and the spirit of God and we will {{p7}} most joyfully give up our lives for Christ.

Sapahdar Agam who also has been travelling in these parts sieve his departure from Paris came to call on the Beloved. In the course of conversion with him the Master said: After the ascent of Baha-ullah I was all done. Enemies within and enemies without had attacked me and thousand difficulties surrounded me. But my confidence and trust was within, because deriving the days of this life be explicitly promised me that he will assist me always. I heard this promise from his oven lips, therefore {{p8}} I knew that under all circumstances I will be confirmed and all my enemies will be defeated. Then he told him of a wonderful dream he had right after the departure of Baha-ullah.

Being a fine fay he called me to have a walk with him. It was Sunday and the people were out going to their churches. He walked toward a church, about three blocks from the hotel. Its outside looked like a palace and its dome rose up to the sky. The Beloved entered the Church. All the eyes of the worshippers were upon him. The inside roof contained wonderful paintings, the columns were of marble the decoration was magnificent and rich. It was a catholic church, and before the statue {{p9}} of every Saint in the different corners of the Temple candles were lighted and many souls were Kneeling. The Master walked around for ten minutes looking intently upon the Statue of the Crucified Christ and the Saints. Coming out he dropped several Kronnas in the box near the gate. These people may have thought he said musingly that we are there ridicule. God forbid! They do not Know, how the pictures and statues Christ affect me. It was better to come out, because I might have prevented them from their worship on account of my strange appearance.

Arriving at the hotel {{p10}} we found many Theosophists waiting to see him. He greeted them with heartfelt cordiality and spoke about the meeting last night: I was most pleased to present myself in your midst and speak with you; a meeting which believes in the spiritual power, a power which is supernatural and super-intellectual. Therefore I hope that this Theosophical Society may helped and its members gain victory over the pillars of the world of nature who are the materialists of this age. It is evident that today the material philosophers have overcome the religionists. The influence exerted by nature and its admirers is by far greater than the influence wielded by religion and its devotees. Because {{p11}} all the religious are submerged in the sea of dogmas and sacerdotal ritualism of course the followers of nature overcome the worshippers of superstitious. But these who are truly spiritual and immersed in the sea of God's spiritual Graces, they overcome all things. Consequently I trust that the darkness of this city may be dispelled through the appearance of the lights of the spirit. Strive! make ye an effort! and work by day and by night so that a time may soon come when the continent of Europe is illumined. At present it is  very dark and one cannot walk {{p12}} surely and steadfastly. One of those present said: "We hope to do this service through your assistance and the power of the Holy Spirit." 

It is very true the Master said; Because the limited human powers are unable to render such a great universal service. The power of the Holy Spirit causes the appearance of reality and as the reality is one, all of us will become one." Someone asked that he has read in the literature of the Bahais that they believe Baha-ollah is the Father. What did you mean by this? By the Master said: Father we mean the Educator. Just as the Father is tender to his children, likewise, the instructor teaches them. The function of the Father and the Educator is material life, the Educator {{p13}} gives the mental and the spiritual life. Therefore when we say Baha-ullah is the Father, we mean he is an Educator - a spiritual Educator - or in other word, he is the Manifestat ion of divine attributes. Moreover as one of the perfect qualities of the Divinity is Fatherhand, therefore we give him the little of the Father; because the Manifestation of God is like unto a clear mirror in which is reflected the rays of the Sun of Reality and one of these rays is Fatherhand. Generally, there is the teacher of the children in the Educational Institutions, from {{p14}} Kindergarten school to the university. They are all teachers in various degrees. Secondly. In philosophy a teacher means a person who has studied all the sciences and arts, has became well-established in all the branches of human endeavors and is unique and peerless in his age. According to oriental history there has been in the past two such Master in philosophy. The first one was Aristotle who was well-versed in all the sciences and accomplishments of his time. The Second one was Farabi who announced that he was the second teacher. The King ordered the organization of an Academy of learned men and Farabi was examined by the master of every branch of Knowledge. Not only he demonstrated {{p15}} that he Knows as much as they Know but he established his superiority over them. Even he was examined in the art of music and he displayed his marvelous versatility and many-sidedness. The academy unanimously voted to give him the most covetous title of the Master. Avicena also in his time claimed to be the third teacher. Consequently an Academy of the thinkers of the age was formed. At the time of examination he showed his almost miraculous knowledge in every branch and easily established his superiority over all the rest. When the hour for the {{p16}} musical examination come around he was found that his Knowledge of music is only equal and not superior to the musical art his age. After much consultation they did not concerned upon him the title of "Master", because in one of the branches of Arts he had an equal, therefore they give him the little of Raiis (chief). Thirdly, according to spiritual terminology which is our way of expression a "teacher" is the Center of the divine lights, so we say Christ was a Teacher of men. By the word "teacher" we mean, the perfect source of universal virtues in the world of humanity.

{{p17}}

Someone asked: "I have been told that the objects of the Bahai Movement and the Theosophical  Society are one and the same. If so, why there should be two names, two distinct organizations, two made of expression?" The Master: Well said, you have brought up a good paint. According to our faith whosoever investigates independently the reality, he is a Bahai although he may not Know this himself. We do not desire to add another name or word to the already many names. Our aim is to spread the Knowledge of reality, and diffuse the fragrance of the rose. Because there are two or many roses {{p18}} of the same color and perfume, can we say that one of them is not necessary? Let us have all the sweet roses we can get. We can never have enough roses. Can we? Besides this the Bahai Movement is not an organization. It is the fresh Breeze of the Garden of God. You can never organize the Bahai Cause. It cannot be located in one single place or centered in one individual. The Bahai Movement is the spirit of this age. It is everywhere. It has no geographical limits. It is the essence of all the highest ideals of this century. A person may claim to be a Bahai or may be Known as a Bahai for all his life and may not Know at {{p19}} all what a Bahai means. Another person may never have heard the name of Bahai and may at the same time practice all the attributes which are necessary to make one a Bahai. That is why his holiness Christ says, those who are not against us are with us. You must Know the tree by its fruits. Now to answer your question from another standpoint. Everyone Knows that in a seed, their lay enveloped, the young plant, the root, the tree, the branches the blossoms and the fruits. This simple Knowledge is however not sufficient. There must need a {{p20}} gardener to plant the seed in a pure ground to water it to take care of it till it reaches to the stages of fruition. There must need the power of the Holy Spirit to put into practice the divine principles. All that his holiness Baha-ullah has written are today practiced by the Bahais. More than 20.00 people have sacrifice their lives. One of the principles of Baha-ullah is universal Peace amongst the religious. In the Orient, the religious were inimical toward each other; now through this power they are united. In the world of existence every understanding is dependent {{p21}} upon the realization of three things. First Knowledge. 2nd Decision. 3rd Executive power. For example in building this hotel, First the plan was drawn.2nd the company approved and decided upon the plan, 3rd the Capitalists put their money together to build it. Again the Bahai Cause is an all-inclusive Movement, the teachings of all the religions and societies are foun here. The Christians, the Buddhists the Zoroostrians, the Theosophists the Freemasons, the Spiritualists {{p22}} etc etc do found their highest aims in this Cause, while this cannot be applied to other religious, sects and societies. Even the Socialists and philosophers find their theories fully developed in this movement the Master spoke at length about a famine in Persia where the rich Bahais gave up willingly all their possessions so that the members of the Community may be protected. The question of Moukhoad and celibacy was touched; and the Beloved dwelt upon this Subject, giving instances as to low an unproductive life, such as the one led in most of the {{p23}} Monasteries and covenants is not commendable; that we must be useful members of the human Society, that we must serve our fellowmen in a practical way. He told them of the mummery and convent in Mount Carmel, of a big Monastery in Russia with more than 5000 monks. The lives of these people are spent in prayers and worship while God has created them to work for the betterment of humanity.

In the afternoon the Master called on Lapabdor in Hotel Imperial but he was not there. His Secretary {{p24}} entertained the Beloved when you return to Persia Abdul Baha told him. Give my greeting to the green Mountains and rolling valleys, to the singing nightingales and the cooling springs, to the fragrant rose-gardens and the fresh breeze of Persia. I love them all. Remember me to them.

Returning to the hotel and drinking his tea he called on the Persian Minister. The subject of his discussion was America and his trip through that vast land.

Not resting for one moment, on his return he told me {{p25}} to have some of the Newspapers ready such as Asiatic Quarterly Review. Christian Commonwealth, waking Mirror. Palo Altan etc and we called on the Turkish Ambassador. For one hour the Beloved talked on the principles of the Cause and his Western trip for the last 2 yrs and half and leaving the newspapers with the Ambassador he was taken to the house of the 'Persian" friend for supper. It was about midnight when the Beloved returned to the hotel to rest for a few {{p26}} hours before the down of another long day.



### Grand Hotel, Wien I.Karntnerring. April 21st 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

At last I received your two good letters of March 29th and April 4th. I also received other letters from the friends, giving news of the progress of the Cause. The Master was more than pleased over the harmonious condition of the Cause in New York. He was glad that like unto the disciplined soldiers, they were engaged in the spread and promotion of the Teachings. If the believers could faintly realize how happy the Beloved was made when he heard they were united and active {{p2}} they would always work for unity and agreement. The friends are the waves of one sea, the stars of one heaven, the pearls of one ocean, the jewels of one mine, the fruits of one tree, the rays of one sun, the flowers of one garden and the rains of one cloud.

Packages of letters were also received from the Oriental assemblies, each bringing the good news of the progress of the Cause. The Master spent two hours in looking over his mail and then going out for half an hour to call on a friend, he returned with the Persian Minister and three {{p3}} other Persians. He was speaking to them about Persia's condition and the non-interference of the Bahais in political matters when Mrs. Marie Thaller was announced. She was a very enthusiastic and happy woman and tremendously attracted to the Cause; bubbling over the results of His talk. Since hearing him, she has been the happiest woman in the world. She could not sleep last night at all thinking of his spiritual power and his nearness to her. She was really full of life. The Master {{p4}} showed her the photograph of Mrs. Stark. He told her: I like you to become as perfect as this woman. She is a flame of fire. She is very spiritual, very pure and overflowing with aesthetic susceptibilities. For the benefit of the Persian Minister and a few other friends he gave a review of his address before the Open Forum in San Francisco and put them in good humour when the story of the Cause and the materialists was recited.

Two automobiles carried him and the friends to the Schonbrunn palace, the summer {{p5}} residence of Emperor. While the automobile was driving through the avenue and the streets of Vienna, I told the Master the news just received from America. He spoke for the benefit of other Persians about Mrs. Fruf and while he was talking about her courage and firmness and enthusiasm he was laughing and in good humour. For more than one hour we walked through {{p6}} the Schonbrunn, passing by the cages of the bears and many wild animals. The Master said: If one of these bears got hold of Mirza Ahmad Solnab in the mountains of Alaska, what would he do with him? Will he give the bear a Bahai love-hug? One of the most novel sights to be seen was the peculiar arrangement of the trees, so that if one stopped in the beginning of the avenue, he would see a high wall, straight as an arrow, green and verdant! The Park was very large and the flower beds arranged most artistically. You can easily imagine what will be {{p7}} the Park of an Emperor! About 2 o'clock we returned to the hotel. The Master eating his lunch, rested for awhile. In the afternoon we enjoyed a quiet rest and at five three callers arrived.

Fran Professor Thern in whose house we had our first meeting, brought her book so that the Master may write something in it and he wrote the following prayer: O Thou Almighty! Make this Theosophical Society {{p8}} a rose-garden and a meadow through the downpour of the rain of Thy Providence; so that they may become delivered from expectation, behold the rays of the Sun of Reality, become informed with the existence of the invisible world and attain to the Mystery of Mysteries. Verily Thou Art the Guide! (Sig) Abdul Baha Abbas.

At seven Mr. Eder, the President of Psychological Society and the Vice President of Theosophical Society came to take the Master to the Lodge in Johannesgasse 2 IV at Mr. Paul Luckeneder. {{p9}} As it was quite near we walked and the avenues packed with moving, pushing humanity, gazed wonderingly at the Beloved. Many people stopped and looked at him long. Arriving at the place we found it to be newly built apartment house and no elevator; The Theosophical Lodge being on the fourth floor. With great difficulty the Master ascended the stairs. There were more people present than the other night, nearly two hundred, all anxious to hear {{p10}} him speak. After a few minutes rest he came out and sitting on a chair designated for him, delivered a wonderful address on the influence of the spirit and the transference of the single indivisible atom throughout all the degrees of the Kingdoms. The audience listened with rapt attention and when he finished they were so attracted that they clamoured for another lecture to be delivered on Wednesday night. The Beloved accepted their plea {{p11}} and brought the meeting to a close by delivering a beautiful prayer. Then he retired to another room and spoke with many of the friends individually. When he left the house he said to Mrs. Luckeneder: I was most pleasured with this meeting because it was a nest of the heavenly birds. He took his supper tonight in the hotel. His voice is yet a little hoarse.

In his address on the Spirit he said: The glory of the world of humanity is not {{p12}} through the body. This is the honor of the animal world; but the Glory of man came through the spirit. Spirit quickens and regenerates humankind and not the body. Spirit draws man near into God and not the body. Spirit is the discoverer of the realities of phenomena and not the body. Spirit establishes love and amity amongst the human race and not the body. Spirit will usher in the era of Peace and Salvation and not the body. Spirit attract the hearts together and not the body. Spirit {{p13}} has drawn me to Vienna so that I may associate with you and not the body. I am an Easterner and you are from the West. It is the power of the Spirit that has gathered us together. It is the Spirit that gives wings to man so that he may soar in the immensity of God's Kingdom. Spirit is the Collective Center of all the perfections. Take away the spirit from man and he is an animal!

I will end this letter with the Master's supplication. "O Thou Kind God! The members of this society have {{p14}} turned their faces toward Thee. They are begging to receive the lights from Thy Most Great Guidance. They enjoy spiritual susceptibilities. O God! Quicken the spirits! Extend the horizon of their thoughts. Bestow upon them the Power of the Kingdom! Confer upon them the Confirmations of the Holy-Spirit! O God! Endear these souls and give unto them merciful powers, so that they may illumine this country with Thy Light! May they resuscitate these dead bodies! May they cause the disappearance of the {{p15}} darkness of nature through the rays of Thy Sun! O God! Assist these souls and deliver them from the darkness of nature. Clothe them with the heavenly body and surround them with spiritual Forces. Verily Thou art the Generous and the Mighty!



### Grand Hotel, Wien I.Karntnerring. April 22nd 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

One of the most precious souvenirs of our sojourn in Vienna is the delightful little bust made of the Master by Mr. Alexander Engelehardt, the artist. Unconsciously, he has eternalized his name in the Bahai history. He is a young man with a fine face, keen eyes, ample hairs and altogether a very nice fellow. The clay model was finished in two sittings, each sitting taking from twenty to thirty minutes. He is a native of Dresden and his father is the Editor of an influential paper in that city. You may call him a travelling artist. He has made {{p2}} busts of King Edward and other famous men. From the clay model, a few busts are being made in imitation bronze and they will be ready in a week. The price which he charges will be a nominal one. I think it will be three dollars. I have ordered two for myself - myself in the sense of sending one to you and the other to Washington - and if the friends desire to have any, they can put their order together and I will see that they will get them in time. I believe it is one of the best heritages to posterity. How these matters concern one after another quite miraculously when you look upon each incident from an isolated point of view.

{{p3}}

This morning a reporter from "Die Feit" called on the Beloved and asked many questions and received satisfying answers. As the Master has spoken in this city only to the Theosophists, the reporter asked whether he is the leader of this Society.

A.B.: We are Bahais but on certain questions we find ourselves in agreement with the Theosophists.

Reporter: In which part of the world this Cause is more spread?

A.B.: In Persia, although there are many of them in America.

Reporter: Is this a Mohamadan sect?

A.B.: This movement is neither a sect nor an Islamic denomination. It is the religion of love and brotherhood toward all humanity.

{{p4}} 

Reporter: I have read the principles of your movement and find everything in it reasonable.

A.B.: In these parts no one as yet is completely informed of the Bahai Cause. If a person learns all the teachings of Baha-wllah he will acknowledge that they are the spirit of this age, the light of this country.

Reporter: Are there Bahais all over the world?

A.B.: Yes.

Reporter: Where do you come from?

A.B.: I came now from Budapest. I have been in America where I have travelled through many large cities and spoke in many churches. After nearly 8 months, returning from California to New York I sailed for Liverpool. {{p5}} The London, Bristol, Edinburgh, Paris, Stuttgart, Margentheim, Budapest and now in your delightful city.

Reporter: You are wonderful to travel so much at this age!

A.B.: The power of God assists me.

Reporter: How long are you going to stay here?

A.B.: I will leave for Paris in a day or two.

Reporter: Do you find many people are interested in your Cause.

A.B.: Now it is the beginning of this movement in Europe but it will be soon spread to all parts.

Reporter: How long have you been travelling for the propagation of your principles?

A.B.: It is now 2 years and half.

{{p6}} 

Reporter: Will you tell me something about your teachings? Then the Master told him how previous to the coming of Baha-wllah, darkness and ignorance prevailed amongst all the religions and nations of the East, how Baha-wllah like unto a glorious sun appeared and established certain teachings. Then he enumerates this principles, 1st Investigation of Reality. 2, the oneness of the world of humanity, 3rd Religion must be the Cause of love and amity. 4th Religion must be in accord with science and reason. 5th Universal Peace. 6th Economic plan. 7th Equality of man and woman etc. Then he gave him an exposition {{p7}} of natural and divine civilization. The reporter asked a question about the American people. The Master answered: They are very progressive and well-established in modern civilization. They are the investigators of Reality and thirsty for every salubrious water. They have a vast and unlimited continent, capable of undreamed of development. They are ever pushing forward. One must move and push and be alert and active in America, otherwise it is not his place. The reporter smiled and said: "How well you understand them?" Then there was more talk about the exile and imprisonment of Baha-wllah, the limitation {{p8}} of material civilization. The reporter left the Presence of the Beloved impressed not only with the Teachings but with his wonderful personality.

Many friends came to see him. They were all gathered around him. One woman asked "how should we join eternal happiness?" Answer: you must enter in the Kingdom of Abha. In the Kingdom of Abha, there is light upon light. The darkness of sorrow and pain is banished forever from that region. His Holiness Baha-wllah today has opened the Doors of the Kingdom and people are receiving vision of that far-off palace {{p9}} of happiness. They are made so happy that they sing and dance under the sword. Eternal happiness is all-inclusive. In it is unbraced material happiness. This world is like unto ant-houses. Have you ever observed how the ants are ever busy to gather provisions, sometimes carrying heavier loads than themselves? But once in a while some of these ants grow wings and soar away. I hope you will be like them.

A few of the Persians called. There are I think about 20 Persians in Vienna who have called {{p10}} to meet the Master, either through curiosity or interest.

At noon the Master and all of us accompanying him went out to take a walk in the National park. After half an hour walk he rested in a cupola in front of the Lake to watch the ducks and geese and swans! They were very pretty and of many colors. He was enthusiastic in his praise of them. He went out of the Park with our brother Bageroff to dinner to the house of a "Persian friend".

As we were walking back, a young man {{p11}} approached and inquired whether we are Persians. After some conversation it turned out that he was a Bahai from Tabriz and he wanted to come to Paris to see the Master. Mirza Ali Akbar had given him the address on Mon. Dreyfus; he was so glad when he heard that the Master was here. About five o'clock he came to the hotel and was presented to him. Incidentally I may slate that Mirza Ali Akbar who was with Abdul Baha in America has returned to Haifa and is awaiting his arrival {{p12}} and the other Mirza Ali Akbar has gone from Luzanne to London.

### Grand Hotel, Wien I.Karntnerring. April 23rd 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

This is the last day we are in Vienna and tomorrow morning at ten we leave for Stuttgart from Westbanhoff station. Here during these few days the Cause was well spread, many people have become deeply interested and ere long Vienna will be one of the many Bahai Centers. The pure seeds of the word of God were sown and God shall cause them to grow through the downpour of the rain of Mercy and the wafting of the gentle breezes. We are all very hopeful as to the future of the Cause {{p2}} in Vienna.

One of the most amusing reports which somehow has been given out innocently by someone was that Abdul Baha was a fortune-teller. Therefore for the last few days most of those who came to have an interview with Abdul Baha inquired about their future. This morning two ladies arrived very early, each carrying in her hand a bouquet of flowers and after the preliminary greeting, asked the Master what kind of progress will they make in the future? There are two kinds of progress, {{p3}} the Beloved said, Spiritual progress and material progress. Material progress is temporal and vanishing, for no matter how much man may advance his body, at last he shall become subject to death; but there is no limit to spiritual progress and its results are infinite and glorious. For you, therefore I desire this spiritual progress which is eternal.

Someone asked how can she better assist the world? The Master said: Assistance is of two kinds: Material assistance and spiritual assistance. {{p4}} Material assistance is limited to one locality and place but spiritual assistance is measureless. However if a person is enabled to render assistance in both ways, then, it is light upon light. But if he cannot render material assistance, he must not feel sad, because he is not responsible. You must not feel unhappy, because you are not rich. Strive then to assist the world spiritually. Consider how many souls have assisted the community with millions yet its result has not been widespread, but those souls who have arisen to guide the people spiritually, their {{p5}} results are unlimited. Therefore make ye an effort to gain this power. In what way will you gain this power? By entrance in the Kingdom of Baha-wllah. Then shall ye be surrounded with invisible confirmations. There are many women in Persia who have no worldly possession whatever, but they render spiritual assistance to the people. You must likewise make an effort as that you may guide and educate the souls spiritually. Do not attach your hearts to the worldly possessions. Attachment alloys happiness. {{p6}} There are some people who dream that if they had ten thousand dollars, they would be happy; but they do not know that those who have already 10,000 dollars are unhappy and sad because they do not have 100,000 and so on. If you want to be happy, attach your hearts to nothing. Be ye free, so that ye may be always joyful. Attach your heart to spiritual principles. They are the divine virtues, heavenly perfections, the knowledge of God, the Love of God and the attractions of the spirits.

{{p7}}

Someone asked what is the Bahai Cause. The Master said: The Cause of Baha-wllah is incomparable to any other Cause, because it is the Collective Center of this age. This Cause regenerates the souls, everyone receives a new egotism and attains to the station of the new birth. If he was a liar, he becomes truthful, whereas formerly he was coward, he becomes courageous. Whereas formerly he was morally sailed, he becomes pure. Whereas formerly he was ignorant, he become wise. He is transformed entirely into the angelic state. Any person, undergoing this process of {{p8}} purification, know ye of a certainty that he is a Bahai, otherwise he has only changed his ideas and is a Bahai in name. All the present communities do only change their names, but in the Bahai Cause, it is different. If a person was dark, he become illumined, characterized with the attributes of Holiness and Sanctity; he will be set aglow with the Fire of the Love of God; and will become a new creation. The Bahai Cause is the fountain of Job. Whosoever enters therein will become freed from all the moral and spiritual diseases. I hope all the people {{p9}} will attain to this high station.

One of the Theosophists asked the Master to write in her book. On the page having the date of May 23rd being his birthday he wrote the following: "O Thou Sun of Reality! Cast Thou a splendour from the Light of Reality upon the heart and conscious of this seeker of Reality."

Someone suggested it will be very good if a meeting between Abdul Baha and a prominent Austrian Count could brought about. The Master said: The thirsty one must run {{p10}} after the water; the fountain will not run after those who are thirsty.

Another visitor asked: "What is the greatest duty of man in this world?" The Master said: To enter in the Kingdom of God is the greatest and most important duty.

One inquired: "How can the heart be consoled?" The Master said: The greatest consolation for the heart is the Love of God. This is the balm for every wound and the remedy for every ailment. This world is full of pain and afflictions. Therefore the foundation upon which the eternal consolation of the human heart is based {{p11}} is the Love of God. Every new day bring in its train new difficulties and ordeals. The world is very dark and the only light which is capable to penetrate through this darkness is the Light of Love of God and entrance into the Kingdom of Baha-wllah. This is the Cause of happiness! This is the means of consolation! The glory of man is through the Love of God, entrance into His Kingdom and being involved with His divine characteristics.

All morning a stream of callers received the encouragement and inspiration of the {{p12}} the Master. As one of the ladies said: "I don't know why I came here but I feel so happy to be near the Master. Since I have seen him, I like to fly with happiness. With a look, a few words and a smile, he has entirely transformed my life. I feel in my heart the springing up of new hopes, new inspirations, the stirring of new ideals." In the afternoon several Persians came and the Master spoke about the wonderful blessings which will descend in the future upon Persia and how that country will become very beloved, because the Peace-maker of the world {{p13}} has been born there.

Arrangements were made that Baroness Bertha Von Suttner, the great Austrian percipient may call on the Master at 3:30 pm. Before her arrival, the Beloved sent to her a large bouquet of roses, lilacs and lily of the valley. She has written many books on Universal Peace, one of her most famous works is "Lay down the arms". As she entered the room she expressed sorrow over the events of the past few months, a note of hopelessness and pessimism and of despondency on her tongue. The Master came back with hope. Ah, {{p14}} the day of Hope hath dawned! After every sorrow there is joy, after every night there is the glorious day. God willing through your efforts, we will succeed. I have heard much of your name and your unselfish service to the Cause of Peace. I testify that you are a lover of humanity. Baroness B. Von Suttner: "I am very grateful for your words of encouragements and inspirations. I have done very little and with less results."

A.B. You have sown the seeds and God shall cause them to grow.

B.S. I hope so.
{{p15}} 

A.B. I have been looking forward to this visit. While I was in Chicago and Omaha you were there of the same time but it was not destined that we meet each other. I had to come to Austria to pay you a visit.

B.S. I was very sorry that I could not meet you in America for I have always heard of this Movement.

A.B. Yes! One of the greatest teachings of Baha-wllah is regarding international Peace. We must not lose our hope and courage. The beginning of a {{p16}} downpour of rain is only a few drops. In the early dawn, the Sun rises slowly, giving us here and there a few feeble rays but it is sure that before long it will be stationed in the meridian of its glory. Truly I say, the spirit of this age is universal Peace. In every age a great impelling idea has been born and developed. There has been an age of sehabaslicism, another age belonging to the development of philosophy and natural sciences. The lost age was the age of freedom and the march of democracy throughout many lands. But this 20th century is the century of the promotion of international {{p17}} Peace, the proclamation of the oneness of the world of humanity, the brotherhood of man, the union of religions, the solidarity of various nations and the universalization of all the great ideals, common to the children of man. All the people are the sheep and God is the real Shepherd of this flock and is kind to all. The earth is one sphere. This geographical boundaries are made by man, calling one piece of land Austria, another Germany, a third French, a fourth England and so forth. The days in Oriental cities instinctively divide the various quarters {{p18}} amongst themselves and if by chance one crosses the boundary of another, he will be attacked. But these boundary lines are all imaginary. They have no real existence.

B.S. I had never heard this before. But I suppose those days are not aggressive. They are satisfied with their own domain and do not carry fire and sword in their neighbour's home.

A.B. You are right! Aggression is the attribute of man and the ferocious beasts but the domestic animals never fight.
Much more could I write on the interesting conversation of the Master and the Baroness {{p19}} but space forbids. Towards the end he invited her to come to the Orient because the Bahais who are the servants of Peace will be glad to see and hear her. She thanked the Master for the lovely flowers. They were not flowers, he said. They were the expressions of my esteem and admiration for your noble services to the Cause of humanity. She left the Presence of the Master much impressed and I am sure this interview will be of incalculable benefit to the Cause in Austria.

Then the Master dictated two Tablets for Mr. and Mrs. {{p20}} Stark and Mr. Moore of Budapest. I was standing near the window writing and he was walking back and forth. As he dictated he become so excited that several times he approached where I stood, shouting the words into my ears and his eyes were ablaze with the fire of divine enthusiasm. I could feel through every fibre of my being his wonderful spirit and energy. Suddenly he wheeled around and before finishing the sentence, he slapped my face so powerfully that not only I was dazed but its reverberating noise brought other Persians who were in their adjoining rooms. {{p21}} The Master laughing heartily asked them: Did you hear it? Did you hear it? I was giving Mirza Ahmad just a love-pat or rather his daily wages, and again he broke forth into laugh and continued dictating.

In the middle of all this the bell was rung and Mrs. Stark rushed in. What! Mrs. Stark here in Wien? She was bubbling over with life and spiritual power! The Master was so pleased to see her. He told her: I have just dictated a Tablet to you and your {{p22}} husband. I have a special attachment to you and Mr. Stark and will always pray for you! She said she was now on her way to a summer resort for a rest of ten days. Already 25 people in Budapest have expressed their belief in Baha-wllah and on her return they will have their first meeting and start to translate the Words into Hungarian language. "Everybody speaks about the Cause" she said, with the greatest reverence. They respect us more than ever before because are Bahais. We will do everything to spread the Cause. She brought to us copies of a Hungarian {{p23}} magazine containing the picture of the Master and also a group picture taken in Budapest.

Then at five thirty the Master called on the Persian Ambassador with Ahmad Bageroff and it was about 7:30 when he came to the Theosophical Society directly from the Embassy. We were all there waiting for him, meanwhile Mr. Herrigel was speaking in German about the Cause to the assembled {{p24}} audience. On his arrival he said: I am so tired. I have been talking for two hours and now I must talk again. Let me rest at least for a minute or two. After awhile he entered the large hall. At his entrance everyone arose and he spoke a great silence of attention fell over the audience. He spoke on how all the manifestations of God have ever came from the East, gave a resume of the principles and the life of Baha-wllah and finally ended his address by delivering a wonderful prayer in Persian. The prayer was not translated. The people preferring to hear {{p25}} the voice of the Master without interruption.

I will bring this to a close with a translation of the same: "O Thou King of Existence! O Thou Kind Beloved! The members of this meeting are the lovers of Thy Face. They seek after Thee and they long to converse with Thee. They are the investigators of Reality and the wooers of Thy Countenance! They are thirsty for Thy salubrious stream and have turned their attention toward Thee. O Thou Kind Beloved! {{p26}} Illumined the world of humanity! Enlighten the hearts with the effulgence of Thy Love! Perfume the nostrils with Thy sweet Fragrances. Confer upon us a new Bestowal! Give unto us a strong power! Open the eyes! Make the ears hearing! O God! Thirsty are we, Thy Grace is the cooling spring! Homeless and shelterless are we. Thy court is the asylum for these poor ones. Indigent are we, give unto us the Treasury of Thy Kingdom. Prisoners are we, free us from ought else same Thee. Nameless and traceless are we, accept us at Thy divine Threshold! O God! Do not look upon our desert. Have mercy upon us! Be compassionate to us! Grant us Thy Favour and guide us to the right Path. Verily Thou art the Powerful and Mighty."



### Grand Hotel, Wien I.Karntnerring. April 24th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

We were up early this morning to pack up our bags. All yesterday I had a bad headache and so when last night we arrived from the Theosophical Society. I felt almost dead and after writing half an hour I found myself later sleeping over the desk. Yesterday many people came to see the Beloved showing the great interest on the part of the people. This morning Mr. Edder, Mrs. Thaller, Mr. and Mrs. Luckneder and others came to say goodbye to him. Mrs. Luckneder brought a bouquet of {{p2}} red roses with lily of the valleys. I could not bring anything sweeter and more fragrant than these flowers for they relate to you the story of our love and attachment to your Cause more than our poor words can express. The Master told them: Praise be to God that means were brought about for me to come to Vienna. I shall never forget these days spent with you with joy and fragrance. I found souls here who are awakened and intelligent and who love to serve the world of humanity. I hope also that you will not forget me. I will ever remember you, {{p3}} I will ever pray for you and beg divine guidance for you. You must now arise to teach this Cause. First teach yourselves and then teach others.

At nine o'clock and fifteen minutes we left the hotel, Mr. Herrigel and Ahmad Bageroff going ahead of us to buy tickets. The Master as usual gave a great deal of money to the maids, servants, messenger boys and a host of other servants. The Manager came personally and thanked him. Ahmad Bageroff will {{p4}} return from Vienna to Persia, thus we are losing a fine travelling companion. The Master wrote him a beautiful Tablet with His own hand.

From ten o'clock in the morning to 2:10 minutes after midnight we travelled. The train stopping one hour in each city. We passed many mountains capped with snow. The Master devoted much of his time to the reading of letters. Mr. Herrigel talked with two ladies going to Munich about the Cause and brought {{p5}} them to the Master. He spoke to each a few minutes giving them the glad-tidings of this Glorious Day and exhorting to investigate more about this great Cause. At one o'clock we had our lunch and at three the Master was served with his tea.

It was about just 2 hours after midnight when our train made a short stop in Esslinger and lo and behold, there were four Bahais waiting to greet the Master. They had their tickets and accompanied us to Stuttgart.

In the station there {{p6}} were more than twelve Bahais amongst them Consul Schevaz, Mrs. Herrigel, Bertha Bahmuller, Miss Stabler, Miss Anna Kosthin, Marie Schwaizer, Miss Thurer, Mr. Thaunman etc. Just think of it! Two o'clock a.m. to came to the station! They were all supremely happy to greet again the Master in Stuttgart. He shook hands with each and immediately was taken to the Hotel Marquardt. He has the room 141 second floor and we have the same number of rooms as before. He may stay two nights here. Tomorrow night he will speak on a public hall. The newspapers have announced the meeting so I suppose there will be a whole lot of people.



### HOTEL MARQUARDT STUTTGART April 25th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

We are again back in Stuttgart and are feeling the warmth and the affections of the friends of God. Their heavenly sincerity, their divine love for the Cause, their burning devotion to the Master, their unflinching faith in the revelation of Baha-wllah, their spiritual perception of the realities of this Movement, their supreme desire to serve, their affection and amity amongst themselves will melt the stony heart of any person who comes in touch with them, looks into their happy shining faces and speaks with them on the spiritual verities of life. The believers in Stuttgart are really Bahais. They live and act in accord with the Teachings and principles of the Blessed Perfection and they try to help others and spread the message to the extent of their knowledge and ability. They know that this is the seed-sowing time and like unto good farmers, they have availed themselves of this unparalleled opportunity. Everyone knows his duty. Every soldier to his post. With their disciplined ranks they are attacking the fortifications of the myrmidons of darkness and ignorance and step by step they are gaining the ground. Desperately they shall fight till their struggle is crowned with success and they {{p2}} have planted their flag of "ya Baha El Abha" on that you hill of Light, putting to rout and defeat the army of darkness.

Today the Master did not feel well. The trace of the cold taken in Budapest is yet with him. He could not sleep last night, coughing most of the time. We feel so wretched whenever he feels sick, because we cannot see him suffer and often he would not tell us his real pain till it is all over. It is a strange coincidence that when we arrived last night in the hotel about 2:15 am and our rooms were assigned, I did not feel sleepy at all and having changed my clothes, I sat behind the desk and wrote till the sun downed from the Eastern horizon. I find always the late hours after midnight and the early wee hours of the morning better suited for my scribbling. It is most interesting to watch the gloomy darkness of the night transformed slowly into the bright light of the day. It is so much like the changes going on through the inner man. A sudden light breaking through the darkness, changing everything and clothing the essences of humanity with the white garment of sanctity and iridescent intelligence. Often have I witnessed this invisible transformation of heart affected so naturally and simply by the mighty power of the Master!

{{p3}}

This morning New York herald of European edition contained an item of news which cheered the heart of the Master. It was as regards a speed given by Mr. W. J. Bryan, the Secretary of State at a farewell dinner to Mr. James Bryce. His idea of a reduction of the American Navy and a policy of gradual disarmament is a hopeful sign of the spread of the desire for universal Peace. I am pleased, he said, to hear the voice of Mr. Bryan raised from time to time in favor of peace. While travelling in America I often mentioned the fact that as the American nation is a noble nation and as the American government is fair and just. I hope the Banner of international Peace will be unfurled here. Now I am very happy to see these hopeful signs coming from that wonderful country.

Speaking about the great expenses of this Western trip he said: The believers of Persia made the greatest self-sacrifice and this trip was made possible. They made large and small contributions and as this was for the sake of the promotion of the Word of God we in turn did not observe the dictates of economy. In every matter, first of all I consider the glory of the {{p4}} Cause of God. All these expenses which are being made are for the promulgation of the Bahai principles in the world. We do not charge anything for them. Freely we have received freely we give. For two years and half we have been travelling and we hope to finish this tour with joy and fragrance and the great glorification of the Cause of God. My affairs are very strange and few can understand my motives. For example for the last 2 years and half I have not sent one dollar to my own family to buy clothes with, neither have I bought for them one yard of cloth But I bought this winter more than one hundred overcoats for the poor of Acca. One who may hear these things may not believe in them but nevertheless they are true.

Mr. Herrigel and Dr. Fisher came and translated an article which had appeared yesterday in a local paper. It was a very good one and I enclose a copy of the paper in a separate package with others.

Mrs. Consul Schwarz with her two daughters and sons came to pay a visit to the Master. He said: You are the members of my own family. God bears testimony {{p5}} that there is no distinction. I love you very much. You are my own daughter and your children are my grandchildren. While we were away we often remembered you and were grateful for your services to the Cause. The little young man was a pet of the Master and was loved very much by him. He was surrounded today with his affection and tenderness.

To another group who entered in his Presence with fragrant roses in their hands: I have come back again to Stuttgart. This shows that Stuttgart has a great deal of capability and the people are worthy of entrance in the Kingdom of Abha. God willing the Cause of God will advance greatly in Stuttgart and its promotion will be extraordinary, many souls shall accept the revelation and all will be made happy.

Consul Schwaz invited the Master to eat in his home after the meeting but he excused himself because he did not feel well. He felt as though he could not go tonight to the meeting, he wanted us to go, Mirza Mahmoud to chant a prayer, myself to speak and Mr. Herrigel to read the translation {{p6}} of the Master's address in the Jewish Synagogue in San Francisco. We were all very disappointed, especially this meeting has been announced in the papers and many strangers would naturally come and not hearing the Master would go away unsatisfied.

Miss Alma Knoblock and a few of the friends were introduced into his Presence. They were greeted most heartily. The love of Baha-wllah, the Master said, is the essence of happiness. Any heart which will become the depository of this love is always happy. There have been many people sad and despondent but as soon as the sun of the love of Baha-wllah shown in their hearts they become happy. Therefore you must be very happy because you are living in the day of the Blessed Perfection. All the prophets longed for this day. They yearned for one moment of this time. Appreciate the value of this age. The more you appreciate the glories of these days, the greater will be your blessings.

A friend asked how can we ever keep {{p7}} this before our minds all the time? often we desire to do it but in the hurry and rush of time we will forget it. He said: A Real Bahai who acts and lives in accord with the teachings of Baha-wllah will never forget.

Someone expressed the disappointment that the people will experience tonight in not finding the Master in the meeting. He said: My spirit will be there. You must speak with great confidence and set the hearts on fire. You must turn your face to the Kingdom of Abha. Rely upon the Confirmation of God. Sincerity is the keynote of eloquence. Look at me. I have not entered any school. I have not studied the sciences of the world but my trust is in Baha-wllah. Whenever I want to enter any meeting I say "O Baha-wllah! Confirm me".

To another one he said: When I was in Paris I caught a cold, in Budapest I caught a another, in Vienna it accompanied me and while there, I walked up twice 120 steps to the fourth floor to speak to the Theosophical Society, and last night {{p8}} on the train I felt the chills. Now it is impossible for me to go to the meeting tonight. You express my apology and deep sorrow in not being able to come. For lunch he ate a bowl of clear broth and was in bed all afternoon. Just the same, many people came and he spoke to them and encouraged them to go on teaching the Cause and spreading the message.

While he was lying in bed he told me two stories; both showing courage, his pluck, resourcefulness and supreme confidence and divine knowledge in his youth. The first story runs as follows: During the first year of our arrival in Bagdad one day Mirza Javad asked me to go out with him to an outlying district. At this time, Arabian robbers frequented the roads and no one dared to go out of the tavern. In the morning we two started to walk to that district. Having spent part of the day, toward the evening we started to return. However, before leaving Bagdad, Mirza Javad took for precautions sake, and old rifle he had carried around for many years. As we were walking back toward the city we spied in the far off horizon, several horsemen coming toward us. {{p9}} Seeing we were all alone, they galloped toward our left and right and back so that we may not run away and in front of us three men appeared with rifles in their hands. Mirza Javad was much agitated. He got hold of his rifle but to his further confusion he realized that he had neither powder nor cartridges so his rifle was more useless than a piece of stick. Then I told him take your rifle in your hand, keeping it in a position as though he was going to aim at them. Don't heed them at all. Don't look at them. Walk straight. Laugh and speak with me. The three men ahead of us cried out "down with your rifle!" Mirza Javad did not give any attention to them. They were amazed at our audacity! "Down with your arm!" they cried all at once. No result. They were cowered and paced back a few steps. In this way we walked and laughed and talked till we reached the gate of the city and all the time our "friends" going backward. When the horsemen saw the futility of their pursuit, they spied another pedestrian on the road and galloped toward him. This man seeing {{p10}} us coming with a rifle in hand hastened towards us and cried for protection from the robbers. Meanwhile the gate was opened and our "friends" realizing the hopelessness of their hide back into the darkness. We did not have anything but the other man had some money and was grateful to us because we saved him. Addressing Mirza Javad he said: I am glad you did not kill them. The way you took your rifle in your hands I thought every moment you will shoot at them. Here the Master had a hearty laugh and added: And all this time our rifle was empty.

The other story illustrates his wonderful versality during conversation: I was only fifteen. One day in the Mosque of Bagdad I was surrounded by a number of Mohamadan Clergy. They were asking many questions about jurisprudence law, logic etc. Although I had never read their books, yet I was giving them answers {{p11}} which satisfied and at the same time caused them great astonishment. While I was speaking to them on theological doctrines, suddenly I saw the governor entered the circle of the listeners. Immediately I felt that the governor being a philosophic man abhorred such dry theological discussions so without any preliminary remark I quoted a verse from the Koran in which it is said: "Therefore Moses cried out, O Lord! let me behold Thy Face" and the Lord answered: "Look and thou shall see me! (Now according to the orthodox school of theology the "face of God" cannot be seen, because they argue; God is spirit and formless and how can a formless spirit be endowed with face?) Then I said: We all believe that the prophets of God never speak vainly and their words are the words of truth. Therefore if it was impossible to see the face of God Moses would have not asked it, neither would he have received such a favorable reply on {{p12}} the part of God. The Mohamadan clergymen were all the time wondering why I changed the topic of my conversation but seeing the governor in their midst all aglow with attention they understood. Then I desired to mollify them so that they may not think I am a heretic in teaching them the incarnation of God in the flesh, therefore, I continued my talk: Verily when Moses drunk the wine of the Love of God and heard the voice of the Lord and was submerged in the sea of abstraction - he forgot the world and all therein and saw himself in the "Abode of Paradise" and as the "Abode of Paradise" is the station of divine transfiguration and visitation, therefore he cried out: O Lord! Let me behold Thy Face! The governor was so interested that he invited me that night to his house to speak to his friends. The clergymen were angry and thought this was an oratorical trickery and cleverness, but it was the confirmation and inspiration of God.

{{p13}}

About 8 o'clock Mr. Herrigel came and as the Berger Museum where the meeting will be held is near we walked to it. As I entered the large hall and saw the expectant happy crowd I felt in my heart the pangs of pain. There were more than 1500 people present and people were coming in, filling the galleries. Consul Schwarz, Mirza Mahmoud and myself had a hasty consultation and thought it our duty to notify the Master about the unusual aspect of this meeting. It was evidently the largest gathering ever brought together to hear the Bahai Cause in Germany. With Consul Schwarz I rushed out of the hall, called an automobile and were in the room of the Master in three minutes. He had just taken some simple Persian medicine and was sitting the chair. I told him of the greatness of the meeting and the Consul pleaded to come just for a few minutes. He thought {{p14}} for a minute or two and for the sake of the Consul decided to go, although he did not feel well at all. We were of course overjoyed. When we entered the hall, the audience was listening to a very good address by Mr. Herrigel on the life and ideals of the Master and when they heard that he had come, their enthusiasm knew no bound. They arose from their seats and gave him a wonderful reception. It was a waving, moving sea of humanity, all eager to hear the words of the Master. Many of them had come from the surrounding towns. The Master ascended the platform and sat on a chair and without any introduction started to speak. His address on this unique occasion was a matchless beauty which will be set on the crown of Stuttgart. His voice, his love, his sympathy won all the hearts. When he finished his short speech many eyes were weeping. We had a good translator, the Prof. of English language in the university of this city. He translated with ready diction and much feeling. When the Master came down from the platform {{p15}} many strangers gathered around him, trying to shake and kiss his hands. A lady was so affected by his words that she run to him weeping. She got hold of his arm, and walked by his side till he reached the automobile. All along the steps and the hall two columns of men and women were formed and we passed in their midst, all looking at the Master with reverence and respect. I was walking behind him carrying in my arm the love-offering of many people - roses and carnations, lilacs and lily of the valleys. When we reached the car hundreds of people those who could not enter the hall had gathered. Hats were raised and handkerchiefs were waving when they saw the Master coming down from the stairs. The car carried away the King of Kings amidst the rejoicing and happiness of all these devout people!

{{p16}}

The Master said in the car: It was a remarkable meeting and its effect in the Bahai world will be far-reaching. Consul Schwarz was of course the happiest man in the world because at last the Cause was publicly proclaimed before the people of Stuttgart! He said: You have won the hearts of our people with love and the renown of this spiritual victory shall reverberate throughout all ages. The Beloved was also pleased because his Presence gave so much joy to so many people. It was indeed an ideal triumph! Miss Pollock is here yet and I was glad to see her last night. She brought three people to the meeting and she was all enkindled with the Fire of the Love of God!

He is God!

O ye two revered souls!

Since the day of my departure from Budapest I have been always remembering you and have begged from his holiness Baha-wllah protection and providence for you, so that divine spirituality and the Bestowals of the Kingdom of Abha may surround you and the most holy Power may so reveal itself in your hearts that from all your limbs the cry of "Ya Baha El Abha" may raised and be heard by all the people. With one hand may you upraise the heavenly Banner and with the other hand, may you hold the overflowing cup with the wine of the Love of God, offering it to all and exhilarating everyone with its spiritual nectar. Open ye the eloquent tongues and utter ye fluent speeches. Sing ye such a melody that while I am in the East {{p18}} I may hear its clear echo and all the Bahais may become rejoiced and happy.

Convey to all the friends the wonderful Abha greeting Upon ye be Baha El Abha!

O thou servant of Baha-wllah and the beloved of Abdul Baha!

Thy letter was received and its contents imported the utmost happiness. Praise be to God that my journey to Budapest was productive of certain definite results, for the people were attracted to the Kingdom of Abha and enkindled with the Fire of the Love of God. During the Dispensation of Christ notwithstanding the power of the Holy Spirit only eleven souls were attracted but during the nine days stay in Budapest blessed souls entered the Kingdom of Abha. Now consider how marvellous is the potency of the Kingdom of Abha that as soon as the call was raised, the souls were attracted and set aglow with the Fire of the Love of God. If at the present time such results are becoming manifest, reflect what will transpire in the future! Eleven souls become believers and assured during the days of Christ. Now behold the results!

After a short while thou shall hear that the cry of "ye Baha El Abha" is being raised from all the continents of the world.

Give my special greeting to thy respectful wife and show the utmost of love on my behalf to thy beloved sons.

Upon thee be Baha El Abha!

Dear Harriet!

This was Saturday and all day I was in Spirit with the New York friends, the luncheon at our dear sister Mrs Krug, the Executive Business meeting and the general reception. I hope all the noble efforts of the believers are crowned with success and the result of the Convention will be a general spread of the Cause and the closer relationship of the different assemblies. When the friends of the different cities come together, the spirit, the spirit of mutual friendship and love is increased and the hearts are tied together with the golden thread of spiritual affection. I hope to receive the good reports of the Convention days for they are marked days in the Bahai calendar. How strange and mystical that last year at this time the Master was in America and this year, he is in Germany! This may in itself be a symbol of the future ideal friendship of these two countries!

{{p2}}

One of the newspapers contained quite a long article on last night's meeting and it was translated to the Master. He feels much better this morning and right early the people commenced to come. To the first group of friends he said: What did the people say last night? Were they not dissatisfied? Did they not exclaim what this Persian has to do with us? Why has he come to Germany? What do we want to do with these pacific principles? Let peace be for the weaker nations but war is for the mighty! Germany is a warlike, demonstrative nation! This morning looking down from the window, I saw a regiment of soldiers passing by in fine shape. They were ready to fight for the fatherhood. How barbarous and foolish it is to send men who know not each other at all to the battlefield and order them to shoot down each other and cut one another's throat. But friends let us talk about our own war. Our Grand Army consists of the invisible angles of the Supreme {{p3}} Concourse; our swords are the swords of light. Our armaments are the invincible armaments of heaven. We are fighting against the forces of darkness. Oh! My soldiers! My beloved soldiers, forward! Forward! Have no fear of defeat! Have no failing hearts! Our Supreme Commander is Baha-Ullah! From the height of his glory he is directing this dramatic engagement. He commands us. Push onwards, push forward! Show the strength of your arms! Ye shall scatter the powers of ignorance! Your war confers life, theirs brings death. Your war is the cause of the illumination of human kind; theirs is the means of the darkness of the hearts. Your war is victory upon victory; their war is defeat upon defeat. Your war is the source of construction; their war is the origin of destruction. There are no dangers before you. Push forward! Fire! Fire! Attack the enemy! Your efforts {{p4}} shall be crowned with the diadem of eternal Peace and brotherhood! See ye not the crown of victory shining from the Kingdom of Abha? His Holiness the Christ was fighting even upon the Cross and his triumphs have continued throughout all centuries and cycles!

To a Bahai farmer who has come from one of the towns of Switzerland to see the aster he said: Two years ago I was in Tonou. I was staying in a hotel. I found the hotel people who consisted mostly of Tourists upon the pursuit of pleasure but walking in the streets and looking in the faces of the inhabitants, I observed intelligence, industry, capability and seriousness. They are very good people and are ready to receive the glad-tidings of the kingdom. If the fragrances of this holy Cause waft by that country, blessed souls shall arise to serve the world of humanity.

To another group of the Bahais he said: You must be very happy because you are of those souls whom God has chosen for the sake of his love and has guided you to his Kingdom. He has crowned our heads with the diadems of everlasting glory. You must be most thankful to god for this great Favor. It is known for the present what wonderful bounty is this! It will become known in the future. The station of those souls who believed in Christ in his oven day was not appreciated. They were ridiculed and scorned.

Someone asked the Master whether he is happy. He said: I am happy whenever I meet you. The greatest pleasure of my life is to meet people like you. Whenever I look upon each one of you, I believe you are one of my nearest relatives. Now I have again returned to see you.

Another group entered his Presence. They expressed happiness over the result {{p6}} of last night's meeting and how the people were attracted to the cause and to him. He said: Although I could not walk one step last night and it was quite dangerous to go out I said I will go. The utmost is that will become a sacrifice to the friends of God. My greatest longing is also to sacrifice myself in the path of the believers. There is nothing sweeter and more wonderful than this! But praise is to God, we went, we spoke, we met the people, we returned and nothing happened. God has protected us. So, when I said last night that to go to the meeting was equal to throw myself into the sea, I meant the sea of love. When God interferes with our places we are helpless. First I come to Stuttgart to stay only two days. I stayed 8 days. Now, again I desired to leave today but sickness preventing me to do so I am going to stay longer. There must be wisdom in this.

{{p7}}

This comes from the sincerity of the friends of Stuttgart. Undoubtedly my longer stay will have imparted results. The first result will be the creation of love in the hearts of the believers. The second result will be the progress of the Cause in Germany. The third result will be the penetration of the word of God.

To a caller he said: I am glad to see you. The meeting of the friends is the food of the spirit. To a friend who had seen a vision he said: This vision is an indication of thy advancement in the Love of God.

About noon many of the believers came. The Master received them with love and said: I will pray in your behalf and entreat divine Confirmation for each one of you so that you may so advance in spiritual life as to attract to the Cause every soul who comes in contact with you just as you have attracted me.

{{p8}} 

Your love has attracted me to this city. I hope that day unto day your love may increase. I am most pleased and happy with you. May you become more enkindled with the Fire of the Love of God, so that through the Light of the Kingdom you may illumine all these religions. I love you very much. Should you realize how much I love you, you will soon with happiness in the atmosphere of God. Consul Schwarz asked the Master whether he would like to consult a doctor. He said: God is my physician. He will treat me.

{{p9}}

Miss Pollock had a pleasant interview with the Master. He joked with her about his second trip to America. If I want to go to America, I will take you with me and leave Ahmad here. We do not need any interpreter. We will travel in {{p10}} an airship and go right to Washington and alight at the door of Mrs Allen's house. How do you like this? She was of course very happy but she wanted to have the interpreter in the airship also, in order to make the aerial navigation more pleasant. Then he asked her whether last night the people were happy or frowning, and he frowned so that made us all laugh heartily.

Doctor Faber, a celebrated physician of Morgeutheim who has declared he publicly to be a Bahai called on the Beloved and invited him to go for a month to Morgeutheim and take the mineral baths every day. The Master said: You take the baths in my place and I will get well. The Doctor thought he could not represent the Master to that extent, but in order to make him and the rest laugh he told the following story: One of the Kings of Persia once got sick. This {{p11}} King was very proud and despotic. All the people at the court feared him and cowered before him. One day he sent for the Court physician to treat him. When the physician arrived and prescribed a large dose of quinine the King in his wrath cried out . Who should take this medicine? The physician fearing the anger of the King said, "I am the one to take the quinine," "All right," the King said and he ordered his chaucherlain to bring the largest dose of quinine and made his physician to take it. By mere chance, the health of the King was improved and after a while he got well. From that time on whenever he became sick he sent for his physician and made him take a dose of quinine. Then the Master applying the moral of the story, said to Doctor {{p12}} that you take the mineral baths and I will get well, even if i am not there. Mr and Ms Herrigel, Miss Knoblock, Consul Schwarz, his wife and daughter and many others came in the afternoon and each one had interesting interviewed going out of his Presence inspired and refreshed, To Mr Herrigel he said: The future of the Cause in Germany is very bright Likewise Budapest and Vienna will become Bahai Centres. One could never have believed that such whole and pure souls will be found in those cities. The Cause of God will be spread in all those countries. The progress of the Cause is like unto the coming of the spring and its early signs. Suddenly one sees here a tree is putting for to leaves, there a bush being adorned with roses, the nightingales are singing and the meadows are seen!  

{{p13}}

Often letters were received from unknown places, giving the news that some souls are found who are attracted to the Kingdom of Abha. These are the signs of the spiritual springtime. Thou shalt become assisted in the service of the Cause so that the morality of the people may be improved; the souls may become regenerated and the hearts cleansed from the impurity of vices and defects. This matter of the regeneration of the moral life of man is quite important. Where this is realized one fluid himself in a wonderful spiritual atmosphere which is impossible to describe; he finds himself a ruler over all things, he is the controller and the Master of his own destiny, he gains strength and illumination, he became like unto the ray of the Sun. 

{{p14}}

About five o'clock Mirza Mahmoud and myself were in our rooms when the Master sent Sayad Assadollah after us to have tea with him. He  offered a cup with his own hand to me and said: Mirza Ahmad, drink this cup of tea and "see" how delicious it is. This is the nectar of life! Drink it and thank God that in Stuttgart Abdul Baha is serving thee tea. We must thank God for all his bounties. Let me tell you a story which has come just now to my mind, Abdul Baha said. When I was in Baghdad, one day I was walking through the poor quarter of the city. I saw an old Arab standing in front of store. He had neither hat nor shoes and wore only a long tottered coat over his naked body. He had no shirt. Between his coat and his skin, he had a loaf of coarse black bread. {{p15}} His appearance attracted my attention and I stopped in a corner to watch him what he is going to do. As I stood there i saw him putting his hand in his breast, taking out a piece of bread, looking at it with the utmost satisfaction and smile then raising his head toward the sky, saying 'O, God I thank Thee for this Thy Favor' and then eating it. He continued to do the same thing for every piece of bread he did put in his mouth with the utmost simplicity and trust. This thanksgiving of him attracted me very much and I went to him and invited him to dinner. Having given him the address, I returned home and ordered the preparation of pillow and chicken. When he came and the table was spread before him he looked at the various dishes with wonder in his eyes. "Come, sit down and eat. {{p16}} This dinner is prepared for thee," I said. "Really," he said, "this is the food of Paradise but it lacks one thing." "What is it?" "Sour milk." "All right. You shall get that too" and I sent someone to get it for him. When everything was ready, I told him: "Now start eating but with the same thankfulness , you ate your bread yesterday." I did not need to say that, he would have done it anyway but we enjoyed seeing him so thankful.

He continued telling us other stories illustrating the thanksgiving of man to his Master for all the blessings which He showers upon him.

Reading to him an item of news about the capture of Sentauri by Montenegrons . He said: When Baha-Ullah was imprisoned in the Barrack of Acca, he could see the disintegration of Ottoman Empire under the despotic and fanatical {{p17}} rule of the Sultans; for He said: the only things that will stop the tide of misfortune is the proclamation of complete equality and the enjoyment of the freedom of rights by all the Ottoman subjects, Mohamadans, and Christians, Jews and Armenians, etc.

Speaking about the progress of the Cause he said: Many blessed and holy should have appeared in this Cause who has been the essence of essences. That is why the Cause is so wonderfully spread all over the world. These holy souls were the means of upraising the Bahai standard. The Islands of Jove, Sumatra and one other contains millions of inhabitants and many of them were converted from idolatry into Mohammeden religion by one single person. {{p18}} Just think of that Mohammeden missionary attraction and of accomplishing such a mighty task! When he finished his work he left the Islands for an unknown destination and after that no one heard anything about him. Even his name is not known. Now it is evident that one single soul was greater than a million of the present day. Whereas for he worked for God and not for fame or name or wealth. There is the proverb that "one man is equal to one thousand"; one man maybe the cause of the illumination of one city filling it with his services and his impersonal humanity. For example the city of <unreadable> in Persia was formerly very active and alive in the Cause, but today it is as though entirely extinct. This is because at that time there was {{p19}} one real, genuine, enthusiastic Bahai and he kept all the friends in a state of enkindlement and activity. When he passed away from this life, the fire was extinguished and there was no one in his place to keep the wheels rolling.

Speaking about the journey of Baha-Ullah from Baghdad to Constantinople he said: "There were 60 stages from Baghdad to Samson and the trip was made under the most difficult circumstances. It was a time of famine and scarcity of food. We had beside, more than 70 people in the party and nearly 30 horses and other animals. These horses had to be fed and as it was most difficult for others to feed straw, grass, barley for the animals and food for the men, I appointed myself at the head of commissions department. As soon as we reached <20> the end of one stage, I would go all alone in the villages and amongst the wild tribes of <unreadable> and with the greatest amount of persuasion, I would make them sell me the necessary provisions for horses and men. I always first thought about the feed for the animals. Once they were provided I would think of the men. With gold in hand, often I was refused provision. They would tell me roughly: We do not have straw or barley! I would answer: Are we not your guests passing through your country and has not the prophet said: 'Be ye kind to your guest even though he be an infidel.' They would then frown and say: We will not sell you anything. I answer: All right. Then, give them to me, gratis!

Often from afternoon till midnight {{p21}} I was going from one village to another trying to find food and provision and on my return, I was so tired that I could not stand on my feet. then I had to supervise the division of the provision for the animals so that no one may take more than his share. By this time I was so tired that I would go to sleep without eating anything. The Blessed Perfection travelled in "Kajave" but we had a horse for him  and sometimes, he would ride. From Baghdad to the first stage he was on horseback while in Acca, we had a wonderful white donkey which belonged to him. The name of the donkey was "Barg" lightning. When we arrived at "Kharout" whose present name is "Mamouratol-Aziz," I was at {{p22}} a loss how to get food and provision when I saw a gentleman coming toward me and behind him there were many labourers carrying loads on their shoulders. He said: Ezzah Pasha has offered thee presents for Baha-Ullah and humbly prays him to accept them. The presents consisted of barley, straw, forage, rice, sugar, bread, tea, butter, etc., a large quantity of each. For the first time after many nights and days of worry I felt relieved. I asked one of the believers to look over the delivery of these goods, thanked the gentleman and went straight to sleep. I slept all that afternoon, all that night and all the next morning till noon. We stayed 8 days in "Kaspout" and I did hardly anything else but sleeping because we had everything supplied.

Hello Harriet! The public meeting last night in Burger Museum was assuredly the largest Bahai meeting were held in Germany. There were present at least 1500 present of the most representative element on Stuttgart and the talk of the Master enkindled their hearts with the Fire of the Love of God. He talked on Universal Peace and Universal Love. Many eyes were weeping. When he wanted to leave, around his automobile hundreds of men and women were gathered, giving him a most enthusiastic farewell. It was a wonderful night and its influence in the future will be very great.

Dear Harriet!

The love of the German believers for the Master is the most remarkable thing I have ever witnessed anywhere. This love is shown toward him even by their children. Their sturdiest and strongest men have the greatest respect and veneration for him. As they enter his room, it is as though they are in the Presence of the Superior Being. Everyone kisses his hand and keeps silent, ever eager to listen to his words of wisdom and knowledge. The kissing of his hands is the most natural and spontaneous thing you have ever witnessed. No one has told them to do this and the Master discourages them but it springs from their hearts. It is the most interesting sight to see children of a very few years running to him with love and then kissing his hand. His love for the children is a source of never {{p2}} failing joy to all those who come to see him which immediately put them in touch with his all-prevailing spirit of kindness and tenderness. For the last month or two the great prophecy of Isaiah often comes to my mind: For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and His name called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, and The Prince of Peace. I do not claim that the Master is the fulfilment of this prophecy but I can say thus much safely that all these qualities are found in hi to perfection. Anyone who is endowed with the spiritual perception and stays one morning in his Presence and sees with his own eyes all that occur, he becomes convinced of this statement. One does not need to go out to see the world; the world comes to him with all its puzzling problems. All types of men and women sit at his feet and in {{p3}} his heavenly environment all their seemingly insurmountable barriers are wiped away and they become as one. He carries them away into the empyrean realm of brotherhood and while living there, these people who were total strangers to each other - lo and behold they have become brothers! What made this sudden transformation possible? The Universal Consciousness of the Master with the magic wand of spirit, he unfolds before our vision, the glories of human solidarity but often the light being too dazzling we turn away from it, preferring our dim ray of patriotism. He teaches his audience, he amuses them, he instructs them, he inspires their hearts with noble ideals, he fires their spirit with enthusiasm for greater faith, he counsels them, he guides them through the rocky paths {{p4}} of life, he gives them sound advice regarding their affairs, he confers upon them happiness, he improves their minds, and he exalts their thoughts. In deed and word, he is the Great Ensample of divine Humanity. We must plan our imperfect lives after his Perfect example, the lesser must revolve around the Greater, the port must follow the whale, and the drop must emulate the ocean. The infinite possibilities of progress are before us, the trumpet has sounded the Great Call, the mighty rivers of knowledge are flowing, the Breeze of the holy Spirit is wafted, the doors of the rose-garden of Abha are open, the heavenly banquet is spread, the divine Beloved has unveiled his face and the day of the spiritual brotherhood is close at hand. Now what our effort and our endeavor might accomplish remain to be seen!

{{p5}}

This morning before the friends started to come he told us something about the life of Bismarck: He was the most wonderful genius i statesmanship. He was a wise, shrewd and most intelligent diplomatist. First he conceived the plan of the confederation of the scattered German principalities into one great Empire and then for long many years he worked persistently for its realization till at last his labours were crowned with success. To accomplish such a great task of union was superhuman. Now all this German development and its modern culture owe its origin to the confederation. Notwithstanding all these services, all that is left of him is a name in history and statues erected in his memory here and there. But if he had served one thousandths {{p6}} part, the Cause of God, eternally he would have shown forth from the boryan of everlasting glory.

Then the believers started to come. Mr and Mrs Hofner brought their son who is a favourite of Our Beloved. Having not enough seats, many of the friends were standing all around the room. The Master took the little boy in his arms, kissed him, played with his locks and while he was nestled in his lap he spoke: The love of the children is pure; therefore you can see it in their faces. All of us must have loved; especially this love, because it is the Love of God. Our hearts must be like the hearts of the children which are without deceit or dust. The susceptibilities of the children rule over their wills. If the children do not love some {{p7}} one they do not approach him. Of double-dealing, they know nothing. They are nor hypocritical. Their outward and inward are the same. Children must be well-educated. These children are like unto the tender plants. If the plant is trained straight by the skilful gardener it will become straight and if it is trained crookedly, it will become crooked. From babyhood, the Love of God must be deposited in their hearts. They will, then, be well educated, they will become illumined, and they will be imbued with praiseworthy qualities. I love the children very much, because they are of the Kingdom of God. I hope that all these children may attain to the stage if fruition because they are Bahai children.

{{p8}}

Then he got up from his chair and divided the any bouquets of flowers amongst the friends. Reaching Mr Rouff he stroked his face and gave him more flowers than the rest. "Because thou art my "baby", therefore thy shore is larger," he said and from that time Mr Rouff is proudly - "although I suppose 50 years - nicknamed "Abdul Baha's baby." "Although in age thou art old, yet in spirit thou art young, the Master remarked with one tap on his shoulder and everybody was laughing with the keen humor of the King of Kings.

Another group of the friends were admitted into his Presence. He said: Affairs so shaped themselves that I may stay longer in this city.

{{p9}} 

In this there lies a consummate wisdom. It will become evident in the future. There is no doubt that the believers of Stuttgart have ability and capability. Although I got the call, yet you are the ones to be profited by it. Your sincerity in the cause has caused these delays in my departure. When I leave this city I even anticipate receiving good news from you. I hope to get the glad-tidings that you ate enkindled with the fire of the Love of God, day unto day ye are advancing along ideal paths. Whenever the heat of the Sun is diffused and the rain pours down. Then the tree shall grow and develop. Likewise may you grow and develop through the divine Bestowal and {{p10}} exercise toward each other the utmost of affecting and love.

To another group he gave a long talk about the Crown of Everlasting Glory which Baha-Ullah has prepared for all his friends, how this station is not appreciated today just as they did not appreciate Christ and his Teachings. "I give you the glad-tidings," he said towards the end, "that ye are accepted at the Threshold of God and the doors of the Kingdom of Abha are open before your faces. Ere long ye shall observe the traces of this promise I shall never forget Stuttgart; for in this city I inhale the fragrances of spirituality..."

There was a man in the audience who had very long moustaches. {{p11}} He was the father of Mrs Herrigel. The Master looking at his moustaches said jokingly: You are like a lion. People may become afraid of you. Lions are of two kind. The lion of the jungle and the lion of God. The former takes life, the latter confers life. Now thou art the lion of God. Both lions are courageous. The courage of one comes from the brute force, the courage of the other from heart. He is not afraid of any danger; in the field of self-sacrifice he is ready to give up his life. This is real heroism. The "lion of God", Mrs Herrigel's father said was now a Bahai and he could testify that these teachings have entirely transformed him.

{{p12}}

The Master said: And so it must be, otherwise a person is not a Bahai. It will be only the change of a name and not that of identity. There were many souls in the East who have been formerly weak, vicious, tyrannical, and dark but having become Bahais now they as strong, sanctified, just and luminous.

A Bahai father and mother with their three little radiant boys came in. The Beloved called them to himself and gave those fruits and candy. He said: "How I love these children! How pure and innocent they are! They are the embodiments of light. Look at their blue eyes, how beautiful they are! How lovely their looks! Oh! How I love them!

{{p13}}

Till 12 o'clock the room was filled with emptied group after group. Consul Schwarz, with his daughter was waiting for a one hour to take the Master for a ride. At last we were free and ready to start out when another group arrived and for a few minutes the Master entertained them. Many of the friends brought their German Hidden words and Abdul Baha's photos for him to sign. Miss Olly Schwarz, the daughter of Consul had her book brought for the Beloved to write something and he wrote the following beautiful prayer:

"O Thou Beauty of Abha! Make {{p14}} Thou this maid-servant of Thy Threshold a radiant lamp so that like unto a star she may shine with the Light of Thy Love."

We had more than one hour drive though the royal Park called the "Solitude". There were many old trees, lovely lakes, and innumerable deers. On our return the Consul was showing the Master the palace belonging to a Barou. "This is the best private residence in Stuttgart," he said. "No," the Master answered immediately, "The best private residence in Stuttgart is your, because we have been there and have raised the mention of God."

Again Consul Schwarz expatiating on the antiquity of a noble family the Master answered, "The noble family will be the one which you will found, because you are a believer in Baha-Ullah." The Consul also showed us the "Bismarck Tower" high on a hill, having a commanding view over all the city. On the 21st of June every year, during the night a great fire is lighted on this tower in commemoration of the Confederation of German Empire. On the way the Master called at the office of Doctor Fisher, stayed there for a few minutes and as we were all invited for lunch to the Consul's house we were taken to 3 Alexanderstrasse. Here the Master rested for a while before lunch and then told <unreadable> Consul the lovely story of the "thorn-seller" of Baghdad who invited him to his tent 20 miles outside of the city. The dinner consisted of baked dough and dates but the delicious tastes of it has yet remained {{p16}}  in his palate because he had cooked it with love. At four o'clock many prominent men and women of the royal Court of the King of Wurttemberg were invited to meet the Master. Happily they all understood English and the address of the Master could be made more interesting to them. Many of them were Counts and Countesses, Barous and Baronesses and of the cabinet of the King. It was a very significant meeting and the result of it will be far-reaching for the Cause in Germany. The Consul and his wife were very glad because they were enabled to bring about such a brilliant gathering. They were without exception most attracted to the Master's address. Which the Beloved was speaking in Consul's young son cause to have him sat in his lap. Some photos were {{p17}} taken of that natural position. At five o'clock the beloved motored to Fraven club, Kouzleistr to deliver an address before the Bahais at their 19 days Feast. Four rooms were thrown open to each other and in all of them many tables were arranged over which candies, flowers, fruits, etc. were served. As this feast was decided upon only yesterday, all the Bahais did not know about it. There were more than 150 present. The Master gave an eloquent address which imparted happiness to the hearts. Amongst those who were invited {{p18}} there were many important men and women in the social life of Stuttgart. After this meeting the Beloved came to the hotel. In the evening Consul Schwarz came and begged him to decide upon a date so that the they could have another public gathering. This time the meeting to be held in a larger hall. He, however, could not accept this kind of invitation because he expected to leave for Paris. Beside he must rest two days before leaving the city. Consequently he hoped they will excuse him. We have had already many heavenly meetings, the seeds have been sown, now the friends must arise to water them.

Ahmad.



###April 28,1913 Hote Marquardt, Stuttgart

{{p1}}

I think Stuttgart will keep the Master three days longer. As he has received many cablegram from Haifa that pilgrims from all parts of the Orient have arrived and are awaiting his return, he is trying to make all the possible haste to bring the Western journey to a close. When we left America no one ever dreamed that his European tour will run into so many months; but the unexpected happened and many parts of Europe were illumined with this light and many people were awakened to the importance of these teachings. Consciously or unconsciously, by word or by deed, they testify that this Cause is the spirit of this age the light of this age and the hope of this age.

{{p2}}

This morning quite naturally Master talked to us three servants of his, for nearly one hour. There was no one else in the room. When he talks only to a few people, his charm and attraction as a divine conversationalist becomes more manifest and evident. His knowledge and varied human experiences, as he goes on talking keep one hanging to every word which drops from his blessed tongue and one is never tired to listen to him. His most heavenly talks are always seasoned with a touching human story or a sweet demonstration of love towards the children or humorous remarks about someone in the audience or the stroking of the beard of a friend or slapping gently on the cheek of another. Thus the people are immediately put in touch with his divine spirit of love and affection. They feel the beauty of his humanity and divinity at the same time.

{{p3}}

Opening his remarks as he sat on the chair he said:- If we could appreciate more the bounties of this age and the marvels of this century we would be more thankful to God than ever. For example, let us take this room. Cyrus the great King of Persia could not enjoy the luxuries of a room like this. Solomon with all his glories did not have a mirror like this! (and he pushed me jokingly before the mirror and said: look into it!) Solomon had not an automobile but only a wooden chariot a little gilded though. The audience chamber of Alexander the great was not lighted with electricity. Now most everybody enjoys the possession of an automobile or his room is lighted with electricity. Haroun-Er-Rashid who ruled over many countries of the East had not a clock like this one in his room. The first clock was made during his reign {{p4}} and it was such a novely that he ordered another one to be made and sent as a great gift to Charlemagne the Great. When it was presented to him all the people were astonished that it worked automatically. The priests of the Court stood before it wonder-struck and could not explain to themselves, the secret power which made it work. Finally after much reflection and consultation the decided that the Arab machinist has imprisoned the devil within the clock and it was the devil that make it work. Thus they unloosed the various instruments of the clock and found nothing in it neither could they put them together. In those days one could not find a piece of paper to write on, but if someone could get a page of papyrus or skin he would consider himself very fortunate all the verses of the Khoran were written on the shoulders of the muttons {{p5}} and palm leaves. God has opened the doors of inconceivable bounties to the people of this age but many are thoughtless and never think to thank the Maker. Stranger than all the rest is that while God has showered His infinite blessings upon the people of this century. Yet there are some so-called materialist who go to the point of denying His existence. God is very patient but even the patience of God has a limit. What wonderful gifts this age offers to the children of man! Like unto these flowers their fragrances are diffused to all parts of the world. Formerly they had houses built of mud, wood, reed and rough stone but the house of every well-lodo man today is better equipped than the palaces of {{p6}} of the Kings of ancient time. Consider how the world has advanced that today this one room has more modern conveniences than the great Hall of Cyrus in Persepolis. When I was in Bagdad I was invited to the palace of Egbaled Doulet. He was an Indian Novvab, very wealthy and rich. He had many palaces in different parts of the Orient and would travel all the year around. While going through his palace and decorated Halls I told him that his palace was more wonderful than the palace of Cyrus. He said:'I must then be greater than Cyrus." I answered you are not as great as Cyrus but you enjoy more modern conveniences than ever Cyrus did. One evening he stayed in his palace. After dinner we went to sleep. At midnight {{p7}} I got up as usual, we went out, made ablution and came in the room and engaged my time in prayer and supplication toward God with the utmost joy and fragrance. Suddenly I heard Egbaled Doulet crying like a child and sobbing loudly. I went to him and asked what was it Novvab? Why art thou crying. Why this weeping? He said 'Oh! nothing! I answered:' But there must be a reason for it! You are not crying without any cause. Tell me the cause and I may atleast console you, 'No!' he rejoined 'you cannot console me! I am faithless but you are faithful. You have belief in God but I have lost all my belief. I took a trip to Europe. I carried in its great capitals and my conversations with the westerners made me an unbeliever. But this evening {{p8}} I observed with what radiant hope what heavenly spirituality, what strong faith, what divine assurance you were  praying to God. I envied you! I wished I could give away all my wealth and get one grain of your faith. I know I am going to die after a few days or years and it is the greatest mortification of my life to think that I will leave this world without the radiance of hope and faith in my heart! I told him :"Well let us talk it together. Let me give you an exposition of divine philosophy! He said 'No! There is no use, you cannot put any faith in my heart. I wish I was as poor as the beggar in the street and had the faith you have. What can I do with all this money!

This Novvab was extremely wealthy. In his palace he had many rooms and in each room he had piled sacks of money belonging to various nationalities.

{{p9}}

His library contained the richest collection of books and rare manuscripts. One room contained the precious stones, diamonds, rubies, turquoise, amethyst, etc. Once the English Consul wanted to bring 700 mules and did not have any ready cash. He came to the Novvab and borrowed the amount. The money was weighed in sacks. He had been to Persia, was presented to the Shah and had no favorable opinion of him. He told us many stories about hi, and his rule in India. He told us the story of another Indian, a philosopher and a thinker but a poor man who lived at the same time in Bagdad. He was perfectly contented with his lot and never complained. He believed this world was a theater and in it he was a spectator. Whenever  we asked him what art thou doing he would {{p10}} answer, I am watching one of the scenes of the play. After we found him in deep contemplation. "What art thou doing now?"  There is an intermission so I am thinking over the situation of what I have just seen! Someone inquired of him what is your opinion about the Westerners? He answered. These people are parts of their machinery. Just as the machinery is constantly working in a factory automatically without knowing why or wherefore, so these people are working. The machinery is oiled once in a day to run smoothly. These westerners are oiled three times a day! Another person asked him, what do you think of the Eastern and western nations? He rejoined. They are all laborers some are working, others are out of work. Some are busy, others are lazy, but all of them are plain workmen!

{{p11}}

This Hindu Saheb was much attracted to Baha Ullah. They asked him "what do you think about Baha Ullah?" He answered: 'He is the greatest of the world of humanity. He is peerless. He is beyond my limited knowledge. I cannot describe him. Do you want any miracle? His very existence is a miracle; his walking is a miracle his speaking is a miracle. I have seen many  people in this world. I have associated with the most important learned men of India and Europe. I have discussed problems of this with all of them but I have never been drawn to anyone. But no sooner I met this man I was attracted to him. All his deeds, his words and his conducts are standing miracles. Were you to observe carefully, you would realize no one can do {{p12}} exactly the same thing. This man was really free and detached. He had a small room. From the ceiling, many packages were hanging. These packages contain rice, beans, bread, etc. He cooked his own simple food and then sitting in a corner he was drowned in a sea of reflection. He had the greatest power of concentration. For hours he would concentrate his thoughts upon one definite object. Finally he became a Bahai and went to India to teach this Cause. While there he was stricken down with a peculiar malady and his spirit ascended to the Kingdom of Abba."

Thus I can go on writing all the wonderful things he told us this morning and I have not written even half of them but this sample will show you what a glorious hour we had with him, all alone to ourselves.

{{p13}}

Right after our heavenly hour with the Master Mr Eugene Diebald and Miss Helen Wieland who are engaged come to the Beloved to receive his benediction. They are a fine, loving couple. He smiled at them, the smile of approval and joy. He said: "I have heard you are engaged to get married. It will be a blessed union. A marriage performed according to the religion of God will be very blessed. A young man cannot appreciate fully the blessings of marriage. When he grows older he will realized its supreme importance in life. When he sees that through the sacred bon of matrimony he has formed a beautiful family, he soars into the heaven of bliss, especially when he is laden with years. Marriage is the greatest fortress for the preservation of man's purity. It shall protect him from immoral deeds.

{{p14}}

It will be the means of his chastity and sanctity. In the estimation of God there are no greater attributes than chastity and sanctity. The greatest virtue of man is his chastity. The most wonderful Bestowed of God is sanctity. These time qualities are specialized in man. Their absence means animalism and the ascendency of brute passions. Therefore marriage in the estimation of God is very much beloved so that man and woman may live together in the utmost union of the soul and the highest degree of love and the purity of the family atmosphere. Whenever I see a man and wife love each other and are united together I am now made supremely happy. Therefore I hope you will live together with the sweetest affection and tenderest {{p15}} feelings and will form a blessed family with joy and happiness.

Then Mr. G. Wornle, an artist come and made a most life-like painting of the Master. This will be photographed and copies forwarded to America as soon as they are made ready.

By this time many friends had come in and were welcomed. His voice was not yet clear from cold so he spoke in his quiet undertone musical way. His eyes were shut all the time he was speaking. Now and then he would raise his right hand in the air with his blessed fingers far apart, or take off his turban and put it on again or stroke his beard. He said in part: "Your meeting yesterday afternoon was very good. I did not feel well but for your sake I come. The gathering of the believers is the assembly {{p16}} of the spiritual ones. The spirit of God descends upon  the assembly of the friends. They are the spiritual power-houses and confer bliss and jot. During the last days of his life. His Holiness Christ held one meeting for the apostles, and all of them sat around the same table. From that time it has been called the Lords supper, because they discussed subjects pertaining to the Kingdom of God. Therefore if a meeting is held, the general discussion of which is spiritual undoubtedly that meeting is godlike. Strive day and night that your assembly may become radiant and the hearts illumined. Consort with each other so that your spirits may be stirred into cheerfulness through the glad tidings of the Kingdom. If these conditions are fulfilled, rest assured that your assemblage is merciful; it is {{p17}} the cause of illumination of the world of humanity and it shall bestow everlasting life to all the people. I hope many such meetings willl be held in Stuttgart. Consider how many meetings have been held in the past. The results of none have been eternal except the meeting of his holiness Christ. Two thousand years have elapsed and yet its beneficent fruits are evident. Consequently the result of every divine meeting is eternal. Show ye an effort that become the meeting of the Kingdom. Whenever you desire to enter a Bahai meeting, first purify your hearts from all outside questions, put aside all the material or physical emotions, he ye in the utmost holiness and sanctification, he ye the channels for the {{p18}} love of God, then he ye occupied with the mention of the name of God, hearken to the heavenly words and advice of His Holiness Baha-ullah, deliver eloquent and inspiring addresses-so that ye may become abstracted from ought else same God, your spirits may take higher flights, the sphere of your thoughts may be widened, the spiritual susceptibility become predominant, the material emotions be entirely forgotten and all he submerged in the luminous sea od the Breaths of the Holy Spirit. I desire  this token for you. I hope you shall attain thereto.

He spoke about the marriage of Mr and Mrs Gregory very beautifully and of the meetings of the white and colored friends and of the great {{p19}} power of Baha-ullah and of the harmony which He has established amongst the races. He said in a reminiscent mood half tp himsel, half to us:- Truly I say those meetings in America were most marvellous meetings. They were strange and mystical eventsm colossal in their proportions and miraculous in their aspects. Later on the significance and result of those meetings will become manifest.

A blind believer was brought in and introduced. He was a man of elderly age. The master told him 'Praise be to God that thy insight is open and thou art witnessing the realities with the eyes of perception. Spiritual blindness is worse than material blindness. That is why Christ say: these people have eyes but they see not.

{{p20}}

Someone spoke Bahai. He said:-It will be very beneficial to the Cause if a tie of correspondence is established between the German and the American Bahais. Spiritual correspondence must be continues not for a month or two or a year or this and then dropped. Complete affection and amity must be established between them. This is very important.

A number of children were brought in all beautifully dressed. They had bouquet of flowers in their hands. Reverently they approached their Father and kissed his hand. To one of them he said: "I do not speak German but our hearts are one! The face of the little tot brightened up and gleefully cried out:"Don't I know it!" His mother told us he was crying all this {{p21}} morning because he hear the Master was going to  leave Stuttgart. There was another little girl of two years old who first cried and did not wanted to go to him but little by little with that divine patience of his he tamed her and after 10  minutes she was contentedly sitting in his lap and eating candy from his hands. "I have bribed her." he sai laughing. "In Turkey when you go to see a Pasha and you wish him to attend to your affairs quickly, you must give him some gifts. This is called "Bakhsheesh" to this little German Pasha." Her parent wanted to take her to him several times, but the Master said: let her be free. Don't interfere with her freedom. It was the greatest example of winning {{p22}} through the Power of love. He gathered all the children around himself, some sitting on his lap, others sitting before him on the floor, some standing on his right and left and all smiling; their hats filled with candies, oranges and bananas. The master was also very happy. It was one of the most beautiful pictures of his divine fatherhood. Now and then he stroked their heads or kissed their cheeks or hugged them close to his breasts. "I am going to put you in my trunk and take you to Syria. Will you come?" he said to one. "Of course!" the child answered, his eyes dancing with joy. I will buy you a pony he said to another. You can play with the lovely children on Mount Carmel he addressed a third.

{{p23}}

Then the Beloved spoke:-From amongst these children, blessed souls shall arise. These children must be instructed in the wisdom of reality; they must be given divine education. The plants which are trained by the hand of the gardener have a different growth and development. The system education must be so thorough that day unto day their intelligences may increase, their minds be developed and their spin trial emotions become keener. The education of the children must began from early childhood, not by cramping their head with dead formulas and historical datas which they cannot understand. This is a mistake. The elements of sciences , oils, crafts, etc must be taught to them through object lessons, as though they are {{p24}} playing and amusing themselves. With sunshine, with music, with happiness they must learn these things. There should be no suggestion of hard study but all their studies. Again, the children must be encouraged to convey their thoughts in simple, direct words. The teachers must speak with them intelligently and respectfully as though they speak with grown-up people. Everything must be explained to them in the most, fascinating, simple language. In turn, they must let the children speak those things they learn, amongst themselves, ask questions from each other and the one who gives the best answer receive a reward so that others {{p25}} may emulate him. For example one child may ask questions quite informally from another on geography, mathematics, etc and the other may answer. These simple questions and answers must be learnt by heart and as the Knowledge of the students increase in any branch of learning their questions may be spontaneous. Similarly all the divine questions must be taught ti the children in questions and answers. With happiness, joy and delight they must learn these things, The abstruse and spiritual subjects must be put in as simple language as possible.

To another group of believers he said:- We are very happy here because the Power of Baha-ullah has gathered us together {{p26}} although our countries are wide apart from each other yet we are closer together than relatives. Although the sun is far away from the earth yet its rays are shining upon it. Although Germany is remote from  Persia yet the lights of the Orient have illumined it. That is why Christ says; the children of the Kingdom  shall go out and people from the four corners of the earth shall enter. Now although the inhabitants of Persia are from the land wherein the Blessed Perfection appeared, yet many of them are heedless. But you who are far from Persia have taken a share from the Bestowels of Baha-ullah. You who were remote, thousands of miles became near and those who were near to him remained far away. This is through the pure mercy of God. Thank ye God that ye have attained {{p27}} thereunto. I hope that day unto day you may be drawn neared to the Kingdom of Baha-ullah, he enkindled more with the Fire of the Love of God, receive a good portion from the Breaths of the Holy Spirit and day unto day, may you be more imbued unto the virtues of the humankind. I shall beg of God for you invisible Confirmations.


Afterward a minister of the Church was presented to the Master who received a wonderful confirmation and went away inspired with the word of the Beloved. At 12 o'clock Dr Kahlhas called on the Master, examined his chest and advised him not to go out for the next few days and not speak much. These suggestions were timely and the believers obeyed the Doctor's orders in going away earlier today. 

{{p28}}


In the afternoon he was quiet without but toward the evening several friends called and received refreshing words from the garden of his knowledge. Mr and Mrs Kerrigel prepare his food in their home and bring it to the hotel. They are so happy the master has given them this service.

Ahmad

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Compared with the activities and the coming and going of the friends for the last few days this was a quiet one. Many anxious believers called with nosegays of flowers inquiring after the health of the Beloved and most of them were permitted to shake hand with him while lying on the couch but there were no exclusive talks except toward the evening when he felt better. The injunction of the Doctor has been followed as closely as possible and the effect was noticeable.

I was surprised when I observed most of the friends congratulating and offering me flowers and gifts. At first I thought it was a joke but afterwards I realized someone had given them a hint that this was my birthday. Of course this was not my birthday and we had a very amusing time of it. Miss {{p2}} Anna Kosthin and Mrs. Schweizer and Miss Turner have given me a watch; Mr. Herrigel the chain, someone else a book of the views of the city and many bouquets of roses, carnations, sweet-peas. When they offered me the flowers, I thought of course they were for the Master. "No! They are for you! They are your birthday presents!" I was never able to find out who played this joke on me. If you were in my place what would you have done?

In the afternoon Mrs. Ekstein called and the Beloved talked with her on the progress of the Cause in Stuttgart: Your husband he said, is firm and sincere in the Cause and assuredly he shall be confirmed in spreading the glad-tidings of the Kingdom. He is an active Bahai. In this Cause there are two kinds of Bahais. The first kind is active and speaking; the second is inactive and {{p3}} silent. These two although Bahais, yet they are wildly different from each other. The former is more beloved than the latter. The body has two hands, one is active, the other paralyzed. Which one do you prefer?

The Minister who called on him yesterday come again today. The Master said: Ordained ministers are many, confirmed ministers are few. During the day of Christ there were many Rabbis and high-priests but none of them was confirmed except Paul. All of them were deprived but he became the confirmed King of the ministers. I hope that thou mayst become like Paul, receive a goodly portion from the heavenly Bestowals and arise in the service of thy fellowmen. Do not look upon thyself and thine own capacity. When man is abstracted from the conditions of this earth {{p4}}, release from the fetters of the world of nature and quickened through the Breaths of the Holy Spirit - he shall become very much confirmed, and the divine powers shall encircle him; to such an extent that he shall become himself astonished. Therefore, turn thy attention unto God! Look upon the infinite Bounties of God. Do not look upon thine own incapability. Although the earth is composed of the black sail, yet through the downpour of rain and the heat of the sun, flowers and anemones shall grow therefrom. This Minister has written a good article on the Bahai Cause which will appear in a Protestant German magazine for the month of May.

Mr. Schweizer called. He and his wife are two of the lovely Bahais we have here. {{p5}} They are so devoted to the Master and so enkindled with the fire of the Love of God! He is a government surveyor and for six months in the year he is called away from home. The Master was in bed and he made him sit beside himself and brought his head close to his breast and kissed him several times. He told him: In thy face I see great capacity. I give thee the promise that if thou shalt arise to spread the message of the Kingdom, thou shall become marvellously confirmed. He answered: I hope I will become a teacher in deed as well as in word. Very true, the Master said, if a person does not practice what he teaches, his words will have no effect. A person who calls himself a Bahai and does not try to live in accord with {{p6}} the Teachings he is like the man who on one hand invites all men to Peace and Conciliation and on the other cuts the heads of innocent people. The Manifestation of Baha-wllah was for the appearance of Deeds. Therefore I hope that you may be assisted to teach both with Deeds and Words. Read the hidden words and practice accordingly.

Mr. Schweizer is translating the book of the Brilliant Proof by Mirza Abul Fazl the Master said: This Mirza Abul Fazl whose book you are translating is a man who teaches the Cause by deeds and by words. His trip to America was a blessed one! His station is greater even than the apostles. He is the sincere servant of the Cause. He has {{p7}} sacrificed everything for the sake of the Cause. He does not rest for one moment. He either teaches the Cause or compiles books or travels around. I love him very much.

Fran and Frauline Consul called to inquire about the health of the Beloved. In the course of conversation he said: Complete physical health is to be enjoyed by the animals. Consider when the animal possesses perfect health, it brays, it rolls on the grass, it grazes in the meadows, it dances and kicks and it does perform all kinds of prank. But man may enjoy the completest physical health, live in the palace and be surrounded with all the luxuries of modern civilization, yet he may not feel happy, mental anxieties attack him, spiritual worries encircle him, he {{p8}} weeps, laments and stalks a broad ghost-like. This in itself shows that man must take greater care of his spiritual health. Again a person may be sick, lying in bed a piece of good news is brought to him suddenly he is revived and often he is healed. The happiness of man is through his spiritual health and not bodily health. My spirit is always healthy, therefore I am always happy. You must likewise strive again this spiritual health and happiness and thank ye God that ye are living in the age of the Blessed Perfection; ye have heard his resounding call; ye are awakened from the slumber of negligence, ye have attained to the most great bounty and ye have obtained eternal life. If ye had given the treasures of the whole world, {{p9}} ye could not obtained this most great bounty. Consider that Mr. Morgan, the American multi-millionaire died and left behind his wealth but ye shall never die, ye are always living in the Kingdom of Abha and the traces of your faith and assurance shall ever live.

Afterward Consul Schwarz and Doctor Faber arrived. They asked many questions in regard to the possibility of a European war over Sentow and the Master like a true physician diagnosed for them the malady. The greatest need of Europe, he said, is the organization of a European Congress in which the delegates of various Powers may discuss seriously the possibility of immediate, concurrent {{p10}} disarmament but they do not listen to any advice. Thirty years ago I wrote to Sultan Abdul Hamid that if he desired to protect his Empire, he must give ample equality and freedom of rights to all his subjects no matter to what religion they may belong and establish a constitution but he did not listen and you see today the results. Many other wonderful remarks were made by the Master about the triple alliance, Triple Eutenle and the disturbance of the Balance of Power in Europe that I have no time to write but they all showed his omniscient knowledge.



### HOTEL MARQUARDT STUTTGART April 30, 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

This is the last day of the mouth and the last day of our stay in Stuttgart. Tomorrow morning 10:53 we will leave for Paris, arriving there, about 9 o'clock pm. The enforced rest of the last two days has improved the Master's health and the Doctor told us that he can leave easily tomorrow. We left Paris the first of April and we are returning the first of May. In this one mouth many events were chronicled and the Cause was promoted through three other European countries, Germany, Austria and Hungary. What a wonderful month! Like a glorious vision it <2> passed away never to be repeated! I can never explain in words the inner, spiritual experiences of these days. They were days printed upon the page of memory with the ink of gold. I have witnessed the Victory of our King of Kings on every occasion and the love and reverence shower to him both by strangers and friends are the greatest proofs of his power. We will enter Paris with glad hearts, because this trip has been more successful than we ever could conceive! The Master is also very happy, because the Call of the Kingdom was raised, the Fragrance of the rays of the Sun of Reality spread. What greater joy do we need? What more perfect beatitude do we long for?

{{p3}}

This morning the Beloved felt much better, his throat being cleaner. Mr. Herrigel Causul Schwaz, Mr. Reiff and several other friends were the early callers to inquire about his health. About half past nine a group of the believers had gathered in his Presence and he addressed the themes: Having arrived in Stuttgart we have become your guest. We have the greatest attachment for you. We are striving that perchance the East and the West, God willing, may become unified. My western trip was an introduction to this long, sought consummation. This is the beginning of the dawn. I hope the lights of oneness may >4> shine upon all the regions. The people of the world are like unto the drops and when these drops are gathered together, they will form a great sea. I hope that all of them may become united and conjoined, them the sea of the oneness of the world of humanity shall warm gloriously. The inhabitants of the world are like unto the sheep but they are scattered; we hope to gather these dispersed sheep into one flock and shepherd them under the divine training of the Ideal Shepherd; so they may find comfort and rest in the verdant meadow of Everlasting happiness and drink from the {{p5}} the fountain of eternal life. This is my aim in life. What do you say? Does it agree with yours or does it conflict? These sheep of God are very much dispersed. They are scattered over the rocky mountains, down in the valleys of darkness, over the burning Sahara and are constantly surrounded by the blood- thirsty wales. How wonderful will it be if they could be brought together in this green Divine plain, live in the utmost joy and he protected and preserved by the compassionate Shephered! The demines of the world are like unto the children and the real Father is God. How sweet will it be if all these children could {{p6}} be brought under the Education of the heavenly Teacher and every one seek the instruction of the Kind Father!

All morning people continued to come and to everyone the Master delivered an address, each a little bright gem of the Spiritual Kingdom.

When Mrs. and Miss Schwarz arrived he asked them to bring there at 3 o'clock and take him out over the "green mountains" of Stuttgart for the last time.

About two o'clock the Master gave a "little talk" to a growth of ladies on the woman's rights. Herin it is reproduced: "In former times no one would have believed that woman shall arise and demand equal rights and suffrage.

{{p7}}


Now in America the women have received suffrage in member of states and their cause is marching on. One of the meaning of the prophecy in the old Testament that the lion and the deer shall graze together in one meadow is that men and women shall be equal and have the same rights. For example Doctor Faber who is so small will be equal! This remark made everybody laugh and for more than half an hour the Beloved kept them in constant room of laughter by telling them a number of amusing militant stories of the English suffragettes.

{{p8}}

At three o'clock many Bahais came and were sad to hear the Master was going to leave tomorrow. He told them: Consider what wonderful love is this that has been established between us through the Power of His Holiness Baha-ullah! The Shah of Persia came twice ro Stuttgart. Although he was a royal King he did not find one real, heartfelt friend. The utmost was this that the government received him officially according to its long-established custom just as it would have received any other royal Personage. But we who were Prisoner for 40 yrs have cause here and have found so many heartfelt, cordial friends whose love and affection are lasting and not temporary. Therefore it is made clear to you {{p9}} that this love and amity have been brought into being through an extraordinary power; otherwise it would have been impossible for our hearts to be so cemented together; while from a worldly stand point, the King of Persia must have been the object of love and estimation. The holy divine Manifestation of God through whom this nighty and potent power appears are the very quintessence's of existence and the plain people who follow their Teachings are greater than the Kings and queens of the earth. Reflect what the Power of the Kingdom of {{p10}} Abha has accomplished! Its rays are shining upon the hearts! Its Bestowals have established communication between the spirits; Its principles have ushered in a new era of spiritual brotherhood! Ere long ye shall observe that the splendors of the Kingdom of Abha have illumined the East and the West! Then he lovingly distributed fruits and bonbons amongst the children. There was a young musician who has just become interested in the Cause and the Beloved before bidding them alien addressed him thus: Music is a sign of the signs {{p11}} of God. Just as the earthy music bestows exhilaration and rejoicing to the bodies so the spiritual music stirs into cheerfulness and beatific bliss the hearts and the spirits. The prophets of God are the heavenly Artists or Musicians. Therefore, I hope that whenever you are playing upon your instrument, you may hear the invisible song of the Kingdom and the divine anthem. Just as the material, martial music stirs the hearts of the warriors, may your ethereal music inspire the spirits of the warriors of Peace and salvation!

{{p12}}

The Beloved came down and with Fraw and Frauline Causul and the two little souls and myself and we started on drink for the lastle Beben housen. We passed through wonderful royal woods all verdant. Hills and mountains were in their gala dresses and the Master enjoyed a two hours continual drive through the most beautiful, divine country, the like of which nature seldom produce anywhere else. On the way he stopped at the village called Steinenbronn. He came down from the car and distributed money {{p13}} and candies amongst a few children and started to walk through the streets. Immediately the rumor was spread that the :King of the East" has come and more than one hundred children were after the Master. He gave me some money and I changed it i a nearly store and he asked we to distribute it amongst them. I ordered them to form a long line and put  a piece of money in the hand of each. When I finished my pleasant "job" the Master told me: you bow now mustered an army and you can fight against any Power! 

Arriving at Bebenhouson {{p14}} he walked through the castle. It is a hunting castle of the King and Queen who come during the summer to hunt in the woods. Formerly its has been a monastery but now it is transformed into a royal castle. It has a fine church which dates back to 12th country. The Master walked through the rooms and there we saw a chess box with which Napoleon the Great had played with the King. Contrary to his custom the Beloved wrote a line of poetry in the guest book, a rough translation of which is as follow: {{p15}} "The Imperial Court is empty because I do not see the royal face of the King. The verdant meadow is chagrined because it is not adorned with the stately stature of the Queen."

The car which brought the rest of our company had three accidents an its way to the Castle and they had to telephone to the city for another one. While they were in the country waiting for the arrival of the new car, Sayad assadullah had a good sleep on the grass.

In the car the Master said to Fran and Frauline Consul: Praise be {{p16}} to God that I have come to Stuttgart and summoned the people to the Kingdom of Abha. I am pleased that God has assisted me.Now, that noble souls like unto you have heard the Call of the Kingdom, you must arise with enthusiasm and courage to teach and spread the Glad. I have the utmost confidence in you and ever expect to received good news from you. After me raise your voice and cry out in the name of Abha {{p17}} and suffer the people to enter the Kingdom of God. My heart is with you. My spirit is with you. I must now go. I have accomplished my work. I will be always with you. In reality Stuttgart has the Capability of becoming the Center of the Glorious Cause in Europe.

We reached at the hotel about 8 o'clock. Many of the friends were waiting at the door and greeted the Master as he entered. Several were called into his Presence and spoke with them.

Mr. and Mrs. Werrigel brought {{p18}} suffer for all of us because we did not have tune to go out. Really, these two souls have served the Cause most wonderfully. My close association with Mr. Herrigel during the past month has made us to love him than even more.

Good bye to Stuttgart! We take way with us tomorrow the love and affection of all the believers of God!

Greetings Mr. and Mrs. Herrigel




### BALTIMORE HOTEL 88 BIS,AVENUE KLEBER May 1st 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

We are again back in Paris and pleasantly quartered in a lovely apartment in Baltimore Hotel Suit 35-37, one address is 88 ave. Klebar. Baltimore is certainly American and so I feel as though I am on "home soil." The trip from Stuttgart to Paris was made quit. The Master was in the first and we were in the second class. I do not see much difference between the first and second class except that the velvet of the first class is red and that of the second class yellow-brown; the compartment in the first class has four seats in the second class six seats and then there is a door dividing the coach into two halves. That is all. The Master was alone in his compartment and we had two gentleman, a German and a young travelling American. With the first {{p2}} we could not speak but the second, a clear-cut American of probably 28yrs old attracted my attention. His name is H.E. warneke of 9 East 37st New York City. He buys China and bronze statues from European factories for a large china wares store on 5th ave near 37th st. I spoke with him about the Cause and the Master. He become very much interested and I gave him Mr. Roy Wilhelms address so that on his return he may be get in touch with the friends of God. He had never heard the Bahai name, although he was in Newyork last April on the arrival of the Master. Having found many things in common we talked till 5pm. I went and told the Master about him and he called him into his Presence. Of course the first topic of discussion was America. The American people, the Master said are not satisfied with their present day civilization. It is true that {{p3}} they have built a marvelous civilization of their own through giant-like forces and energy which in many respects is bigger to that of the European civilization, yet they are striving for higher things, nobler ideals and universal principles. Look at the majority of the French people! How complacently satisfied they are! They think they have reached the highest aim of civilization and there is no higher step to take. But with the Americans it is different. They may be proud of their civilization, because they have made the dessert blossom like unto the rose, but they are not satisfied with it, they are seeking after new solutions of old and modern problems, they are thirsty for salubrious water, they are hungry for the bread of life, they are investigating the reality of everything. Their {{p4}} hearts are open, their minds receptive and in discussion never overbearing. They believe there is always a place on the top and so they go forward and upward. They never look backward or downward. They say, what we have accomplished in the past may be "all right", but we are going to do "the good" and after that, there is "the better" and then "the best" and is there any end to the infinite degrees of the "best"; For every "best" is followed by another "best" which is "better" than the former "best". When you observe carefully you shall see that the economic prosperity of a community or a nation is maintained by reciprocity and co-operation. In the whole world, you do not find one man, no matter how varied in his accomplishments who can be sufficient unto himself. All that he can do is to contribute one thousand the share to the well-being of the nation. He studies for ten or 20 yrs and then he is able to co-operate with the other thousands of his fellowmen to make them happier. He supplies them with part of their {{p5}} needs and as a reciprocal action they supply him with all his needs. But on the other hand, take the example of the honey bee. The bee is an independent, self-sufficient member of the bee-community. In itself, it is the source of supply and demand. It gives the sweet honey and it does not require anything in return. Similarly the little and is an individualist and can live and support itself standpoint the bee and the ant must be, then very happy and enjoy all the privileges of greatness, because they are self-satisfied. However, the glory of man is not in these things. Man becomes man through ideal virtues, through the excellences of the world of humanity, through intellectual superiority, through the Knowledge of God and the illumination of his heart!

{{p6}}

If he is imbued with these qualities, he is Man, otherwise he is lower than the animal." This was the gist of the Master's talk with our newly acquired American friend. As he is a patriot he was delighted to hear the Master praising so highly America and the American civilization. After this, accidentally we met two Zoroastrian ladies and a young man who have just arrived from Bombay and were on their way to London. The Master invited them to his compartment and gave them the glad-tidings of the rising of the sun of the new glory of Persia. Persia will advance very rapidly, he said," She will be crowned with her former glory and Phoenix-like she will spring up out of the ashes of shame and humiliation. You shall return to your beloved land and you will be respected by all the nations of the world. You will be honored and loved by everyone. Thirteen hundred years, you have wanderers over the face of the world. Now it is high time to go back and assist in the reconstruction of your country.

{{p7}}

I could see in their faces the light of gladness and joy. The Master showed them the photos taken in Stuttgart and they were extremely happy to Know that all these people, even the inhabitants of America do believe in the prophet hood of Zoroaster through the light of this Revelation. They will call on the Master while in Paris.

At 9:15 pm, the train entered the station-Garede l'Est-. The loving and luminous faces of Mors. and Madame Richard welcomed the Beloved and leaving the train he walked to the waiting room where a number of the friends prominent amongst them. Mrs. Alice Beede with a bouquet of white lilies and Mrs. Lilianthal, a boquet of roses greeted him, Mon.and Madame Scott, Mrs. Holly, Miss Sanderson, Mirja Jalal and {{p8}} several others clustered around the Beloved welcoming him back to Paris and expressing joy and pleasure over the spiritual victories he had won while on his heavenly mission. In a special automobile he was driven to this hotel. To Miss Sanderson and a friend of her he spoke briefly and then retired to his bed.

This morning long before 8 o'clock the Stuttgart friends started to come to bid farewell to the Beloved of the world. Amongst those who arrived very early, were Mr. and Mrs. Herrigel. Little by little a large number were gathered and were permitted to present themselves to the Beloved. Many eyes were weeping, many hearts were sad. The little Hefnen child was there and he was run to him and was in his arm. The Master playing   with his curly hair and kissing him now and then, his divine eyes emAnating the rays of love and compassion. While holding the child in his loving arms, he raised his voice, clear, resounding and beautiful: This is the day of farewell with you.

{{p10}}

Farewell is of two kinds. The first kind of farewell is followed by forgetfulness. This is the condition of the material souls. Some forget sooner, others later, but sooner or later, everyone forgets. The second kind of farewell is not followed by forgetfulness. This is the condition of the believers of Baha-ullah. Although from a physical standpoint, they may grow further and further from each other, yet in spirit, they are grown nearer and nearer and their longing for each other is increased. Their union is not followed by any separation. There are some of the believers whom I have not met for the last fifty years. These blessed souls are living in Persia and now I am in Europe, but day and night, I am with them. For example, I shall never forget this friend of mine (painting to the little boy in his arm and hugging him closer to his breast - thus causing laughter and genuine pleasure amongst all those who were present). The mother told the Master that she has been asking him to say every morning Allah Abha "so that Abdul Baha may get better but he said, :if I say it, then, he will feel well and leave us."

To the seconds group of the friends he said: "The darkness of materialism has enveloped Europe. Natural civilization has advanced tremendously and progress is magical and by baps and bounds but the spiritual Sun with all its glorious lights is set below the horizon. Perchance God willing, you may be the means of spreading divine illumination. Be ye hopeful in the Confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha. Whenever the heavenly Assistance is much saved, every difficult undertaking is simplified. The horizon of Persia was much darker; but as soon as the lights of the Kingdom appeared all the horizons were made luminous. Ere long the sun of Reality shall flood the regions with its refulgent rays. 

{{p11}}

Be ye confident in the confirmations of Baha-ullah. His Favors will change the drop into the sea; the small plant is developed into a mighty, overshadowing tree; the weak transformed into a powerful eagle; the impotent strengthened, the old rejuvenated, the patient healed, the unknown made famous, the babe attains the age of maturity and the "nothing" becomes "everything". In short, I bid you farewell and leave you under the Protection of the True One. I never expect to receive good news from you. They left silent and with a spirit of deep reverence. Another group entered the room with beautiful flowers in their hands and several children in their midst. They were greeted with the word of Allaho Abha. The words fell from his golden lips like stranded jewels: I wish to bid you farewell. {{p12}} My heart wishes to be always with you. To the same degree that meeting is sweet, separation is bitter. This farewell and remoteness do not prevent our communication; for the Love of Baha-ullah has united our souls and spirits. Our union is indissoluble. If we are for from one another, as the East from the West, we are nearer to each other than the angular vein; because spiritual susceptibilities are uninterrupted so that when the bodies are brought into contact, the spirits enjoy mutual association. Therefore, these super -human emotions rub in the Bahai world. I leave you beneath the shelter of Baha-ullah and as the brilliant signs of the Supreme Concourse. May you ever be protected and preserved!

The voice of the Master was the incarnation of spirituality, ethereal music. You could almost hear the angels of the Kingdom singing the anthems of glory. The room was filled again with eager, wonderful Bahais. The Master arose from his seat and was walking and speaking: Praise be to God that you have attained. This is our lat day in Stuttgart and the first day of your entrance into the Kingdom. Which I am away, I shall offer the utmost supplication {{p13}} toward the Kingdom of Abha, begging for your firmness and steadfastness, It is easy to enter in the Kingdom but it is difficult to remain in it firm and steadfast. It is possible for man to scale a mountain, and the road no matter how rocky and uneven will come to an end but it needs a strong constitution to whale the rarified ether, once stationed on the summit of the mountain. I hope you will attain to the utmost degree of firmness and steadfastness so that the Bestowels of Baha-ullah may surround you from all directions. The tests of God are violent. You must under all circumstances be firm and steadfast. There are often many events which happen against the expectation of man and which may shake his faith; but if he continues to remain firm through them, his head will be adorned with the Crown of happiness and he will became the center and greater usefulness in the Cause. You must {{p14}} exercise toward each other the utmost degree of love and friendship. Let not anything separate you from each other. Have always, the object of the Cause in view and the not the passing events. If some one commits any mistakes forgive him. Overlook the sins of others. Do not let the sinner Know by any illusion or suggestion that you know his shortimings Pardon the transgression of the sinner and God shall forgive your sins. Be ye firm. Be ye not like into a piece of straw to be blown either and thither by the contrary winds. You must be unshakable like into mountains and be imperturbable under the attack of ordeals and calamities. I will leave you in the hands of God. May you be protected under this all-encircling Canopy! May day unto day your hearts be induced with heavenly virtues; your severance from ought else save God become more pronounced! May you ever become lighter and lighter so that ye may soar freely toward the apex of Everlasting Glory! 

Several other groups had the privilege of meeting the Master and hearing his inspiring words. As these various groups left his room, they were gathered {{p15}} in the long corridor.By this time, there were more than one hundred people, all waiting to go to the station. Then more people came and no one could refuse them entrance into the Presence of the King. Do you see them entering, each kissing his hand and do you hear his voice; Welcome! Most welcome!" I desire to speak with you but my ears ever anticipate to receive good news from you; the nes of your love and affection towards each other; the news of your establishment in the Kingdom of Baha-ullah; the news of your advancement along ideal virtues. I have sown pure seeds arise to irrigate them and become the farmers of this divine plantation. Strive that these seeds may spring up, that they may grow, become thousands {{p16}} of sheds and form innumerable harvests. I expect this service from you. I shall never forget you. I shall ever remember you. They go out and another group enters: It is enough that I say unto you: I love all of you very much. My love for you is eternal and cordial. Space and Trime do not present our ideal communication. Although my body will be away, my spirit is here and I shall feel strongly your spiritual susceptibilities. Whenever I shall receive good news from you I will be made very happy. Rest ye assured that I will not forget you. All of us are bewithc the canopy of His Holiness Baha-ullah! We are under the Tent of His Covenant; therefore this physical separation has no influence. The foundation is the Love which exists between our hearts. May all of us gather in the Kingdom of Baha-ullah which is the world of light, the world of spirit and the world of Being. That meeting is eternal. Be ye confident in this promise. I am not far away from you I am eternally with you.

To the last group he touched the main idea of the Bahai Cause. He said: We are all the drops of one sea, the trees of one orchards, and the flowers of one rose gardens.

{{p17}}   

Therefore there is no separation between us. We are all under the Tabernacle of Baha-ullah. The lights of His Bestowals are shining upon us. The rays of one sun illumine our hearts, the breeze of one rose-garden perfumes our nostrils; the water always together. We shall never be separate. Although I stayed only a few days in Stuttgart but I hope the results will be infinite. May each one of you be the shining lamp of the Love of God and be the means of the illumination of this city!

Outside in the corridor by this time nearly two hundreds Bahais have been gathered, all talking in a subdued manner, many of them weeping. Innumerable Bahai looks and photos were brought to the Master to sign his name. In the look of Miss Daring he wrote:

"O Thou Possesor of the Kingdom! Accept this maid servant of Thy Threshold in {{p18}} the Count of Thy Holiness and bestow an illumined face to this attracted and enkindled one! Verily Thou art the Given and the Kind."

The Beloved left the hotel at 10:30 giving money to all the servants and maids who were on his way. Just before leaving the hotel, suddenly all the friends disappeared and as the Master entered the station, there they were - a long line of smiling-weeping faces. Crowds of people were curious. "Who is this man?" was on every lips. The train was ten minutes late so the Master was conducted into the waiting room. Immediately, he gathered about himself all the children. It was a most heavenly picture: The pretty heads of three bays on his breast, the others surrendered him; the Bahais clustered around. The time now is at hand. The Master starts for the train platform, the friends are after him. Before going into his compartment, every one again before the eyes of the public Kisses his hand. Oh! many of them are weeping! Many of them are {{p19}} sorrow-striker. It was a wonderful scene! I do not think Stuttgart had ever seen a scene like this! Handkerchiefs, hands and hats are being waved into the air. The Master comes to the window and consoles them. The passengers are wonderstruck at this extraordinary manifestation of love and reverence. The train now moves and a great scene appears before our eyes. How can I ever forget that miraculous demonstration! It is impossible to describe! It is impossible to think! The tumultuous scene was like unto a sea of love and affection. With this heavenly picture in our minds we faced Paris and left behind Stuttgart. It is only the power of Abhdul Baha that has made possible the realization of such {{p20}} glowing scene that King may well envy and emperor may sigh in vain. From the flowers in his compartment we inhaled the Fragrance of their love. We are extremely happy to live in this day and witness the power and majesty of the King of Kings!

Dear Harriet,

Abdul Baha is the spiritual spring of this age. Around this fountain all the nations of the peoples of the world have gathered to alloy their thirst. From this divine spring gushes forth the cooling water of life, irrigating the parched ground of the hearts and causing the growth of the hyacinths and anemones of love and affection. The supply of this heavenly fountain is inexhaustible, because it is connected with the most great sea of wisdom. Those people who have gathered around this fountain must not think only of themselves, but before starting on their pilgrimage, they must carry along then most capacious jars so on the eve of their return, they may fill them for thirsty at home. The jar is our capacity. We must present ourselves before Abdul {{p2}} Baha with free minds so that we may fill them with the jewels of his spiritual conceptions. Otherwise we may live with him for years and yet remain unchangeable. Day and night must we pray and strive in order that our capacity may be enlarge, our intelligence Keener, and our minds freed of all dreams so that we may become purer and purer channels for the expressions of his lofty ideals and noble principles. In the Kingdom of Abha we are all his children and we must be willing to learn the lessons which he teaches us. The greatest honor in this world is to be a Bahai and of course such a glorious faith carries with itself great responsibilities. May all of us became assisted to carry out at least one thousandth part of what Baha-ullah has revealed. The teachings of Our Beloved change the coal into his diamond and darkness into light. His glorious is mind is a secret place of thoughts and his heart a clear heaven studded with countless stars. His head is a heavenly factory wherein universal principles {{p3}} are fashioned and brought forth into the light of day.At all time he reveals to us the spiritual mysteries of the Kingdom and the deeper conceptions of the future humanity. His starry eyes pierce through the mist and fog of past and coming events, portraying to us the invisible images of truth. He observes what we do not see, he hears what we do not hear. His heart is attained with the infinite chards of life and his consciousness immersed in the sea of spiritual glories. From his tongue and his pen a river of light is flowing: world-regenerating ideas which would go into the make-up of a universal civilization and universal religion. He stands on the height of the mountain of Divine Humanity and invites us all to rise to his attitude.

{{p4}}

This morning Mon and Madame Dreyfies brought and a package of letters from American and after to the Beloved. Your letter was, interesting one and its contents gave much happiness to his heart of Abdul Baha, especially pleasing to him was the news that same of the sessions of the Bahai Convention will be held in the Masonic Temple and the Common of the Colombia University. He said: We have reconciled all the communities and sects together, because we are at peace with all and at war with none. For the benefit of Mon and Madame Dreyfus he spoke about his trip and the significant meetings held in various cities. He said: Indeed the highest and most perfect form of natural civilization has pitched its tent in Europe and people are enjoying the fruits of culture and sciences. The German people are very civilized. They are serious and earnest. They are industrious and energetic. He told them about his meetings with Prof Vambery and {{p5}} Prof. Goldzier in Budapest.

Mrs. Alice Beede them came with bouquets of flowers from Mrs Lilianthal. She was of course very happy to be with the Master in Peris. God has brought about the means to bring her here. Then she told him about the meetings in Mrs. Krugg, Miss Thompson, Mrs. C. Kimmy etc and presented messages from various Bahais and rereived answers. A name was given to the expected chill of your sister _ "Feevar" - it means Adornment."

Mrs. Scott called to inquire about the health of the Beloved. He said I have come again to Paris to see you.The believers of Stuttgart are blessed souls. They shall advance extraordinarily. I was most pleased with them. Today the Cause is being spread all over the world. {{p6}} The severe cities have become the enthusiastic admirers. The scoffers of yesterday are praising the Cause today. Those who in former time went up the pulpit and censured the Bahais are todays lauding them all to the sky. Those who we against it are for. This change has come over the Bahai worlds through the confirmations of God! May we all appreciate it and hold fast to the Cause. 

A very curious illustrated article was brought to the Master. It contained the photo of the Master with his two hands upraised to heaven, standing on the stairs of a Mohamadan Masque in Constantinople with many turbaned and fez Musulmons. Kneeling before him. Under this serio-comic Illustration was written "The New Prophet of Islam: Abdul Baha, teaching the relinquishment of prejudices and the holiday to fraternity in a Mosque in Constantinople."

The paper is called "Le petit Jourbal" and a copy of the same I am forwarding to you. The photographs of Stuttgart gatherings were in full evidence and shown to all those who came to see us." You must have had a wonderful time!" was the expression on every lip. The morning of our departure from Stuttgart, I mailed to you a set of six group photos autographed by the Master. It is needless to tell you; how much I value this set. Take good care of them. 

About 4 o'clock Mrs. Lilian that and Mrs. Beede were presented to the Beloved and he took them to his oven room. For nearly one hour conversation continued and emphasized the fact that {{p8}} today every Bahai must teach the Cause and spread the glad-tidings of the Kingdom. One Bahai must stand firm before the whole world and gain victory over them. Any soul who enters under the protection of Baha-ullah his receptivity will increase. He is a Kin to a tree which comes under the training of the sun. Day unto day, it will grow and develop. Consider at the time of Christ. The souls who become believers were either fishermen, taxgatherers and a peasant woman. But as they received a divine education they advanced and receive a share from the Breathes of the Holy Spirit. When we are surrounded with the confirmations of the Kingdom, God will confer upon us also the receptivity. Then spirituality and beatific consciousness shall be obtained. Teaching the Cause is of two Kinds. By words and by deeds. If bath are found in {{p9}} one person then it is light upon light. Mrs. Lilianthal said going through a cathedral, she bought a few candles and lights them on the altar in memory of the Master. He said: God has put in your hands a candle whose light is inextinguishable and is eternal. That candles is the candle of divine guidance and that light is the light of the Love of God. Be ye happy! Be ye fearless! Be ye joyful. Do not let anything worry you! Let your light shine! Teach the Cause! Do not tarry one moment. Raise your voice! Throw tumult in the hearts! Unfurl the banner of the Kingdom! This is not the day of silence! This is not the day of slothfulness! Awaken the people out of their deep slumber! Quicken the heedless ones and confess life upon the dead!

The Master was very happy today because he had received letters from Teheran giving the glorious news of the promulgation of the Cause. They are holding meetings full of the Love of God. Some of the gatherings are attended from 700 to 2000 people in which the principles of the Cause are publicly proclaimed. The doors of these meetings are open to all and strangers are welcomed. Just think of these wonderful events in the capital of Persia where a few years ago the Bahais were martyred and haunted to death!

In the evening all the Persians attended Man Dreyfus meeting. They were holding the Feast of Rizwan. The Master did not go, as he had to take care of his health. Many people were present. Although they were all happy to hear of the Beloved's return, yet there were expressions of regrets that he could not gladden their hearts with his holy Presence.

Man Dreyus read some Tablets and then asked me to give them an account of the last month's experience which I did to the best of my ability. After the meeting I spoke with Mr Holace Holly. The publishers both in America and England are printing his book on the Cause simultaneously and will be out on the market before long. Miss Erwin's two articles are accepted by a London magazine and will come out this month. Mrs. Mors, a French Bahai is writing a pamphlet on the Cause, especially adopted to the French temperament, Mr. Scotts meetings have been continued during {{p12}} our absence and new faces were seen, indicating the growth of the Cause. Rezwanich Khanam, the Persia woman who is with the Master's daughter chanted very sweetly one of Baha-ollah's prayers. Everyone was interested in her and she was encircled by the inquiring women. Ronha Khanam is yet in the hospital but her general health is improving. The Doctor has advised her to stay one month longer in the hospital.

Mirja Mahmaud and Myself walked home with Mrs Lilianthal and Mrs. Beede. The latter told me the news at home. We are all very glad to have them with us. They live in the hotel International which is only a few minute's walk from our hotel.



### BALTIMORE HOTEL 88 BIS, AVENUE KLEBER. May 3rd 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

As the word is given out that the Master is resting after his arduous trip and illness we have had no morning meeting yet and if I am not mistaken we may not have any regular meetings before the departure of the Beloved. This morning the Master sent many cables to Oriental Assemblies giving them the news of his arrival in Paris. Many friends called and brought flowers, others sending messages of inquiries and welcome. The hours of morning were spent in private interviews and reading letters from the Orient. I translated many Tablets for Our American brothers and sisters which were revealed in Vienna and other places.

{{p2}}

A few Persians hearing about the arrival of the Beloved came to the hotel to welcome him, back to Paris. They were received with gracious manner and heartfelt cordiality. In speaking to them he said: The spirit of patriotism has never been the means of progress in Asia. The love of country has never united the Eastern people; but the spirit of religion has ever given them marvelous advancement and progress. It is the same in this day. They must get hold of a new power of religion through which they may develop their latent possibilities. The Beloved invited Mrs Lilianthal and Mrs. Beede to take lunch with him today at one o'clock and they rejoicing accepted. In one of the private and quite rooms of the hotel a table was decorated with flowers and it was about half-past one when the Master followed by the rest of us went down. Doctor Mohamad Khan was present. There were many delicious courses, cooked of course a' la' Francais.

{{p3}}

Consider how miraculous is the power of Baha-ollah that has brought us together around this table and has encircled us with his majestic glorie. He spoke about the life of Christ, his ordeals and sufferings and how today the people are worshipping him. Mrs. Lilian that said that she had read in one of the American newspapers, that Abdul Baha was the only oriental teacher who visited the United States without accepting a cent but spent large seems for the allegation of the poor and the needy. The Master said: Praise be to God that we became assisted to follow the command of Christ; for he said, {{p4}} to his disciples, when you leave any city clear off your shoes even from its dust; meaning you have received the teachings freely, give them freely. About his American addresses he said: The contents of the speeches delivered before the churches and societies in America cannot be denied by any soul. For this reason everyone was attracted was attracted to the Cause." He spoke about the sensitiveness of the plants and how they have a degree of "feeling" according to their environments. There are various degrees of sensitiveness in all the Kingdoms of creation. Often, one word may reform a man, while on the other hand, all the processes of criminal laws may fail to ready just the moral life of another. One man may be highly sensitized tend responds quickly to all advices and exhortations but another may need sharper measures. This was illustrated in the case of a prime Minister of Persia who having a wonderfully intelligent and keen <5> man in his service reburked him one day for some slight thing which he had done unwittingly. This man left the presence of the Prime Minister and for a long time was sick through the effect of that one rebuke. Later on another Prince Minister was appointed. The police reported to him of the notorious deeds of a rough criminal who was making life miserable to the inhabitants of one of the sections of the city. Bring him to me I know how to punish him."

When they brought the criminal in order to walk in the footstep of his predecessor - he started to advise him, to threaten him and to show him with gentle words the evils of criminal actions. Hoping that this moral lesson will be sufficient, he let {{p6}} him go free. After a few days, they brought him the news that this man has committed worse crimes than ever, He was perplexed and he did not Know what to do; because in this case a moral persuasion proved a failure. He went, to the ex-prime Minister and explained the situation. "Ask the police to bring him here. I know how to punish him," the farmer Minister said. As soon as the man was brought he ordered the Farrashs to bring the Bastonadoes, his feet were raised up in the air and with fresh sticks just gotten from the trees, he was severely beaten. He was then taken afterwards to the prison and for sometimes vigorously handled. When the term of his prison life came to an end and was given freedom, he never dared to commit and their crime. "Ypu must reach that man through the sole of his feet and not moral persuasion" one day remarked the retired Primer Minister to his successor.

Beloved talked very much along these lives. He was very witty. {{p7}} After lunch he retired to his room and our American friends stayed over for tea.

At five o'clock a number of the friends dropped in to meet the Master. They were all happy to have heard so many wonderful events transpiring during his one manth of the absence. He said: On this journey many souls were set glow with {{p8}} the Fire of the Love of God and thy became exceedingly attracted to the Cause. I hope that you may also become the means of transplanting the indifference and shallowness of Paris. While staying in those cities we came in contact with many sects and many religions, each one holding fast to his own dogmas and superstitions. Each one investigating the reality according to his own thought and each person was happy to cling to his notions no matter how much how fantastic! We spoke with many such people. We presented to them irrefutable proofs and evidences as regards to certain divine principles. We asked of the Theosophists: 'How long   is it that you believe this system of thought? What has been the results of the activities of your society?' They answered: W have our beliefs, our secret doctoring our theories. We came together every week and speak about these things and initiate the inquirers.' The spiritualists answered: 'We have <9> materialization seances: we communicate with the spirits and we bring into closer relationship the visible with the invisible: In short we found the majority of these people follow blindly what others teach them and they are submerged in the sea of blind dogmas. We told them: In the world of existence there is a center for every great undertaking. You must investigate that center and once you have got hold of it, it will make you independent of all else saw God. For example; the planets have a center. Through that center the whole world is illumined. There are many light-giving bodies but they can only illumine a small tract of the space but sun shines upon all earth and its light enlightens it. 

{{p10}}

Consequently, there are many affairs in this world which are beneficial to the human society but are not universal in their results. These different interests need a common center around which they may revolve. The great universal center in this age is the Love of God and the Knowledge of God. Now, you must throw away all your oven thoughts and turn your attention to this center. Then all your conflicting ideas shall be reconciled and perfect assurance will be obtained. The lights of this lamps is not sufficient for you but the light of the sun shall make you independent. The wires which conduit the electric energy, the globes which confer lustre will same day be broken but the brilliancy of the Sun is eternal, its bestowals are everlasting, it's heat is never-ending. Then he raised his hands full of longing and desire for action, for great service in the Cause. His voice was full, {{p11}} throbbing with life-vibrations: Flame forth! Flame forth! Be a torch! Be a torch! Be not silent! Be not silent! Shine! Shine! Unless each one of you become a burning torch, the cause will not be spread, the influence of the Words will not be felt, the souls will not be attracted, the hearts will not be moved. Unless you get wings, you cannot fly; and soar over word. Hold the torches of the Love of God in your hands! Let your wings grow! I expect these things from you and I beg and entreat that in Paris you may become the brilliant lamps of the divine guidance!

Abdul Baha continued an hour ago I took a slow automobile ride through the street and Boulevard <12> of the city. I looked hard in the faces of the people but could not find the least sign of spirituality. They were all submerged in the sea of nature. There was not one luminous countenance to be seen. All were engulfed in the ocean of materialism. I observed most of them are as busy as ants and bees, trying to bring together the means of thrier comfort and livelihood. These people have studied many years to prepare themselves for their various vocations but the bees and ants are ready to occupy themselves with their duties as soon as they are born. An architect must study several years before he can practice but the bee without any study is a perfect architect. Therefore this highest summit of economic independence and happiness that man strives to attain has already been sealed without any exertion on the port of the bee and the ant. Just think of the perfect architectural flow of the bee {{p13}} which builds its hexagonal combs with such precision and exactitude that one is astonished! Its food is the extract of the flowers and its independence is so complete that it does not require any assistance from others but it assists others by giving them a quantity of sweet honey. But man must study hard, many years and then labor, night and day in order to be able to build a house, prepare a table which may not be as perfect architecturally as honey-comb; thus man desires to become as low in his ambition as the bees and ants. The bee ever hopes from one bush to another, thoughtless and carefree, inhaling {{p14}} the fragrance of the variegated flowers and new thinking of tomorrow. If such is the highest stab of human happiness and virtue, then the bees and the ants are the happiest and most virtues! Therefore the happiness of man and the eternal prosperity of the people lie in the Knowledge of God, the Love of God the virtue of the world of humanity and the ideal perfections. If man obtains these virtues, he is superior to the animals; otherwise he is inferior to them. When I was in Acca one day I went into a garden and sat on the veranda, my attention was attracted by a spider building its nest. I watched it and was so amazed at its deatreity going on making sure perfect triangles and geometrical designs, all equal to each other, and many wonderful parable lines etc.

<15> 

The lives were so perfect geometrically that it would no doubt have taken two days for an architect, with all its instruments to do the same amount of work. Then I thought to myself: 'How civilized and cultured is this spider! Let all the geometricians come and learn from it! Civilization unquestionable is beneficial! Perfection in every line is praise worthy, whether material or spiritual. But the natural civilization must not prevent us from the Graces of the spiritual civilization! We must not let ourselves be so drowned in the sea of materialism as there may not remain any chance of our salvation and be deprived of all the bounties and Favor of the Kingdom. God has deposited in man a {{p16}} holy power which is the discovery of the reality of phenomena, which transcends the regulations of nature and which rules over the powers of the physical world. Through that power man is distinguished from the animal. Is it not regretful that man loses his great opportunity by not employing this power properly and like unto the worms go deeper and deeper below the earth. O hope that you may become the means of quickening of their people, that they may be drown unto the Kingdom; their susceptibilities, become illumined, the perfections of humanity, be revealed and the divine attributes become manifest. I will pray for you.

Such were the wonderful words of the Beloved on this day!

Day unto day we realize to a Greater degree the spiritual stations of the Master and his wonderful prescience in all things. His thought encircles the universe! His ideal embraces the world of creation. His ethereal music enraptures the hearts. His presence inspires the souls. His conceptions rekindled the fire of youth. His divine vitality regenerates the old. His sun quickens into full activity the latent forces of nature. His stars shed lambent and soft lights of reality. His breeze stirs into motion the branches of the trees of life. His words bring order out of chaos. His principles giant-like, march on the surface of the earth making conquest at every turn. His Presence is a joy. His smile is a benediction! His truth triumphant and his life is light.

This morning the Master received many people among them was Mrs. Henry P. Fraser from Johansberg; S. Africa who is a great intimate friend of Mrs Ella Aooper. She is a California woman but married to an Englishman and is now living in S. Africa. She told once that she is the first spiritual child of Mrs. Cooper. She was taught by her twelve yrs. ago. She has been always longing to see the Master and often expected to go to Acca. When she arrived in London and heard that the Master was going to be in Paris she asked the permission of her husband to come here and see him. The Master inquire from her about Johausberg and whether there were any Bahais there. He said: "I will pray to God that you may receive a great power where to teach many souls and convince many people about the validity of this truth. Be confided that Baha-ollah shall assist and confirm you."  

The meeting of the Bahais is based upon spiritual susceptibilities but the meeting of other people is based from physical emotions. The attraction of the Bahais toward each other is divine and spiritual. When I heard thy name this morning, I felt a sweet fragrance and as I look into the face now, I see thou hast great receptivity. Some people are like iron. They are hard, cold and black; others are like unto the wick and oil. As soon as the two are brought into contact with the fire, they are illumined. Thou shalt receive the breathes of the Holy Spirit and thou shalt become assisted to teach the Cause. About {{p4}} Mrs. Goodoll and Mrs. Cooper he said: They are very spiritual souls. They are the brilliant Jewels of the Kingdom of Abha."

Mrs Lilianthal and Mrs. Beede had an interview and permission was granted them to came to Egypt, where the Beloved is going to sojourn for a while and later on they will go to visit the Holy Touch of Baha-ullah.

To Mr. Richard and a few other French Bahais he said: you are welcome! We have returned to Paris to sec what the believers have been doing; whether the Fragrances of the Kingdom of Abha have been spread. We have been travelling last month through Germany, Hungary and Austria and in each country we found souls, ready to hearken to the call of the Kingdom. Many large meetings were held and addresses {{p5}} were delivered. A number of souls become informed and turned their faces toward the Kingdom of Abha. During the few weeks we were there, extraordinary progress was made.

To a few others he said: We have come to Paris and are saving the seeds. Can you arise and irrigate them? When the divine farmer ploughs the ground and salters the seeds, his heart is attached to it. Day and night, he is watching his field to see when the tiny seeds push out of the earth. Then he trains them, waters them till they grow, reach to the stage of friction and his labors of many month is crowned at last with rich a harvest: but if he sees the field was barren, the seeds not germinating and he feels sad and the labor lost {{p6}} despondent. I desire you to become the ideal farmers and irrigate the trees of existence.

All the inhabitants of the world are farmers. The difference is in the application. Some are farmers of commerce; others farmers of industry, a number of people are farmers of politics, but these farms only become verdant and do not yield any fruits. However, there is a heavenly forming whose fruits are eternal. Look at the farm of Christ which yields harvests every year increasingly and has done for the last 2000 years. His holiness Christ was himself of a farmer, for he said: I scatter the seeds. Some of them fall by the way and they are wasted, others fall on the rock, they grow for a day or two and their whether away, while others fall upon pure ground. They will grow and develop and bring many harvests. We must sow such seeds in the blessed ground of the hearts. His Holiness Baha {{p7}} ollah has given us such wonderful seeds that they will grow in spite of all the contrary winds and hurricane! He is our heavenly Agriculturist. He teaches us how to do this spiritual farming.

To a Frenel Bahai who has been giving a few pictures in the meetings he said: I am most pleased with you, because you are attracted to the Kingdom of Abha and art uttering the words of God. You have become active soldiers who is in the thick of fight and art gaining victories for the King of Kings. The supreme commander looks always with solicitude towards the battle ground, thinking of the protection of his courageous army, but the Reservists who {{p8}} stay behind in the barracks do not receive much of his attention until they also enter the field of action.

Mr. Holly who has written a book on the cause and the publishers both in America and England have accepted it and will be out on the market before long came with his wife and his little girl of two years to see the Master. The girl at first did not go to the beloved but candy and fruits tamed her. He had a box of Candy in his hand. She did not wanted to take all the candies but she took one piece and running back gave it to Madame Dreyfus. She went back and forth taking one piece from the Master and bringing it for Madame Dreyfus. Then she took them one by one to the Master again. Someone mentioned thet Mr. Holly's book will be out soon and the Beloved painting to the child said: This is another book of Mr. Holly. This is a living book, a book of God. God has written this book.

Speaking on healing in answer {{p9}} to the question of Mrs. Holly, the Master said: For healing, prayer and medicine both are necessary. God has created the herbs and the plants with their useful properties. God has deposited in all the objects a definite effect. The effect of fire, for example is burning. It is ridiculous for one to enter in the fire and say repeatedly "I am not burned. I am not burning. He will be burned in spite of himself. One of the followers of this school came to me and said 'There is no pain. Pain is a phantasm of the brain.' I said: 'All right. I am going to get a big cone and beat hard on your back. By this actual demonstration we will find out whether there is such a thing as pain: He did not submit to the experiment.

Another lady who was most dogmatic and demonstrative in this belief carried a long controversy with me on this subject.

<10>

Finally I got out of patience. I told her, I observe one of your eyes is a little cross: Then say, 'there is no cross-eye; there is no cross eye. My eye is perfect. And we will see whether this negative repetition will do way with an actual disease. By these things, I do not mean that there is no effect in prayer. In certain nervous and spiritual diseases, prayer is most effective and bestows divine healing. Disease is nothing else but a disturbance of equilibrium between the various organisms and functions of the body; healing is to gain that equilibrium. When the measures of the various elements which go into the make up of a healthy constitution are disturbed, sickness is produced. For instance let us suppose that there must need to be 2000 grows of saccharine element and 2000 grows of gelatin element in the body of man in order to live normally. Now when the quantities of these measures are disturbed, then, the body is attacked with disease. A course of treatment which will give back the normal standard to these elements will be {{p11}} conducive to health. Again, thirst, is a kind of sickness. When the quantity of humidity becomes less in the constitution, it demands water. How much ever we may think and try to demonstrate that we have no thirst, it will be of no avail, and when you are hungry all the thoughts and demonstrations of the world will not satisfy you. You would like to have perhaps a roast-chicken or a beef steak or a juicy goose-berry per. In brief there are physical diseases and spiritual diseases. The farmer must be treated with medicine and prayer and the latter with prayer alone.

A few friends came in and for a while the thread of conversation was lost. The Master raising His voice after greeting he newcomers and said: We have been talking about healing. {{p12}} The physical body after all is not important. This material world is not important neither its contingencies should affect us. The natural world in comparison to the spiritual is non-existent. We speak about ideal virtues and heavenly healing. This body of man is subject to decomposition no matter how much he may try to preserve it. The importance lies in the spirit of man which is eternal. One must think of that. Often the body is sick but the spirit is healthy and again the body may enjoy the utmost of health but spirit is sick. I hope you will obtain both conditions. Turn your faces to God and he will answer all your prayers. 

To another he said: Today the Bestowals of the Kingdom of Abha are waving like unto a limitless sea; only capacity is necessary. The soul's must become like unto the fish and swim in this great sea.

He said to another: Today those who arise to spread the news of the Kingdom of Abha are confirmed. {{p13}} Whenever I see enkindled souls I am made happy. When the holy Fragrances of the divine rose-garden reach my nostril I am rejoiced.

Mrs. Lilianthal mentioned the fact that going through many churches, she was shown the remains of the real cross. The Master gave a most interesting amount of how after 300 yrs this alleged cross was found in Jerusalem by St. Hellew, the mother of Coustantine the Great, while no wood no mother how string its resisting power can stand the ravaging and corroding influence of the time under the earth.

For dinner and supper the Beloved comedown to the general dining room and we three servants of his had him to ourselves. He is so wonderfully loving and Kind to us all.

{{p14}}

In the afternoon a believers came to see the Master. When I sense the love and unity of the friend I gain health and fresh strength. I have heard that thou art speaking in the meetings and read the prayers. Read always the supplications. Turn always thy attention toward God. Be always stirred with divine Fragrances; then eternal happiness will be thy share. The everlasting bliss inspires the heart of man to sing and dance and be happy even under the sword of the execution. Once there was a Bahai teacher who went to the city of Khashan. Whenever he went he thought this revelation till one day he was invited to a large meeting. No sooner he sat down than he began to teach the Cause. The people objected and the guests complained to the host to stop him. It was winter and according to Oriental custom a brazier of live burning charcoal was in the middle of the room. He said to the assembled guests and his host : I cannot stop. I cannot remain silent. I want to be quiet but an invisible force impels me to speak. It has taken the rein out of my hand. I am unconscious! I have lost myself. I have forgotten all my conditions! One of the enemies then addressed him; If thou art unconscious put thy hand in thy fire! While he was speaking <15> to them he extended his hand and put it on the fire. His hand was burning and he was teaching the Cause; he was laughing, and happy. Someone told him. For heaven's sake! it is enough! take out thy hand from the fire! He said: 'No! let it burn! I am enjoying it! This is the day of my happiness! Let me continue to tell you about Baha-ullah and his life and his teachings! Another person jumped from his seat and by force took his hand out of the fire. It was very much burned. This man - this Bahai - was so immersed in the sea of spiritual susceptibilities that he did not feel this pain and suffering. I hope that all the believers of God may {{p16}} attain to this exalted station and be so engulfed in the ocean of superhuman emotions as to forget themselves and the world; thus opening the eloquent tongue and receiving the successive assistance of the Kingdom of Abha.

Dear Harriet!

The longer the Master stays in Europe the greater will be the promotion of the Bahai Teachings. As his work is universal and as he speaks with and teaches all the people without any distinction of creed, color or race, everyone is attracted, not only to him but to the sublime ideals which appear from his pure mind and transparent heart. He goes before every church, he enters every Society, and he associates with every nation with a view of assisting them to look away, the scale from their eyes, to look upon, the reality from its general aspect and to enter upon a larger field of moral and social activity. A Bahais is not a sectarian or dogmatic. He is not exclusive but inclusive and he practices what he preaches.

{{p2}}

"I am a lover of mankind" he declares. He is ever ready to sacrifice everything to demonstrate his love for humanity. "I have burned away all the traces of self and go". He shows this is his self-control and sanctification. A Bahai is not a leader but a servant. There are no ordained ministers in this Cause but everyone whose heart is pure, whose motive is unselfish, whose deeds conform to his words, whose tongue is eloquent, he is a teacher of the Divine Logos. The Bahais are a community of spiritual servants and social workers. They are not bound with the fetters of dogmas and the chains of withering creeds. Like the birds of the air, they are free. Like the refreshing breezes of the morn, they waft from all direction of any reward; they have dedicated their lives to the service of their fellowmen. Their minds are the treasures of the New Ideals of this age which shine like unto the jewels and gleam with the purity of the pearls. They hate cant and uphold the standard of honesty. They are in the Vanguard of the army of universal {{p3}} civilization. A Bahai is a lover of the rose and its fragrance. He is a lover of light no matter in which glass it shines. He is an adorer of Reality no matter from which direction it appears. Untrammelled from all past traditions, he is a Cosmopolitan in its truest and widest application. He sympathizes with every movement which broadens the horizon of human intellect and uplifts his conceptions to a higher level of divine consciousness, and to the best of his ability he will strive to co-operate with them in the light of the Bahai Movement. The teachings of Baha-ullah are for all the people and all the races. He has flung wide the doors of the Kingdom and all men have witnessed the Glory of the Lord and the Excellency of His Countenance.

{{p4}}

As there are no "secret doctrines" in the Bahai movement, there are no "secret classes". Open are the doors! Everywhere we raise our eyes we read in burning letters of gold the heavenly sign:"Welcome! All men a welcomed!" The divine trumpet has sounded. The Call of Reality is heard. The oneness of the world of humanity is proclaimed. The angels of heaven have descended. The age of narrowness and sectarianism has passed away. The Light of God has appeared. The century of Radiance has come. The divine Tent of spiritual brotherhood is pitched. The principles of universal civilization are declared. Mankind is being stirred with a new dynamic spirit. Spiritual susceptibilities are born in many hearts. The East and the West are brought nearer to each other. A new era of interracial justice is upon us. Hidden forces are bringing into activity the thoughts which are half felt in the hearts. All mankind has heard the sweet rapturous song of "Divine Humanity" sung by the heavenly Artist and they are new straining their ears to listen to all its soft, mellow, undertones which stream down from the spiritual spheres.

{{p5}} 

This morning the Master served tea with his own hand and a propos of the weather he grew reminiscent and gave us some interesting side-light upon the history of the Cause in Adrianople. "When we were exiled again from Begolad" he commenced", in our company there was a Bahai by the name Mirza Ahmad Kashani. He accompanied Baha-ollah to Constantinople and later on to Adrianople. One night we were invited to a feast. The guests were divided into two and when the supper time came each company was served with a dish of rice and one chicken. It so happened that I was made the partner of Mirza Ahmad. As we sat around the table to eat, my partner humorously remarked to geta wing from the chicken of our neighbor, a piece of breast from another company, a let from a {{p6}} third and so on. I did so, thinking that he will in turn decide our chicken amongst the believers; instead of doing this he ate all and everybody was most amused. He ate also my share. He was your namesake (the Master turned to me laughing). I had given him the title of "geometrician", because he liked to get the first of everything and in order to gain his aim, he would devise many humorous plans, calculated to make anybody laugh. When he entered a meeting, he would look all around and then sit a place where the "humble-bubble" would by one of the believers, he would go to him in a hurried fashion. "I have a most important affair to attend to and I must go out now. I cannot wait any longer. Please have a glass of tea." All these innocent plans, he would resort to, in order to drink a cup of tea before anybody else; because he believed all the aroma of the tea was in the first cup. One day he asked, why do you call me "geometrician?" I know not even the first principle of geometry." I told him that I will answer has question in the form of a story. Once upon a time {{p7}} a rich merchant was passing by a slave-market. The noise and tumult attracted his attention and he joined the crowd. He saw the slave-trader wassanctioning a slave and mentioning, accounting", as one of his talents. The Merchant said to himself. I have an accountant in my office to whom. I pay $100 a month. Now I will buy this slave him for life - thus saving much money. He then bought the slave and brought him to his home, rejoicing in his heart that he has been today a shrewd business man. He sat in his room and as the slave was standing near the door, he told him to go and bring him a glass of water. The slave did not move from his place but made several motions with his fingers (here the Master represented the Motions). The Merchants getting out of his patience told angrily to the slave; What do you {{p8}} mean by disobeying me?' The slave said: I was counting just now with my hands that 1st I must go and bring the water 2nd I must return, 3rd I must stand a long time till you drink, 4th I must take back the empty glass, 5th I must return to my place; but you can save three times, if you go, drink the water and come back. The merchant was white with rage. 'Is this the way you are an accountant?" "Yes", the submissive slave answered.

The first winter we spent in Adrianople was severely cold and this Mirza Ahmad Kashani not being accustomed to hard was severely cold and this Mirza Ahmad Kashani not being accustomed to hard climate suffered very much. In fact all of us endured the most difficult hardship. Having lived all our lives in moderate and warm climate, the rigorous air of Adrianople was unendurable. The weather was so called that the water was frozen in copper jars and vases and as a result, they were broken to pieces. One morning I wanted to open the door. My fingers were congealed to the bar of iron and when I tried to push them back the skin was torn off. As the home where the women lived was a little far, whenever I wanted to call on them, I would cover all my {{p9}} my head and face with the Aba, "leaving only a small hole for one of my eye to see my way. Notwithstanding this, the cold was so bitter, the wind, so biting that it was as though someone drove a sword, a dagger or an arrow into my eye. Although we had several rooms in the house, we decided that twelve of us stay in one room to get warmer. We did not have any heavy clothing's and the one who had even a light overcoat was considered most fortunate. In this one room we had a tin-plate oven and we made fire to keep us warm. The oven would get as red as fire. Near it we would put two or three bottles of water to be kept warm for drinking. When we got up after midnight to drink, the fire of the oven had naturally given out and the water in the bottles was frozen. We had to make fire, than the ice and drink a glass of the water. That year a flock of sheep with their shepherd were frozen to death in the country. The inhabitants said, they had never seen such a winter in their lives. In short through it and when the spring came around, the country became verdant and the hearts were made glad.

And in order that I may also feel if not the rigor of Adrianople winter at least the rigor of his hands he stride toward me and said: "Would you like to have a slap this early morning? He did not wait for my answer and doves came the thunder and the booming of the heavenly artillery! On my right and left cheek, I received the strokes of gone, but stood on my ground.

During the day Mrs. Beede and a number of other friends called, each receiving the celestial benediction of his words. He took his lunch with us and before that he went out to take a walk. In the afternoon {{p12}} he called at the hospital to pay a visit on Rauha Khanom. She has improved much and in a few weeks she will become entirely well. On his return he sent us to Mr. and Mrs. Seatt's meeting. Mrs. Richard spoke in French on Love and the Equality of the senses. As the Master had asked me to speak I obeyed.

In the evening a number of the Persians came and he asked from one who was a student: How many Persian Bahais are in Paris? The number was given. Then he said: "The life of man is very precious; so he must spent it in a precious Cause. To study the sciences of commerce, agriculture and medicine is very praiseworthy but to concentrate all our time upon such things is not good. If the Persian believers <12> arise to teach the Cause of God in Paris it will be very good. At least they must try to teach others Persians. The believers of God must not remain silent. They must not be quiet. They must not be speechless. They must not be withered. They must not be lukewarm. They must have life, motion, spirit. It is true that man must work, engage in an occupation so that he may not become a burden on the community but all his ambition must not revalue around this. His aim must be to rise day unto day in the seale of divine and human virtues; his today be better than his yesterday and his tomorrow better than today. If this condition does not exists in the life of every Bahai there is mo doubt that he is a looser and is in manifest regret, "What did you do today?" The answer is: we ate, we walked, we slept, we dressed.' 'What are you going to do tomorrow.' The same thing.' 'And after-tomorrow.' The same thing! How low and dspicable must be the thoughts of men and women who satisfy themselves with these animal propensities. Man must render a worthy service to the world of humanity. He must plant a tree which may produce fruits. He must lay a foundation which may remain unshakable throughout all the coming ages. His heart must find satisfaction in God. Do not believe for one moment that it is possible for man to obtain happiness, joy, serenity and confidence save through God. If his heart is not attached to God, no matter how seemingly permanent is the structure of his material happiness, it will latter down. The utmost is this: He will live a few days, he will (over) {{p13}} drink a few cups, he will smoke a few cigar, thus he will dance a few steps, he will call on a few friends and then, what then the curtain will fall down, the voices are hushed, the darkness prevail and eternal silence and oblivion spread their ominous wings. 

Love to all,

Ahmad

Dear Harriet!

Paris is the heaven and Abdul Baha is the sun which shines upon all creation. This is his third visit to this city and much hope is expressed on all sides that the spiritual life of Paris may become vibrant with a new quickening. The friends of God are doing their utmost to create interest in the Bahai Cause and spread the teachings as far and as widely as possible but much individual work is necessary. With the sound of trumpet, these people must become awakened out of their gross negligence and sleep. While the divine beloved is amongst them, they must realize its great importance and the blessing which will bring in its train.

{{p2}}

This morning the Master called me about 6 o'clock and asked me to go out and buy a newspaper. His keen interest in the important news of the day is the most wonderful thing I have ever seen. Seldom a day passes without I read to him the news out of New York Herald (Paris Edition) or other French papers. Many Arabic newspapers from Egypt are sent to him and he reads them with great attention. Those who think they do not have time to read at least a few minutes, the daily news may learn from the Master. Often I would think I am too busy to read the papers and I confess were it not for the Master, I would have hardly opened any of the continental newspapers.

These sad events, he said after hearing the news, which are transpiring in the East and the results of thoughtlessness. Thoughtlessness is the worst calamity of the human race. When constitution was declared in Turkey, the people demonstrated their joy and happiness in thousand of ways. They decorated the streets and the beggars with {{p3}} flags and buntings. They thought that the magic, words of liberty, equality and fraternity will immediately adjust all the accumulated wrongs of the past regime. The governor of Akka after our freedom asked my opinion as regards to the success of the Constitutional government in Turkey. I told him so far as we are concerned, we are grateful to the young Turks because they have given us our liberty but their own future is fraught with danger and instability. It is good for a country's development to have two or more political parties, for they check and oppose each other's excesses. But if these parties become selfish and inimical toward each other, they will destroy the happiness of the people. The political organizations must pledge themselves {{p4}} in the sight of God to work for the general progress of the country irrespective of party line and party allegiance. A person becomes the member of a political party in order that he may become a more useful citizen of the country. In short, the political parties in Turkey and Persia failed deplorably, because as they were fundamentally antagonistic to each other, they assisted substantially the downfall of their countries.

I told him that while he is now in Paris it will be a good thing if he could go one day to Fontainbban. He laughed and said: The people of this world are thinking of building palaces but the believers of God are thinking to build the Palace of Eternal Life. That palace is only for a few days, this Palace is for eternity. God has built for you a palace which is indestructible and luminous with the glories of Baha-wllah and as there was no one else in the room he approached me, quietly smiling, striking two hard blows on my right and left cheeks and strode away. My good son! That heavenly palace is worthy. That palace is the palace of the Teaching's of God, that Palace is the religion of God, that Palace is the Love of God, {{p5}} that palace is universal Peace, that palace is the oneness of the world of humanity. We are laying the foundation of that Palace and ere long its turrets shall reach to the sky.

As soon as the Master left America, now and then, letters were received that some of the believers thought and felt that the activities of the Persian American Educational Society in Washington DC were against the desire and consent of the Beloved. The contents of these letters were presented to him and in several instances answers were revealed and forwarded. I have refrained up to this time to mention anything in the diary in regard to this matter, because having founded the Society, the friends may have thought that I have some personal aims to further or cherish. But I believe now the time has come for the removal of this wrong impression from amongst the friends. This {{p6}} morning two other such letters were received by the Master. This Beloved was very much affected and told me emphatically to write to the Secretary of the Society to contradict such erroneous feeling: It is strange! he said, that the people put aside my many Tablets written on this matter and go by their own feelings. Write to Mr. Jos Hannen to make public my explicit texts concerning the Society and its future. Do I changed my mind from time to time? There may be some people who not desiring to assist the Society may invent such feelings. If anyone has a Tablet in his hand proving that I am not in Favour of the progress of the Society, let him bring it out, otherwise why should anyone rely upon such hearsays? I have often remarked in America that only my Tablets are authority and nothing else. In my last address in California and in conversation with the friends, I have encouraged them to assist the Society. Today the most important affair in the world is cooperation between the East and the West. Is it possible that I may be against such a great principle? The Orient-Occident Unity has undertaken to carry out this {{p7}} wonderful idea and it needs the assistance of all the friends. Then he dictated a Tablet to one of the American friends as follows: "Thou hast written concerning contributions for the education of the pupils of the school of Tarbiat. Cooperation and mutual assistance are the fundamental principles of the religion of God. The East must assist the West and the West must assist the East. Whosoever quotes a statement from my tongue, ask from him the authority for the same, either in my handwriting or with my signature. If he has such an authority in his hand, all right; if he has no such authority, do not give any importance to traditions. Keep this criterion always, before your view." In another Tablet revealed by him on the steamer Celtic just one day after our departure from New York he said: "You have written that you desire to assist {{p8}} the Orient-Occident Unity. Undoubtedly the Orient and the Occident must assist each other; especially in the question of the school of Tarbiat. The believers of the East have contributed toward the Mashrekal-Azkar of America, although they were in the utmost state of poverty and confusion. If the school of Tarbiat in Teheran is assisted by the Western believers, unquestionably it is the cause of happiness." The Society before Abdul Baha's arrival in America undertook the publication of Bahai literature and informing the American press about the history and teachings of the Cause in a manner which was impossible for any other agency to do at that time exactly the same kind of work. Besides this, it kept informing outside organizations and churches about the nature of the mission of Abdul Baha and as a result of this, innumerable invitations were forwarded to the Beloved long before he left Egypt. In a Tablet received by the Society at that time the Master himself mentioned the receipt of 30 invitations. All this work was undertaken and praise be to God, carried to consummation not only in the {{p9}} face of manifest or silent opposition from certain quarters but it was done with pure faith and assurance. Some of the friends gave financial assistance to publish and circulate all this literature but it was not sufficient. Now, the Society is in debt to the amount of nearly $600 which must be paid as soon as possible. This debt is already of a year standing. God bears testimony to what I say, that if I was in America I would have worked with great joy, even as a laborer in the streets to pay off this debt, and I know I would have succeeded. But I am not in there. At present I have nothing but a willing heart to serve and I assure you it will not pay the printer's bill. I must say also that the debt of the Society consists of one item and that is only the printer's bill. Mr. Jos Hannen can give you the details. The Master hopes {{p10}} that this debt of the Society is soon cleared so that unhampered, it may take up new activities and new channels for bringing the East and the West closer together. The Orient-Occident Unity is a wonderful agency of Union between the East and the West if we use it and keep it oiled and foster it wisely till step by step it may attain to its full stature. Another aspect of the activity of the Society is the maintenance of a number of scholarships in the school of Tarbiat in Teheran. This has been more or less the chief contained activity of the Society since its organization. It is hoped that these scholarships will be continued and those who are in arrears - if impossible for them to meet this small obligation - others may take their places. This is only a very small service on the part of the Western Bahais to their brothers and sisters in Persia. It will be very regrettable indeed if these scholarships are discontinued and the interest in the activities of the Society waved in the face of the great desire of the Beloved. He had hoped and he is yet hoping to see the aims of this Society progressing and advancing, ever becoming a more and more useful {{p11}} instrument for the closer relationship of the East and the West.

The Beloved revealed some wonderful Tablets for the believers of Stuttgart; one to Mr. Herrigel, another to Consul Schwarz, to Miss Anna Kasthin, Miss Alma Knoblock etc. When he finished dictating the Tablet he said: Truly I say the believers of Stuttgart merit every Love! What blessed souls they are! What heavenly beings they are! their faces were illumined and their hearts were pure!

He told to be ready to go out with him and for an hour I walked behind him in the avenue Kleber in the sunshine for about one hour and then returned. He said: The sun is the fire-place of God, it warms all the world and all the people.

{{p12}}

Upon our arrival we found several friends were waiting, amongst them Mrs. Beede, Mrs. Fraser of Johannesberg, South Africa. The Master remarked jokingly that he desires to stay here a few days to rest before he leave for the East, if Mirza Ahmad would let him.

A propos of something he said to another: Before you teach others, teach yourself. Man must first test his knowledge in himself to see whether it is workable on theoretical.

Mrs. Ethel Fraser asked him about his health and he answered: I do not give any importance to physical health. The real health is spiritual and that is eternal. The spirit of man must become reinforced. This body will be decayed; this building no matter how solid it's basis will be destroyed some day. Just think how J. P. Morgan travelled everywhere to get back his health but there was no result. The spirit of man which is the effulgence of God and the eternal Bestowal of the Almighty has importance. We must think of the health of the spirit more than the body. What importance lies in the glass! We must think of the light which illumines the glass. {{p13}} The light of the spirit illumines the world of existence and release it from the clutches of materialism. The ears can hear the voice in a limited distance, the vision of the eyes similarly is circumscribed but the spirit sees the East and the West; while in the West it organizes important affairs in the East; while on earth it discovers heavenly satellites, it unfolds the mysteries of phenomena; it goes under the earth and brings into the light of day the geologic secrets. These are some of the discoveries of the spirit on the physical plane; which the wonders of its spiritual discoveries are infinite; through them the dark man is made luminous; if he is thrown in the sea of tests, he is yet dry and if he is in the midst of burning furnace he is yet cool. This is important.

{{p14}}

The Master introduced Mrs. Fraser to some of the friends present and then said: The Bahais do not need any introduction. God has introduced them to each other. There is a mystical union between their hearts. In Persia the believers know each other without any introduction.

Many American friends were present. He said: It is good that even in Paris there are so many Americans in the meeting; even the Cause was first introduced to America and later on it was brought to Europe. Undoubtedly the Americans were worthy of this privilege. 

Then the Master went out with Doctor Mohamad Khan to take a walk and on his return we had lunch with him. In the afternoon Madame D. Astre came in and had a long talk with the Master about the freedom of Oriental women and how it was necessary to bring some of the Persian women either to Europe or America to breathe the fresh air of social intercourse. The Beloved assured her that all these things shall come to pass but we must wait so that the seeds sown may germinate and take root.

In the evening Miss Sanderson {{p14}} Rezwanieh Khanom and another friend come and called on the Master. They had a long talk with him. Rezwanieh Khanom and Mirza Jalal are leaving for Haifa after tomorrow; but he will return later to Paris to take his wife. Meanwhile she is in the hospital and according to the report she has improved wonderfully. Formerly her headache troubled her very much and she could not sleep, now she sleeps seven hours. I think she will stay in the hospital for another month.

After four o'clock I had a fine ride with the Master. For more than one hour we drove through the avenues. It was so great and so heavenly to sit beside him, look into his face all the time instead of watching the aimless crowd. He said: I do not feel happy in Paris. I do not know whether it is its depressing {{p16}} atmosphere or the effect of the indifference of the people in spiritual things. As I look upon these crowds and these buildings my heart is compressed. I wish to leave this city as soon as possible. I wonder how the people can live in such an atmosphere all their lives and be happy, spending their precious time in hunting, racing and devising new games and pastimes.

He grow silent and when our carriage arrived near the Seine he raised his head and said: Last night I had a dream. In this dream I saw the Blessed Perfection standing before a large gathering. I was also amongst those people. He was speaking in a new language that all of us could understand. It was not Arabic or Persian or Turkish but a new language. My heat was filled with joy because I thought this must be the universal language spoken of by himself 50 years ago. Then I began to think whether the Holy Tablets were translated in these new language but as the Blessed Perfection was speaking I was ashamed to asked {{p17}} from the friend who was sitting next to me. Then a voice was heard from the outside and the Blessed Perfection told me to go out and find who was he. As I came out I saw a tall man with luminous face, white beard and white locks falling down his shoulder. He had a most pleasant countenance and sweet voice. He also spoke in this new language. I asked him from which part of the world does he come from? He said: From Jabolgo and Jaborsa! (Now these two cities are the two imaginary places where according to Mohamadan traditions the Promised one is living and the Bahais exploded this idea). When he said that I have come from Jabolgo and Jaborsa, I thought now how are we going to answer the Mohamadans? Then I asked him {{p18}} in which part of the world these two cities are situated? He smiled and said: These cities are not on the earth, they are in heaven. I became very happy and exclaimed. You are a heavenly being! Let us go to Baha-wllah? While he was engaged in a wonderful divine conversation with the Blessed Perfection in the new language. I was so overjoyed that I awake. I have been happy since then.

Love to all

Ahmad



### BALTIMORE HOTEL 88 BIS, AVENUE KLEBER. May 7th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

Today the King of Spain payed an official visit to the French Republic and the principal Boulevards and avenues were bedecked with the Flags of the two nations. For the next three days he will be the guest of the government in the Palace of the State Department and then he will return to Madrid. Most elaborate program for his entertainment was announced in the dailies and his photos and descriptions are in every hand and on every tongue. A certain section of the French people do not like entertaining Royalty and manifest their dislike in no unmistakable manner. "We claim to be a Republic", they vociferously cry out "what have we to do with an old tattering Monarchy of the worst type". But no one listens to them and the procession {{p2}} of events go on gayly. Extreme precaution is being taken by the Police department to avoid any eventualities and many arrests have been made of the so-called hair-brained anarchists and radical socialists. Bitter and venomous speeches were delivered attacking the character of the visiting Monarch. But if one takes the tone of the French press, he is impressed with fair and restrained comments, predicting closer relations and better feelings between the two nations. We have been so busy with our own thoughts that I did not dream of the coming of the Spanish King to Paris. I read something in the papers but I did not give attention to dates; even early this morning the hotel man entered my room with several Flags to hung them in front and on the side of the building. I did not asked him any question, having in mind the feast of Joan of Arc which was celebrated a day or two ago. I thought to myself this must be the continuation of that Feast. It was a fair day with sunshine rolling down from the blue sky; the air was wedded to a wee-bit of gentle breeze just to show us what constitutes an ideal May day in Paris. It is 9 o'clock in the {{p3}} morning. As he has been doing for the last few days, the Master called me again to go out with him and have a walk. I jumped up from my seat and was ready in no time. We were walking along the avenue Kleber toward the "Arc de Truimphe" when suddenly we heard the sound of Martial music. Through one of the cross streets a regiment of soldiers were walking with military steps toward the Champ Elysee. The Beloved stopped on the sidewalk and reviewed the whole regiment. As the soldiers passed by they all looked at him and if they only knew that they are being reviewed by the Supreme heavenly Commander of the Kingdom of God they would have gladly given up their lives with joy and happiness. We continued towards the Arc de Triumphe. The large square was filled with soldiers and {{p4}} artillery. No one was allowed to enter the circle; a cordon of soldiers preventing entrance. We walked toward champs Elysee and from end to the other we could see nothing but crowds, the spectators by hundreds of thousands lined behind the French soldiers on the sidewalks.

At last we got a place where we could see the King passing. President Poincari with members of Cabinet, military generals etc. are welcoming him at the station of Bois de Boulogne at 10:10 am and escort him to the Palace. From where we stood we could see the paints of the thousands of rifles and the head gear and cuirasses of the soldiers, shining and dazzling in the sun. It was indeed a spectacular sight which I will not easily forget. As the Master looked upon this seemingly victorious army he said: The wise man sees that another army with no cannons or rifles but with quiet other armaments shall defeat this army. The day is coming when all these armies and regiments are vanquished {{p5}} by the ever - victorious armies of the Kingdom of Abha and theirs shall be the glorious triumphs of Peace and brotherhood. When we arrived in Bagdad, one day there was a great maneuovers of the Turkish army corps and as Baha-wllah looked upon them said. My army shall win the eternal victories. These shall be put to rout and defeated!

The Beloved was interested in the artillery and watched it for a long time. Suddenly we observed all the eyes were looking up. It was large balloon floating calmly through the air. It came and stood high in the middle of the Champs Elysee. It was a beautiful sight! Someone remarked jokingly that it would set at nought all the precautions of the Police if just at right time a bomb was thrown down from the balloon.

{{p6}}

The Master apropos of marksmanship said: When I was young they would light ten candles and at the range of a very long distance I would put out the lights one after another without missing one.

The time for the arrival of the King approached. Notice was given to all the soldiers and everybody was ready. A regiment of the French guards riding on five horses passed by and the King with the President of Republic sitting side by side in the state carriage came to view. The people hurrahed and cheered and the King smiled and made graceful acknowledgement. Oh! If only they knew that the King of Kings was standing so near to them. What would have they done? How blind and negligent are the people! They do not approach the real King but they run after these children's plays. They do not open their eyes to the glories of the Kingdom but they prefer darkness. Oh! And I wanted to get up and cry out oh people! Here is your King! Here is your divine Master! Here stands the life-giver of the world! Turn to him! This will be conducive {{p7}} to your everlasting honor!

When we returned to our hotel on our way we found a funeral procession waiting for the other procession to end. It was such a contrast of life and death. The hearse was covered with beautiful wreathes and garlands of flowers. As ever, he looked at the bright side of this contrast and said: This is a very lovely custom to cover the hearse with bouquets of all kinds of flowers. It is very beautiful.


As we reached the hotel we found a number of people waiting patiently for the Master. There was a Bahai who has been taught by Mrs. May Maxwell and another by Mr. Woodcock. The Master praised both these illumined souls and then said: Some souls are like unto the glass-chimneys. They are pure and transparent but an outside light must come in and illumined them; still there are others who are illumined but they do not confer illumination; again these are some people who are {{p8}} illumined themselves and they also illumine others. These are the blessed souls. These are favored in the Kingdom of Abha! When we associate with such real educators who confer general instruction upon the world of humanity and guide them in the path of Reality, day unto day our eyes are more illumined, our ears more hearing and our hearts more perfumed with the Fragrances of God.

To a young girl from Scotland who is studying painting in Paris he said: His Holiness Baha-wllah has commanded the study of arts and crafts; that when we undertake the study of any branch of arts we must perfect ourselves in it and strive to master its technicalities and expressions but the study of art must not hinder the enfoldment of the sweet flowers of our spiritual life. One must become a compliment to the other. Art without the subtle music of the spirit which is only heard by the still small voice; art without the spiritual inspiration of the higher spheres; art without the infinite waves and vibrations of the super-human; art without the tender messages of the anemones and hyacinths of the spiritual rose-garden is not art but artifice. {{p9}} Therefore you must make an effort to master both branches of Art.

The prophets of God who are the Masters of the spiritual art school teach men how to paint on the canvas of the spirits, the ideal images and virtues of the world of humanity. From time to time these masterpieces are exhibited in the wonderful Gallery of Sacrifice - on the Mount of divine Transfiguration. There and only there you are allowed to witness these life-like dramatic exhibitions. It is a marvellous gallery! The Principal of this Gallery today is Baha-wllah and up to this time more than 20000 portraits have been painted. Would you like to see these tragic, and dramatic life-size portraits?

Without any notice on our part he changed his topic and continued: When Baha-wllah appeared, the moral {{p10}} life of the people was degraded, they were not living like unto human beings. There was no trace of love, sincerity and good-fellowship but through his Teachings, the Fragrances of God were diffused, people were educated to such an extent that a child of 12 years old while under the sword cried out "Ya Baha El Abha". You must likewise strive to become more perfect day unto day. His Holiness the Bab has said, a believer must review his deeds every evening to see what has he done and accomplished during the day. If he has done something worthy and noble, if his spiritual susceptibilities are increased he must be thankful to God; if not, repent and try to live a better life tomorrow.


Mr. and Mrs. Scott entered the room. They were welcome and thus addressed: You are the flowers of Paris and the cause of my happiness. All the inhabitants of this city are either thinking of industry or wealth as they are chasing after the worldly pleasures except the few Bahais who are thinking of God. In a very large impenetrable jungle we have found a few fruit-bearing trees; therefore you are very much loved. When we were exiled from Teheran to Bagdad {{p11}} although we were one month on the way, we did not find a single Bahai and upon our arrival in Bagdad we found only three friends; notwithstanding this we were made very happy. The other day I desired to come to your meeting but I was not feeling well. Your meetings are very spiritual. They will progress in the future. Do not look at the present. The greatest meeting held during the day of Christ was the Lord's Supper. There were only twelve. The meeting was held in a very humble quarter with no table, no chairs and no rugs. They sat around a simple wooden board and spoke on the glad-tidings of the Kingdom. Now consider the results of that one supper. One end of the Christ's table is in the East, the other is in the West and many nations and tongues are sitting around it!

{{p12}}

To Mrs. Ethel Fraser the Master said: When thou art returning to Johannesberg thou must be like an eloquent, living letter. There are two kinds of letters, living and lifeless. I desire that thou mayst become a living, detailed, eloquent letter. A letter which is the cause of eternal life, a letter which confers happiness, a letter which illumine the hearts, a letter which spreads the message of the Kingdom of Abha, a letter which contains ideal significances, a letter which is the embodiment of deeds and not words, a letter which cries out and is not silent, in short a letter of Reality and light, a letter out of the Book of Life. Convey to all the friends the wonderful Abha greeting on my behalf. Be thou to them my eloquent, living and spiritual letters. Then he gave another wonderful talk on the Bounties of Baha-wllah who through his supernatural power has cemented these hearts together; that he has established such a union that even a sword cannot divide us.

{{p13}} 

In the afternoon Mr. Arnold William Rosenthal, the Editorial Foreign Correspondent of Pittsburgh Spectator with a friend of his called on the Master to get an interview for his paper. As the Beloved was asleep I spoke to him about the Cause and when he got up there issued between them the longest interview I have ever experienced. As I look over the Persian notes of Mirza Mahmoud I see there are about 8 pages rapid handwriting. Mr. Rosenthal wrote down everything and on his return to America which will be about the end of this month he will publish the article. I have given him Mr. Roy Wilhelm's address so that he may call on him when in N.Y. He is leaving for N.Y. on S.S. Martha Washington on May 24th. Please notify Mr. Wilhelm about this man. He was very {{p14}} favorably impressed with the Master and will write an excellent article. He begged the Beloved to write also a Tablet for the readers of the Spectators which he has promised to do tomorrow. It will be mailed to him.

After this long and most interested interview the Master told me to go and get a carriage and have a drive with him. We drove through the Bais de Bologne, Champs Elysee, the Garden of Tuilleries, on the Quai for 2 hours. He told me many interesting stories about Jazzar Pasha, the defender of the Fortress of Acca at the time of Napoleon the Great, the ideas of Napoleon about the formation of an Eastern Empire and how he was unhappy by the defeat he got from the hand of the valiant Jazzar Pasha. Returning home, there were several Persians and the discussions were turn upon the founders of the Present dynasty of the Persian Kings. The history of several of them was recited. It was a Feast of Persian history. What a marvellous memory the Master has! It is a divine, heavenly memory! I can write 30 pages more but I have no more time.



### BALTIMORE HOTEL 88 BIS, AVENUE KLEBER. May 8th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

The months of May and June are most beautiful and wonderful in Paris. People from many parts of the world come here to spent these two months in pleasure and merry-making. Every means of enjoyments is available and nature and all its ravishing beauty and luxuriance adds its charm and attraction. The very word "Paris" conjures before one's eyes certain types of amusements and attractions that cannot be found anywhere else on the face of the earth. Paris is a magical garden which draws within its sphere people from all parts of the world. Just at this time Bais de Bologne is an Elysian field of loveliness. "Les Jardins des Tuilleries" are visions of Paradise. The fine Parks have clad themselves with garments of luxuriant verdancy. The ever-shifting scenes {{p2}} of nature call the people out of their holes into the open space to bask under the sunshine and to breathe in the vital air, pure and limpid.

The other day someone inquired whether I have seen such and such a garden. I answered "No". "Why?" he asked. Because I rejoiced here I have the most beautiful garden. When I have the love of Abdul Baha I am in the rose-garden of God. When I hear his words I am listening to the most sweet singing nightingale. When I am in his Presence I am inhaling the Fragrances of the Ideal Flowers. If I stay with him in a cell it is delectable paradise. He is my rose-garden!

"Are you going to have a vacation this summer?" a friend asked. "What do I want to do with vacation!" I said. "When I am with our Beloved I am enjoying an eternal holiday. Once I did not go out of the hotel for 5 days but I was very happy because I was with him. Whenever I get tired I looked into his face and lo! I am refreshed! To served him and to be near him is my greatest hope! It is better to be the servant of Abdul Baha than the King of the World! Servitude at his Threshold is greater {{p3}} than the sovereignty of an empire. To win the good-pleasure of Abdul Baha through the sincerity of purpose and the devotion of the spirit is to win the good-pleasure of God. To possess his love, to feel the throles of his pulsating heart is the greatest privilege in life!"

This morning Mirza Jalal and Rezwanich Khanom came to say goodbye to the Master, because their train was leaving at 9 o'clock. Rezwanich during her stay of nearly 50 days in Paris has been the guest of Miss Sanderson. The Master thanked her for entertaining so beautifully Rezwanich. When she arrives home, the Beloved said, she will speak all the time about you and your hospitality. There are two kinds of love. Divine love which is eternal and lasting and a love which is {{p4}} born through acquaintance and is soon forgotten. Divine love is an eternal foundation not subject to ruin. Now there is divine love between you two sisters of the East and the West. Mirza Jalal will return after 3 weeks to take back his wife and I am wondering whether the Master will start here till his return.

Mrs. Ethel Fraser was also going to leave for London where she is going to stay the rest of the year before leaving for Johannesburg. She came in about half past nine to say goodbye to the Master. She was welcomed and thus addressed by the King of Kings: Convey on my behalf the wonderful Abha greeting to the believers in London. Own ounce to them the uninterrupted assistance of the Holy Spirit. Confer upon them the Supreme glad tidings of the Manifestation of Baha-wllah which are descending from His invisible Kingdom. They bestow health to the sick, happiness to the sorrowful, exhilaration to the downeast, hope to the hopeless and life to the dead one. Praise be to God that the Sun of Reality is shining upon all the regions, the divine Bestowals are all-enriching, the doors of the Kingdom are open, {{p5}} the call of Ya Baha El Abha is being raised from the East and the West. Now it is the beginning of the dawn of this light in the West. I hope that the East and the West may become submerged in the ocean of these heavenly effulgences. I am very pleased with the Believers of London for they heard the divine Call of Baha-wllah. Their meetings are warm and I hope that day unto day they may become warmer and more perfect, day unto day they may be drawn nearer unto God, day unto day they may become more spiritual, day unto day they may become more assisted and confirmed. I will pray for you also and beg for you confirmations from Threshold of Baha-wllah. Rest assured! God-willing you will become the means of conferring life upon dead. {{p6}} This is the most great affair today. I pray that you may be assisted with the Cohorts of the Angels of heaven. Rest assured! Rest assured! My heart will be with you. My spirit will be with you! My soul will be with you and I will never forget you.

Mrs. Fraser asked the Master's prayer for her father who is a very old man living at this time in Oakland California. The Beloved said: I will pray for him, that God may submerge him in the ocean of his blessings, and day unto day he may be drawn nearer unto the source of all Life. When the fruit is good the tree is also endeared in our eyes. You are his daughter and the fruit of the tree of his life. Your love for him cause you to mention his name and we have prayed for him. Other matters about the spread of the Cause in South Africa was touched and the Master told her to teach this Cause and spread its glorious glad-tidings. She went away with happy heart, confident spirit and soaring hope. We were all glad to make her acquaintance. She was a sweet, unselfish good Bahai. May god be with her wherever she goes!

{{p7}}

Several Bahais came and the Master spoke about his stay in San Francisco, and his meeting with a Japanese poet who had married an American girl. This Japanese poet became so attracted to the Cause as to write a poem, to deliver lectures and write articles in the local Japanese papers while Abdul Baha were there. He praised the Japanese intelligence and adaptability. He said: When the confirmations of God descend the distance of one hundred years is covered in one night. Then he gave the graphic life story of "Rouhallah Vargha", twelve years old, a martyr at that tender age. When he was in Acca, with his father I asked him one day. Tell me Rouhallah! What is the greatest desire of thy life? Immediately he answered! I long martyrdom in the path of God. Again I asked him: 'Why do you believe in {{p8}} the religion of Baha-wllah?' He answered. 'Because I have investigated it for myself. I am not a Bahai, because my father is one, but because I have thoroughly investigated it!'

Then he said: Man must never get satisfied. He must ever be thirsty. There is nothing worse in this world than satisfy. Man must drink from every fountain. His Holiness Baha-wllah says: 'Your thirst must be so great that if you quaff the seven seas of the world you may yet be thirsty and dry.

To a friend who just entered the room he said: God has created in you a great capability. You must expend this capability in the Cause of the Kingdom. If you consecrate it to any other cause except the promotion of the virtues of the world of humanity, its results will be finite. If you devote it to the spread of the Teachings of God and self-sacrifice in the path of God you will become like a bright candle. Just think that Peter and other apostles of Christ belonged to the common people and were not educated but as they expended whatever capacity they had in the path of {{p9}} Christ and they shone forth from the horizon of eternity. The results of the dedication of their lives to the Cause of Christ are yet continued. This Mary Magdelaine in whose name they have built a most wonderful Church in Paris was a peasant girl. As she dedicated her simple capacity to the Cause of Christ, she became well-known throughout all ages. Therefore strive that thou mayst spend thy capacity in the Cause of God.

Speaking about the coming together of the friends he said: The meetings of the friends are like unto the delightful rose-gardens in which you find variegated flowers adding to each other's charm. It is evident that when the intellectual forces of the minds are joined, the result will be correspondingly greater. Likewise the spirit of men do reinforce and strengthen each other. If man does not receive spiritual assistance {{p10}} from others his spirit will become weakened. The believers of God must reinforce each other's spirits, sacrifice their lives in the path of each other so that through their mutual assistance, the utmost of unity be obtained. The shop of one flock must gather together and do not let anything cause dispersion amongst them.

There was a musical artist in the room and the discussion was turned upon that subject. The Beloved spoke as follow: Music was an ancient art in Persia. The old People of Persia loved music very much and their artists contributed to its development. When the Arabs conquered Persia after the appearance of Mohamad, they learned from the Persians the notes and measures and brought back with them to Bagdad, the seat of Arabian Kalifott of the time. The Persian Music had rich and various harmonies known by the names of the cities, because every city had a different school of singing and they taught their artists, the special harmony which belonged to themselves. Persian music became very much in vague in Bagdad and its fame was spread far and wide. From Bagdad the Arabs carried {{p11}} it to Cordova and Andalusia in Spain, where they had their universities. Here many Europeans students studied the Persian school of music and made it as a foundation for their further and more original compositions. Thus Persian Music has contributed to European Music, although this is not quite well-known. Besides these historical testimonies the word "Music" is Persian. It comes from "Musik" and the word "Musik" comes from the word "Musighar", a sweet singing bird. The beak of this bird is so made as to contain many holes and as it respires, various and different sounds issue from its hole, thus making a combination of pleasant sounds.

The first musician of Persia was Barbad who lived about 2000 years ago. He was the first man who translated these pleasant {{p12}} sounds into the voice of man. He divided the music into twelve measures giving to each measure a particular name. He became famous and well-known for his great service to the musical world. The second musical genius of Persia was "Faraby" who lived 1000 years ago and invented the musical notes. The Europeans claim that they are the ones who originated the notes but the book of "Faraby" was found in the Arabian Library of Spain and sets and nought such a claim. Faraby taught music to his pupil by the motion of his hands. For example the right hand was taken as the "harmony" and the left hand the "measures". When the pupil came to him for a lesson he would sit on a chair and move his right or left hand, the pupil ever following those motions. There is a story in connection with the life of "Barbad" and his struggle to get royal recognition that I would like to tell you. When he invented the twelve measures of music he was a poor bard {{p13}} and no one knew anything about him. He tried every means to reach the royal Court and play for the King but he failed every time; the court Musicians even blockading his way. They feared his talent. Finally he eluded them one night and entered the Imperial Park; hiding himself under the bushes till long after midnight. Then slowly he crept out and walked toward the Palace where the King was sleeping. He spied a tall tree near the King's apartment and ascended to the top. He carried along of course the musical instrument invented by himself. About dawn he began to play and sing and little by little he added to the richness and volume of his voice till it filled the whole Park. The King was awakened out of his sleep, his heart enraptured with the sweet music. He came out of his apartment with several Courtiers who were also {{p14}} awakened and together they started a search for the Artist. They were at last brought under the tree on the top of which "Barbad" was filling the space with his ethereal voice. The King and the Courtiers thought an angel had come down from heaven. At last they asked him "Art thou human or divine?" He said "I am Barbad". "Come down then!" He came down. "Why did you go on the top of this tree to sing?" The King asked. "Because your court musicians through jealousy did not let me have an audience with my King, therefore finding no other way and being determined to sing for you I decided to follow this plan." The King was most pleased with him and kept him ever afterward with himself.

The Beloved went out for a walk and on his return he ate with us at the table in the general dining room. Mon. Dreyfus called and talked with him about various subjects such as the present visit of the King of Spain to {{p15}} Paris. In this instance he recited a story about the visit of one of the Western Rulers to Constantinople and how he was lavishly entertained by the Sultan of Turkey. Apropos of something he said: I am always thinking how to carry the loads of others and not to put my own loads on their shoulders. The Blessed Perfection has taught me this. We must prove this. We must prove this through deed and not by mere word. Ahmad Pasha called and for one hour he was in the Presence of Our Beloved. His father has been a great admirer of Baha-wllah when he lived in Adrianople. Abdul Baha gave him today one of his large photos and a copy of Asiatic Review. {{p16}} With Doctor Mohamad Khan, he went out to take a walk, calling at the same time on Mon. Dreyfus and Miss Sanderson.

Ahmad Pasha had prepared for the Master bottles of sour milk. As he was living near us I went and got there. The Master had just arrived and they were on the table. He sent to the dining room all the Persians to take their lunch and as I was not hungry I stayed in my room. The Master instead of asking me to take a bottle of sour milk for the Persians, he took it himself. The diners were surprised to see Abdul Baha entering the dining room and carrying in his hand a bottle of milk for his secretary. Is not this really wonderful? Why did he not asked me to do this except to teach us the lesson of true servitude? Is there any other way for us to show our deep appreciation for all that he is doing for us than he ever ready to sacrifice our lives in his path?

To the believers of God and the maid servants of the Merciful!

Upon them be Baha-o-llah El Abha!

Stuttgart and Esslingen.

He is God!

Ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!

The Stuttgart days! How happy were they! The meetings! How illumined were they! The heavenly confirmations! How manifest were they! The Breaths of the Holy Spirit! How were they set in motion! The Call of the Kingdom of Abha! How did it ascended the apex of the Supreme Concourse! Whenever the hours spent in Stuttgart are remembered, the soul and the heart are made happy!

Blessed is the Lord of Hosts who in that country appraised the summon of the Kingdom, strived the hearts with spiritual susceptibilities, gladdened the souls and rejoiced the spirits with {{p20}} the divine glad-tidings. I hope that the Confirmations of Baha-ollah may descend upon you uninterruptedly, every moment may you receive a new spirit so that the Kingdom of God may be spread very rapidly and the gospel of the appearance of Baha-ollah may resuscitate all the regions. The Days that I lived in your midst were spiritual and illumined. The heavenly food descended, the eternal bestowal was unveiled, the emotions of consciousness were incessant, the eyes were radiant and the ears were listening with the utmost exhilaration to the celestial song. I beg of God to make this confirmation continual and the reality of the teachings of His Holiness Baha-ollah may become incarnated thus the hearts may become attracted and the souls quickened through the Breaths of the Holy Spirit.

Dear Harriet!

As the Beloved come out of his room this morning he said: All the people are sleeping! Why are they so negligent and neglectful of the glorious destiny which His Holiness Baha-wllah has appointed for them? The time has come when they must turn their faces toward the Kingdom of Abha; instead they are asleep upon the bed of unawareness. The Sun of Reality is in the height of its power and majesty but they prefer dark rooms and the light of the candles. The Bahais all over the world must awaken them with the trumpets of the Word of God. This is the time of real, active work! We must arise with great energy and fire to quicken the souls.

{{p2}}

This morning Mrs. Beede brought a French Melle whom she has taught two years ago and her interest has been kept up all this time. The Beloved talked with her a long time about the atheists and the religionists, the two most prominent schools in France and told her how she should speak with them. With one she should speak about nature and its defects, with the other about divine religion and the appearance of the Kingdom of Abha.

Later Mrs. Lilianthal arrived and she said to the Master that there was a bird near her window which sings very beautiful and its melody brought to her mind the lovely and heavenly disposition of the Beloved. He answered: My sweet-singing birds are your hearts, for they sing the song of the Kingdom. Through this I am made very happy. The twittering of the birds is good for some people but we have sharpened our ears to listen to the songs of the birds of Paradise. The rich notes of this melody is eternal. I love to hear the "Song of the Heart" which is streaming down from the Kingdom of Abha, stirring the hearts of men with {{p3}} deeper and purer emotions. Have you ever thought that the one heavenly song which issued from the sweet mouth of Christ found millions of echoes in the hearts of men and women throughout ages and cycles and has grown into thousand rich accompaniments? That was a real melody; all others were imitations. We must sing such a melody, the effect of which will be lasting. The songs of the birds are the result of the vibrations which are set in motion in the air. They reach the tympanum of our ears and are forgotten after a few minutes. If you hear continually the songs of the birds, you will be tired. This very thing happened in Montclair N. J. When I was {{p4}} there, there were so many birds that the people did not know what to do. They complained to the local authority, because their sounds at nights disturbed their sleep. Now you must think of the Melody of the Kingdom and that is the Call of God.

There is a station destined for man that if he ever reaches to it, he will find all the created phenomena holding conversation with him; he will see that everything is speaking with him. For example, when he looks upon the Sun, it will speak with him addressing him in the most eloquent language as follow: O Son of Man! Behold! How light is good! I am a body composed of mineral elements! There is no importance in the mineral but as I am as a light-giving body, I am educating the whole world. I am developing all the minerals in the bowels of the earth. I am the cause of all these luxuriant vegetations. I am the means {{p5}} of the continuation of life in the animal and human kingdoms. I render all these services because I am an illumined body. Therefore, O thou man! Strive that thou mayst likewise became enlightened, thus becoming the means of general education and the upliftment of humanity.

Someone asked about the health of the Master. He answered: Under all circumstances, I am happy and well. I am never unwell. The body of man is the result of the composition of the elements and these elements are constantly at war with each other. They wage such a better war on each other that at last both sides come to defeat and disintegration. But the spirit of man is from the world of God. In the world of God {{p6}} there is no strife. It is a world of simplicity and absolute unity. There is no war and no alteration. There is absolute peace and pure reconciliation.

Then Mrs. Lilian that asked many questions about the theory of "electrical body" to which the Beloved gone quite lengthy answers. He went out with Mirza Hossein and walked for 2 hours, for the day was very fine. On his return we all had lunch in the dining room in his Holy Presence. He was in good humour and spoke jokingly about me all the time. At 3 o'clock Mon. Dreyfus came and the Master went with him to pay a visit to Rouha Khanom in the hospital.

During his absence Mr Lee {{p7}} and Miss Hadjson arrived and we had a long talk with them of how to spread the Cause more wildly in Paris. They were here when the Master came in. They asked the same question from him. He said: Every soul must first teach himself; he must be severed, attracted, enkindled; he must be living the life - then his words will have effect. Whenever you see a thirsty soul, give him a cup of this salubrious water. This Cause has cost us very dear. We have not received it cheaply. It is the pearl of the great price. The believers of God have accepted this Cause through self-sacrifice. {{p8}} They have given up their lives for it. They have accepted happily, chains and fetters in order to promote these Teachings.

Tonight we all went to Mon. Dreyfus' Meeting. The Master stayed home. Mr. Horace Holly read portion of his book on the Cause which is being published both in London and America. Mon. Dreyfus read a letter from Rezwanich Khanom on the necessity of the freedom for the women in the East. It was written before her departure. We are all very happy because the Master's health is much improved. This week of rest in Paris has done him lots of good. We do not yet know when he leaves for Egypt.

Dear Harriet!

A very wonderful Tablet containing a glorious Message of Peace and goodwill for all the American people was revealed yesterday for Pittsburgh Spectator. I have just finished translating it and am forwarding it to the Correspondent who had a long interview the other day and is now travelling in Europe. This Tablet with its original Persian will appear probably in the month of June in a daily or Sunday edition. Both the interview and the Tablet are unique, instructive and brilliant. If the correspondent who was most sympathetic write everything that was given to him, it will be one of the best articles of the year.

{{p2}}

This morning a letter from Los Angeles was read to the Beloved. The news contained therein about the meetings made the Master very happy. He said: Consider the Power of the Covenant! Where is Acca and where is Los Angeles! Yet the Power of the Covenant of Baha-wllah has united these two distant points! As people in Southern California are religious, the Cause shall advance there, and many people will become attracted and the Word of God will be promoted. In order to preserve the unity of the Cause and to spread the religion of God Baha-wllah established this Covenant and Testament. Were it not for the power of the Covenant, you would have witnessed the dispersion of the believers and the total disappearance of the Cause of God. When I say the Covenant, I mean the power and the authority of Baha-wllah given to me. In this station the consideration of sonship and fatherhood is forgotten. Baha-wllah did not appoint {{p3}} Abdul Baha as the Center of His Covenant because he was his son but because he was the purest and the readiest channel on the face of the earth to carry on this work. The believers must realize that the Power of the Covenant is for the protection of the Cause of God, the promulgation of the religion of God and the brotherhood of the East and the West.

About 9 o'clock Mon. Richard arrived and the Master took him to his room. He spoke about the ideal freedom of the Persian Bahai women, how they are being educated and the new ideals spread amongst them. Their hearts and consciences are free. They move in a calm, spiritual atmosphere. Their intuitions are developed very marvellously. They have received {{p4}} the moral and ethical education. Baha-wllah has made the Oriental women free from the fetters of bondage and captivity. They are the equals of men. Man and wife are partners and life companions and not master and slave. Of course the progress of one fundamental law must not be lost sight of and that is this the complete intellectual freedom and social and civic equality of women in Oriental countries must come about by intelligent, normal evolution and not in a haphazard abnormal revolution. The men are cooperating with their sisters to open schools for girls and introduce scientific courses for their instructions. All this will take time and continued vigilance and activity. The Bahais are doing everything in their power to further these high ideals and the authorities of the School of Tarbiat in Teheran have opened a girl's school and have an American teacher. The future of the Oriental women is bright but she is now in a period of transition. {{p5}} She is trying to discard the old, archaic garments and putting on the new and modern garments of spiritual and intellectual thoughts. She is striving. She is looking forward. She is searching for the new light. Valiantly she is going ahead and at every step she is removing her path new and unexpected stumbling-blocks thus she is paving the road for her sisters yet unborn. With the lantern of Baha-wllah in her hand, fearlessly she walks abroad while the night of ignorance is inky dark; the winds of prejudices howling; the hobgoblins of illiteracy intimidating; the fanaticism of the Mullahs surging; the nightmare of unexpected attacks growling; the powers of darkness surrounding and oriental nugatery staring {{p6}} in the eyes. But our "New Oriental Woman" like unto her "new occidental sister" has seen the light and her star-like destiny. With unwavering courage and indomitable energy she has resolved to reach her glorious destination and no power can stop her from achieving her exalted mission of ideal and practical emancipation. It is very clear that in the immediate future woman shall play a great role in the progress of civilization. There is a surging unrest in the woman's world. The seed of the new ideals which have been sown in the soil of their hearts are beginning to push out their tender heads and soon they will grow and develop and produce luscious fruits. We are at the most interesting period of woman's development. While they are acquiring virtues, studying sciences, equipping themselves with artistic careers and entering upon the field of active work, the old foundations are tottering, the old earth is passing away and the new heaven appearing. May the stars of this new heaven increase daily in number and in brilliancy.

{{p7}}

The difference between the Sufi system of thought and the Bahai revelation was dwelt on by the Master in detail in the most clear and logical manner. He quoted the philosophic apothegms of the Sufi leaders stating that the Sufi idea about God is pantheistic. The one supreme essence individualizing itself in all the succession of phenomena. One of them says: The creatures are as a mass of congealed ice, but God - the essence of God is the water. When the ice is thawed down - or when we shuffle off this mortal coil - it will become part of the water again. Another Sufi poet says: The sea - God - has been from time immemorial and is eternal but these contingencies and creatures are the waves and the ripples the reef.

{{p8}}

Another celebrated Sufi poet "Altar" portrays this idea of pantheism in a long wonderful poem called the "Parliament of Birds". The poem is written allegorically. It is said that "Hodhod", a very beautiful bird came one day to all the other birds and said, let us all gather together and make a pilgrimage to the mountain of "Gaff" - where the king of birds "Seymorg" dwells on a lofty peak. (Now "Seymorg" is a fabulous mythological bird in the ancient literature of Persia but it means literally 30 birds; "Sey" means 30, "Morg", bird.) Then "Hodhod" sent out messengers to all parts of the world to announce the approaching departure of the birds for the Mountain of "Gaff". Millions of birds joined the Caravan. At last they were ready and started on their long journey. They had to cross many waste deserts and many desolated valleys. They flew over many high mountains. For days they could get neither food nor water. {{p9}} Many of them died on the way and the rays of the Sun burned and scorched the wings and feathers of several thousand and they fell on the hot sand of the desert. Finally the large army was woefully decimated and only "30 birds" reached the mountain of "Gaff". Having attained to the summit, they did not find any "Seymorg" but looking around they saw they were the "Seymorg" themselves.

Now it is evident that the Sufis believe in two stations - God and creatures. They express this pantheism in the simile of the sea and the waves. This is the foundation of the school of the Sufi philosophy which runs under various aspects throughout {{p10}} all the higher structures of their idealism philosophically. They consider all the phenomena as parts and parcels of God but limited in their own influences. For example they say, this single wave is limited but the ocean in comparison to the single wave is unlimited, nevertheless, the wave is part of the sea. This will naturally bring them to the preposterous declaration that the Eternal will become accidental and the Powerful, the weak. They say that the reality of divinity descends into the world appearing and reappearing under infinite forms. But the Bahais say there is God, the creatures and the medium. They state that the Reality of Divinity is Absolute Independence; if it comes within the circle of Necessity, it is not Divinity; the Reality of Divinity is Absolute Perfection but the creatures are pure imperfection. Consequently there are channels between God and man. These channels are the Holy Divine Manifestations. In short the Beloved spoke more along these lofty thoughts and as Mon. Richard had studied the Sufi School, he was most delighted with this subtle exposition.

{{p11}}

Several friend entered with lovely bouquets of flowers. Amongst other things he said: I am very pleased with your meeting. I love those souls who are attracted and enkindled. As you are in this state, my heart is attracted to you. You must become like unto the flowers of fire. You must become as burning torches. You must teach the Truth. The more you are enkindled, the more you are set aglow with the Fire of the Love of God, and the more your holiness and sanctification, the lighter my load will it be. I have sown only one seed in Paris. Now you must irrigate it till it becomes a great harvest. You must be good farmers, spiritual scientific farmers. {{p12}} Tablet (Erased part) Bahais. Many (erased part) and he spoke to them for a long while. At five Mon. Dreyfus called and he went out with him to meet his mother. On his return he took me with himself to call on Rashid Pasha, the former governor of Syria. Here after talking on the current misfortunes of Turkey, he told the Pasha about his experiences in Calif, his lectures before various Societies and more interesting than anything else the accumulative incidents which led him to take the long trip to Calif and meet the friends there. The Pasha said: "This has been a great service to the world". Abdul Baha replied: This was through the Confirmations of God, otherwise I could not take such as long and arduous journey. I have done my duty. Now may God create the effect. We returned home and as there were present a few of the Persians the name of Prof. E. G. Browne was mentioned and he became the subject of discussion and his relation to the Bahai Cause.

Dear Harriet! 

The more one sits at the feet of the Master, the more one hears his wisdom and his Knowledge; the more one observes his godlike patience, the more one becomes in touch with his fire and enthusiasm; the more one realizes his infinite variety of experiences, the more one is charmed with the eloquence of his words, the directness of his appeal, the attraction of his smile, and the brilliancy of his ideals, the greater is one's admiration and wonder. How he wields the mighty sword of love, gaining fresh and new victories every day! How he makes happy those who are sorrowful! How he surrounds us with an atmosphere of spirituality! How he encourages us through the valley of distress and {{p2}} disappointment! How he inspires us when we are broken-winged! How he prays for us in the middle of nights! How he reveals to us the secret of power and success! How he shields us from all the errors of judgment! He is the unerring mind, the seeing heart, the hearing ear!

The sun rises in Paris very early and we get up with the seen, often about 4:30 and seldom later than 5'oclock. Thus we have 3 to 4 quiet hours without anyone calling upon us. Paris is differently constituted and we are not early callers like America. In fact the Master has addressed no meeting since his return from Germany; he has of course spoken informally to different groups gathered in his reception room in the hotel. These talks in a way reveal more of the Beloved to us, because they are the unconscious outpourings of his divine mind and heart. He has not been called upon to make any exertion. Naturally and beautifully a number of his devoted followers gather around him everyday- just as children gather around their dear father - and listen with rapt attention to his {{p3}} advices and heavenly Counsels. Around the Master there is an invisible, ineffable reality. You feel "at home" as soon as you enter his Presence. You may have had audience with all the emperors and Kings of the world, you may have spoken with all thinkers and philosophers of the age, you may have met all the spiritual lights of this century but as soon as you are in the Presence of Abdul Baha, you feel you are before a cyclonic force of spirituality not a man, not an extraordinary man, not even a miraculous man, but a superman. His spirit immediately captivates you, you are made a prisoner, you struggle to wave inside this influence but you are a captives, a prison, a bird in the cogent of his love to a freedman! You shall know the truth and the truth shall make {{p4}} you free. You have witnessed the truth face to face. Now you are really liberated. You are soaring in the immensity of the Love of God; You are travelling in the highroad of the Kingdom, you are up hold by a new power, you are inspired by a heavenly Presence. Nothing now, mothers! "Let me serve my fellowman" you say to yourself!" Let me go out and spread these principles amongst mankind! Let me decided myself to the Cause of universal Peace. I have no other ambition, no other thought except this. I have seen at last the Light that illumines the world of humanity! I have quaffed from the solubrious fountain of life. I have partaken of the heavenly Food. I feel the motion of new waves on the marmoreal sea of my existence. I witness the quick whir and stir of new ideals in the unseen chambers of my heart. O observe the wafting of divine breezes through the interlaced branches of the tree of my being!" Thus you address yourself when you leave the Presence of Abdul Baha, praying to God to assist you in the fulfillment of these pledges! {{p5}} This morning the Beloved spoke to us on "how the countenance is the mirror of the heart." He said: If y     u have the perception power, as soon as you look in the faces of the people, you can observe what ideals are reigning in their hearts. The other day I walked through the oneness but did not find one face reflecting the spiritual ideals of the heart. In American it was different. Mighty thoughts of philanthropy and illumined ideals of humanitarianism are set in motion and you find their reflections in the faces, because they were lodged in the hearts. One woman told me, she was working day and night to abolish the law of capital punishment; another person told me she desired to have a uniform inter-state divorce law; a third was devoting his time {{p6}} to the betterment of the conditions of criminals in the penitentiaries and the abolishes of capital punishment; another one was trying to introduce a new system of education etc etc. I found these noble ideals have permeated throughout all the classes of America. Civilized and refining influences are work. Everyone was thinking in terms of progress, and upward march. In the strictest sense of the word, there was no reactionary movement in America. What was called reactionary there will be radical progressions in other parts of the world.

In regard to answering the petitions which are received from the East and the West he said: " I read all of them but I have no time to send answer to each one. It is impossible. Some of the friends may think they are the only ones who write to me and so they wonder why they do not receive answers but it is simply beyond any human possibility to answer all the letters. The believers of God can write freely to Our Beloved at any time and under all circumstances but if they don't receive any answer; they must know he is praying for them and after all material correspondence is of n importance, and {{p7}} spiritual correspondence is continuous between them and the Master.

Mrs. Dreyfus brought for the master a very large bush of red roses. It is in the center of the salon. It is very beautiful and with the addiction of other flowers our room has become a symbol of the heart of Abdul Baha a rose-garden-very fragrant.

About 10 o'clock a number of the friends gathered in the room. The Master asked from Mr. Holly when his book will be out of print? He said, about 4 weeks. The Beloved got silent and then he spoke: I was thinking that during the days of Christ not one word was written about him. We have at the present time 4 Gospels, two of these were {{p8}} written 60 yrs. after Christ; but today there are ever so many books written on the Bahai Cause, proving its authority and greatness. In this day, the most useful books are those which demonstrate the validity of the Cause with logical proofs, intellectual evidences and spiritual arguments. In answer to a question put by Mr. Holly the Master said: In the spiritual mirror, the virtues of the world of humanity are visible. Just as the intellectual law unravels the mysteries of phenomena, similarly the spiritual law acquires the ideal principles of humanity. Just as in the world of nature there is the "survival of the fittest", likewise in the spiritual world there are the perfections of the divine realm. Just as order and peace are continued in a community through the strong hand of law, in the same manner the world of humanity exists through the acquirement of divine and spiritual virtues. The struggle for existence ensures the growth and development of the species; likewise the spiritual {{p9}} law secures the enfoldment and progress of the spirit.

In answer to another question he said: The Greatness prison is the material world. Prison is the antithesis of freedom. Now man is a prisoner of food, of sleep, of comfort and thousand other similar prisons. Therefore the material body of man is a prisoner of these things and he cannot fill himself from them. On the other hand, he is also a prisoner of greed, of rapacity, of tyro, of ill-feeling against others, of envy, of jealousy etc. He can free himself from these things. He is able to free his heart from the love of this world. He is able to release himself from anger, greed, ego, passion and all the vices of the material world. How {{p10}} is he enabled to free himself from these vices? He can render this service unto himself and then unto others through the influence of the Divine Law. The Divine Law warms man from falling precipices and frees him from the filters of self. Whereas formerly he was dark, he is made illumined. Whereas formerly he was limited, he becomes unlimited. Whereas formerly he was withered, he becomes enkindled. Whereas formerly he was blind, deaf and mute, he becomes seeing, hearing and the power of speech is given unto him. Whereas formerly he was dead, he becomes alive! This is the real freedom!

Someone asked about spiritual happiness. The Master answered: There are three paths through which man obtains spiritual happiness. The first path is the path of ordeals, trials and difficulties. His feet are torn with thorns and thistle, he goes through many pains and torments {{p11}} but finally he reaches his destination. The second path is a pleasant path but the traveller makes slow progress. He advances surely but slowly. Step by step he comes nearer and nearer to the goal. It may take many years but the persevering determined, cheerful traveller goes on and on. The third path is the path of faith. With one step the traveller finds himself in the Kingdom; even less than the twinkling of an eye the change is wrought. In one moment he travels from the world of negation into the world of affirmation. We have seen this with our own eyes. A man who has been the collective center of all the vices, having become a Bahai is changed completely in less than a second. He became another man. He entered a new world of light. 

{{p12}}

In answer to the questions of others he spoke in detail on the non-existence of Time and Space, a very wonderful explanation which will take several pages to translate. 

The last delights talk that I am going to translate here is "On the relative importance of the affairs of life." He said: Different things are considered by us as of absolute importance at various stages of our development. For example when we were children, we considered "plays" as of absolute importance but now that we are grown up more important matters engage our attention. A little tooth ache may be considered as of absolute importance to some, which giving our life itself is of no importance whatsoever in the estimation of others. The martyrs in this Cause gave up their lives rejoicing without any hesitation but if a finger is pricked with a thorn we run to the Doctor and are worried and anxious about it. When the doll is broken the little girl mourns and laments {{p13}} as though her living child was dead but when she grows up she may herself break the doll.

Someone asked about the feelings of the martyrs; whether they were conscious of any pain when they were tortured. The Beloved answered: Baha-ullah in one of his Tablets says, therefore I will explain for your benefit certain luminous and shining mysteries, wherely you will became so attracted toward the loftiest station as to forget completely the world and all that contains therein. Then you will feel only the Presence of the Almighty. If you reach to this station you will be in the station of abstraction and you will see nothing else except God. When living in this great station, if the enemies tear you to pieces, you do {{p14}} not feel the pain and suffering. This is the station of "submersion." It is as though man was submerged in the sea. He knows nothing of the outside conditions of life.

In short, the Beloved spoke on many subjects. Then he went out all alone and had a very long walk. In the afternoon many Persians came to see him and he kept them entertained with amusing stories of Acca life. I have seldom seen him enjoying himself so much. He spoke interrupted for several hours and he laughed and kept others laughing with humorous and funny stories. It was one of the few most enjoyable afternoons that we shall never forget. During these hours his humanity, his divine humor, his irresistible charm, his heavenly versatility, his inimitable loveliness, and his depth and breadth became more appreciated and better Known than any other occasions.

<15>

It is impossible to picture him when he is under the spell of these pleasant moods.

At eight o'clock in the evening a carriage was hired and he called me to his side we drove through Bois de Balogne and Chowps Elysees. Having received letters from New York, giving the details of the convention, he discussed a great deal on the subject, asking me questions about the contents of the letters. He will no doubt write one this subject directly to the friends. I can say thus much that he was pleased with the general reports of harmony and unity which existed during the sessions of the Convention as well as the Feasts which were held in {{p16}} the homes of the friends.

Speaking about his western trip and the spread of the divine principles through Europe and American he said: In the future there will arise many souls who will promulgate the Cause of God but it was always my supreme desire to accomplish this service myself, to cry the word of ya Baha El Abha in all the gatherings and to attract all the people to the Kingdom of the Blessed Perfection. Praise be to God that I have performed my duty!

Future generations will receive comfort inspiration from the words and deeds of Abdul Baha for he is the inspirer of the hearts. Through him we are enabled to accomplish any task. With his encouragement we can achieve divine victories and crown our life with spiritual success. His good-pleasure is of a value greater than all the gold of the earth; he is more faithful and loving than all the inhabitants of the globe. His love is assuredness; his compassion all-encircling; his benevolence incomparable.

{{p2}}

Every day I am more than we thankful in these permitting me to be with him and to receive the gracious joy of his Presence. Words are such poor vehicles to express the emotions of the heart. What I do is so less little less than nothing compared to what my heart wishes to do. 

To drink tea with the Master is to drink the nectar of life. How sweet his voice sounds when he calls us every morning no sooner tea is set before him by the ever faithful Sayad Assadullah: Mirza Ahmad, Mirza Mahmaud, Come and have tea! Then we enter his room. He pours tea with his own hand, offering us the cup, and speaking according to his pleasure.

He said a proposal of a suggestion: This cannot be done. In everything I must use a thousand considerations. Even when I breathe, I must first think, whether I should breathe on the right or on the left.

A few of the friends came in. One of them know Mrs. Stannard who is now living in Egypt and serving the Cause of God. The Master praised her activities in the Movement. He said: She has dedicated her life to the service of the world of humanity. She has no other thought except this. She works very faithfully. When I lived in Alexandria I could see her almost daily doing her work most sincerly.

He spoke about the   believers in Germany; he showed their {{p4}} pictures to the friends who were present and said that their faces were illumined, their faith is strong and their future assured! 

There was a friend in the meeting from Scat-land and the Beloved addressing her said: We have many friends in Scotland; many devoted friends; amongst them is Mrs. Whyte. I was most pleased with my visit to that country. Scotland weather is very invigorating. The City of Edinborgh is beautiful and its inhabitants progressive and deeply religious. Thesis is firm and strong character. They are thirsty for spiritual water. They are not dogmatic but they feel a heartfelt sincerity about their religion. This is good. They have a deep sense for spiritual ideals. While there, they asked me many questions; and several large meetings were organized and we delivered addresses. The people of Edinborgh are intelligent and critical. They investigate. They do not accept their questions were dignified and based upon a desire to learn.

{{p5}}

A meeting was held in Mrs. Whyte's house for the Oriental students. They were from China, Japan, Persia, India, Turkey, Syria, Arabia, etc. It was a wonderful demonstration of the universe of the East and of the West. These were strong, purposeful young men. Another meeting was organized by the Esperantists and one by the Theosophists. Both these meetings were marvelous. Mr. Page the Secretary of the Esperauto Association and Mr. Graham Paale, the General Secretary of the Theosophical Society was most intelligent and sympathetic. They were very kind and hospitable. In short I met many people in Edinborgh whom I shall never forget. There are certain souls whose thirst is never alloyed, while others are satisfied with one {{p6}} drop. The larger the vase the greater its capacity to hold water, but when the vase is small, there will be very little water in it. When his holiness Christ appeared, the Jews said: 'We have enough water in our vases. We do not need the fountain of Christ. We have been blessed with many prophets during the Jewish history. These prophets have been the divine Cup-bearers. We have quaffed the pure water from their hands. Are we going to run after this new spring? But those souls who were really blessed and glorious they drunk deeply from the fountain of Christ and yet were they thirsty, yet were they seeking. His Hahness Baha-ullah, says in one of his Tablets; if you drink all the seas of the earth there must be no sign of witness on your lips. You must be always thirsty for the water of significances. The more the circle of your information is widened, the greater must become your search. Only through this open attitude man will become {{p7}} perfect, but a soul whose cup is filled width a few drops will never become perfect.

He spoke on how Christ always spoke with his disciples in parables and gone in his own simple language the parable of the Feast and the imitations sent to all the great people and how each one gave an excuse for not being able to be present and how the Lord sent through the highways and byways to gather and bring the poor people. Also he gave the parable of the farmer and the sawing of the seeds on the rock, on the brackish ground and on the pure ground. All these illustrations show that capacity is necessary. We must plough the ground of our hearts so that the divine {{p8}} seeds may grow therein. In order to show that without capacity even the breaths of the holy Spirit will not assist related the following story: There is a story attributed to Christ in the oriental literature that is not found in any of four gospels. It is reported that our day a number of people saw Christ flying away with great haste. Thy asked him, why are you hurrying away? He did not give them any answer but continued to run. Finally they caught him in his flight and told him. Why this haste? Are you flying away from a lion or a panther or a leopard or a wolf or a bear? There are no such wild beasts in this vicinity and we do not see any reason for this precipitations flight! Then Christ said 'I am flying away from a fool.' They were astonished at this declaration. 'Are you not the Christ? Blow them the Power of the Holy Spirit over this fool man and, he will become wise. Christ said: "With the same breath {{p9}} of the Holy Spirit that I blew over the ignorant and he became lamed; the deaf found hearing; the blind seeing, the mute speaking, the sick became well and the dead received a new Life. I blew the same breath of the holy Spirit more than one thousand times over this fool and there was no result; consequently I am flying away from him.

Some one asked the meaning of the miracle of the five loaves, the twelve remains baskets and the feeding of the multitude. It answered : His holiness Christ said: I am the bread which has come down from heaven. Again he said: whosoever eats of this bread, he shall find a new life. The heavenly Food is the divine virtues of the world of humanity. {{p10}} In other word, he said: I am the infinite Bestowal; whosoever takes a good show of me he shall never die. It is evident that his holiness Christ was a pure channel for the diffusion of the Bounties of God amongst humanity. He was the one who spread these Bestowels. He made the fisherman the great Peter. We can understand these symbolic teachings better when we remember another saying of Christ: the Father is in me and I am in you. Now it is clear that the physical body of Christ was not in the apostles; nay rather they received from him the heavenly Bestowals. The sun shining upon the mirror and its disk heat and rays are reflected therein, so that mirror can truthfully claim; I am the sun. In other words, the Sun of Reality with all its characteristics was reflected upon the transparent mirror of Christ sliding before Christ were observes the mirrors of his disciples. Now by a process of radiation, the reflection of the Sun of Reality upon the mirror of Christ was in turn reflected upon the mirrors of the apostles.

{{p11}}

With this manifest explanation you can better understand the meaning of the verse: The father is in me and I am in you. In short the heavenly Food signifies divine perfections. The five loaves are the five stages of inner enfoldment; the second stage is spiritual illumination. The third stage is the prophet's experience; the fourth stage is the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the fifth stage is the Divine Bestowals. With these five loaves the multitude were fed and satisfied; but the 12 apostles were the twelve baskets which were "filled" with the heavenly Food- that is their hearts became the recipients {{p12}} of all the five stages of spiritual food, which the multitude were fed only on one or two Kinds. In the estimation of Christ, this material bread had no importance, but to spread the heavenly Table before the eyes of all the inhabitants of the earth was the most important. This material bread sustains us only from day to day but the heavenly food bestowals upon us eternal life. Therefore you must ever strive to cat of the divine bread in order to join the life everlasting. Do not seen after a drop of water but search after the illimitable sea. Let the spark go and draw light from the sun whose rays and beaten perpetual.

Another Bahai asked about the meaning of the miracle of wine performed at the marriage feast and the Master again gave a long exposition on the subject. 

In the afternoon Rasheed Pasha called and later several French Bahais. The Beloved spoke with them, in details on the awakening of the {{p13}} French people out of the slumber of spiritual tarpon. He gave them a powerful electrifying talk that had I time I would have translated it here but space does it allow. At five o'clock Mirza Fazlallah, the brother of Doctor Younoss Khan of Tlheran came to see the Master with his newly-wedded French wife. The Master greeted them cordially and with happiness radiating from his face: you are welcomed; you are welcome! I am most pleased with your marriage. For this is a marriage between the East and the West. The more inter-marriage between the Europeans, Americans and Persians the better for the world! I like to see intermarriages between the inhabitants of these parts of the world increasing. In our country whenever there is a long-standing {{p14}} feed between two tribes, in order to remove it they inter marry. In reality, it has a wonderful effect. In Persia there are many of the nomadie tribes who pass all their lives under the tent, in the open air. Often between two tribes there has existed enmity and hatred for many years. They have fought against each other; pillaged each other's project, and people were killed on both sides. Now if an outside disinterested influence came in and try to reconcile these two contending parties he will use the same old eternal rule. The son of the chief of one tribe will marry the daughter of the chief of the other tribe. Immediately enmity is changed into anxiety and hatred into love. This rule has been tried again and again and has not been found wanting! It has a great efficacy. Now that the Persians and the Americans, the Americans and the Persians, the Europeans and the Persians and the Persians and the Europeans have began to give daughters and sons into each other, I hope that the {{p15}} bond of affection and unity between the East and the West will be reinforced and spiritual communication many living them into closer relationships. May this union flood the unexplored regions of the hearts with the rays of the Love of God! May such happy events hasten the day of the oneness of the world of humanity! Every movements which increases love and affection amongst the children of men is a divine movement and any Cause creating alleviation or even ill-feeding is diabolic in origin. In reality the world of humanity is one family but these ignorant fellows have come and divided it into French and German, Austrian and Italian. Persia and Arabs etc. How sweet will it be to {{p16}} see the French marrying with the English the English with the German and Vega versa. This will be the means of a greater and more lasting unity, agreement and concord. God has created all the female. Therefore marriage is a divine and natural institute. There is no celibacy in the Bahai Cause. I am msot pleased with your union and I hope that in the utmost of Kindness, you shall live together the rest of your days. May you be ever happy and the means of comfort and joy be ever prepared for you. May God pour upon you His blessing and shower you with His benediction! You will be always under the shelter of the Almighty! And you will be encircled with his preservation.

After this in his company we called on His Excellency the Persian Ambassador. He talked on many subjects with him. This was also a rare accessories. On our return we took quite a walk through the various avenues, the Beloved ever teaching me and giving me heavenly lessons for the guidance of my future in the Cause.

This morning the Master sent me down town to attend to some business and it was long after noon when I return and found several believers in the room waiting their turn to be receive by here. I him. I heard his voice in my heart was glad. He was explaining to Mon. Dreyfus the Pathway of the disciples of Christ and how they sacrifice everything in order to promote his teachings!

Apropos of the contents of a letter just receive he said: In this Cause of God there is no secret doctrine or secret society or club or gathering. I want you to be impressed with {{p4}} the importance of this fact; that there is no secret doctrine in this Cause at all. If some secret gatherings are held or organized, they will harm the Cause more than benefit it. Even if the intentions of the present organizer of such secret societies are pure, it is not good. The door of the cause is open. No one must even harbor the idea of forming any secret Society in the Cause. This will be a detriment to the movement.

In the afternoon an English lady called and he spoke briefly on his trip in London, Liverpool, Clifton and Edinborgh and invited her to came again to the meetings.

The Persian Ambassador called on the Beloved and for a hour they talked with each other. It was about half past six when he called on Mrs. and Miss Sanderson. He again thanked them for their services tend hospitability intended {{p5}} to Rouha Khanour and Rezwaweli Khanour and stayed there for half an hour. He came out and for more than an hour we walked through the avenues. I followed him and he ever so kindly speaking on the Cause, on the principle of activity and self-sacrifice. Returning home he had his supper and returned to his room.

This was an American day. American must rejoice because the Eyes of the Beloved have turned toward that region. The words of wisdom like unto the white pearls fell from his golden lips. Many Tablets were revealed for the believers, each one a shining crown of the friends. If we could appreciate but dimly the heavenly valve of his Tablets we would soar with joy and happiness toward the apex of the everlasting glory. The only way we can show our appreciation is to arise with greater firmness and steadfastness and {{p2}} herald the coming of the Kingdom. If we continue to be firm in the Cause, God will surround us with His divine Blessings! Nothing on the face of the earth must shake our faith. Let us rise higher and higher! Backward? No indeed! Why should we look backward? Forward? Yes! Always forward, friends! The star of human brotherhood is shining ahead of us and not behind! The fountain of spiritual life is in front of us and not on our back! Which way our Beloved is looking? Are not his teachings ahead of time? Is he not telling us constantly to work for the day when justice and peace shall reign on the earth as it is in heaven. Let all the critics of the world distort the truth; the truth will become straight again. The moon shall not stop to shed its silvery beams upon the beautiful scenes calm night, because the dogs are barking. The {{p3}} precious jewels will not become crockeries, because someone through maliciousness calls them so. The cooling water gushing forth out of the breast of the mountain will not be considered as muddy because someone thinks it is. God has given us intelligence so that we may test everything with our own reason and not rely upon hearsays. The diamond will not become thistle; the truth will not become false head, even if a million people believe that they will. So far as I am concerned servitude at the Threshold of Abdul Baha is my greatest crown. No one can rob me of this {{p4}} nor any can take it away from me. Let others gain fame. I love to lose mine in his path. Let others accumulate gold, but let me share in the riches of his Kingdom. In this Holy Cause we must become pure, evanescent, humble and lowly. The least trace of envy, jealousy or ill-feeling shall cast us out of the Kingdom. If we are commanded to love the whole world, how much more must we be loving, to our own spiritual brothers and sisters? O God, O God! I must ever pray, a new heart give unto me! A new consciousness grant me! A new spirit confer upon me! I am weak make me strong! I am poverty-striker, make me rich, through Thy heavenly Treasury! If I have Thy good pleasure, the criticism of the whole world will not sadden me; but if I am ashamed to stand in Thy Presence, the praises and commendations of all the people will not me firmness and resolution!

I have just received a copy of "La Revuo"; Esperants magazine of May containing not only the translation of the Esperanto Address in Paris but a very interesting article on the Bahai Movement. One every two month, this Magazine will publish a most valuable Tablet of Baha-ullah, or an address of Abdul Baha, always in Esperante. "La Revuo" is the only Magazine that carries Dr. Zamenhoff's articles.

I always liked to write something about one of our most devoted Bahais in Paris. This person happens to be Miss Chevalier, a French believer. She is very charming, very sincere, very quiet. I have heard her read the French hidden words in the meetings and immediately I liked her, because {{p6}} she reads with so much earnestness and sweetness. Cowardly she looks very much like one of Davis' girls in Chicago. Those who have had the good fortune of meeting them Know how devoted they are in the Cause and how happy were they the last time the Beloved attended a Feast in their home. They were like surcharged batteries of divine joy! I shall never forget that heavenly night in Chicago! What holy and spiritual experiences have been our shares in this glorious Cause! May God grant us a celestial vision to cherish these important events in their true bearing's. This morning Miss Chevalier came to see the Master. He told her: What I admire in you is your firmness in the Cause! Although you have had many things to discourage you, yet through them all you have weathered the worst storms. I love people, who are firm in any case, whether national or spiritual. Bravo! Bravo! that you have stood like a soldier in your past! There are some people who are like weather cocks! They turn their faces <7> toward any direction the winds happen to blow! Those who are active and will ever remain active in the Cause, shall win the crown of the Everlasting Glory! Let nothing discourage you! Be fearless! Turn all thy attention toward the Kingdom of Abha! Speak about the Cause. Raise thy voice in meetings and assemblages! Try this and thou shalt stand amazed at the results! Thou shalt observe how the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha are encircling thee! Never mind if thou hast not spoken before! Open thy tongue in the praises and glorifications of Thy Lord! I shall pray for thee that thou mayst become a heavenly daughter, a radiant angel, a herald of the Kingdom and a gleaming star in the horizon of Abha!

To another French Bahai he said: The world of matter is full of vices and the people of these regions are engaged too much in chasing material things. Thy are thinking too much of money and the tinsels and play things they can buy with it. The precious hours of the day and the night are devoted to thinking and speaking in terms of France; what should they eat today; how can thy buy that especial dress tomorrow; when can they go to the ballroom and have a dizzy whirl around; what time can they attend the latest sensation in the theatrical world! If these people are so captivated in the claws of senses, they are less than the animals. God has distinguished man through his spiritual and intellectual powers. He has conferred upon him the invisible forces of conception and ideation - so that he may become celestial, just, intelligent, and attracted to the Kingdom of God! You must make these people understand {{p9}} these ideal principles so that they became aware and mindful! Tell them: you have tried the material world and intriguing its seductive pleasures; now come, and travel with us for a while through the spiritual world. If the experiences are pleasing, continue to travel with us; if they are not you can return easily to your ways. Let us together fly toward the realm of light; if the lights are too strong for you, you may come back to your black cell. How do you like this of teaching plan? Is that a good bargain? This way speaking you to the materialists. But address the religionists as follow: O ye people! How long, how long are ye submerged in deep slumber! O ye brothers! How long, how long are ye satisfied with traditions and dogmas! The Sun of Rightheousness has arisen 

{{p10}}

Awake ye! The morn of Eternity has appeared! shake off from your bodies this spiritual lethargy. The portals of the celestial Kingdom are open, enter ye therein! The divine Treasury is rediscovered, enrich yourselves! The Merciful Graces are all encircling, avail the opportunity! Awake! Awake! This is the day of wakefulness and not sleep! This is the century of deeds and not words! This is the age of production and not sterility. This is the period of conflagration and not extinction! This is the time of contagious enthusiasm and not luke warmness. Gird ye up the lions of endeavor, band ye together! Be ye loving towards each other! Banish, banish the nightmare of differences and ill-feeling. Your maker has created, you for love's sake! Arise, arise, for the glorious Luminary has arisen and has healing in its royal wings! Be ye as balls of fire! Be ye as torches of guidance! Increase your love daily! Add to your affection hourly! Ye are the children of God and the has endowed you with the possibilities of infinite progress.

In the afternoon Gaemmagam and Entezamas - Saltanah came to see our Beloved. After drinking tea and enjoying a most beautiful talk from his heavenly tongue, he invited them to a drive through the Bois de Balogne. At first I thought I will be deprived of the dear privilege of accompanying them but then the Master sent Enteza-Mas Salteneh wonderful, wonderful drive! I had never enjoyed anything exactly like this. It takes my breath away whenever I think I am sitting face to face with the Light of the world! The park was luxuriantly green, the flowers were entrancingly beautiful, the lakes were dotted with pleasure-boats and their fairy-like occupants, the tall trees were dreamily verdant. The automobile drove through the most delightful tunnels of trees. I was fairly floating {{p12}} on the shimmering sea of Happiness. From the depth of my heart I wished all the Believers were with us there and then and hear the Beloved talk on Baha-ullah. He told us three stories; one about his early childhood; another about Baha-ullah and the third a romantic, most artistic and postural story about the charming custom of the lover and loved one in Mazanderan. I wish I had time to incorporate these three-original stories in this letter but like many other things I relegate them to the future. I hope I will have time to write a little book especially on the stories as told by Abdul Baha! Wouldn't that be interesting! I have already more than a hundred stories tucked up in my note books! Stories which I would have gladly shared them with you had I have more time to write them out. But I think at this time his life-giving utterances on spiritual subjects are of more benefit than the stories. What do you think? {{p13}} On our return we took a walk through Rue Lauriston, Avenue Bois de Balogue, back to Eloile and then through avenue Kleber to the hotel.

Tonight Mon. and Madame Richard came and from 8 to 11 o'clock a most wonderful discussion flowed back and forth on the proofs of the existence of God, on divine philosophy, on Sufism, on pantheism. I have the notes of this significant conversation in my share it with me. The Master recited other logical and irrefutable evidences about the existence of divinity which were not in the talk that I sent you sometimes ago.

Although God has perfected {{p14}} his bounties for us. We have nothing to murmur against! His spiritual and material generosity have enveloped us. Now in order to be faithful to him and to his noble - exalted Teachings, let us all do our best and promote as for and as wildly as possible.

America! Always America! America is getting the lion's share of spiritual Knowledge and divine wisdom! The Persian Bahais who have done so much, who have sacrificed everything for the sake of the Cause seldom get in these days any Tablets. Stacks of letters arrive from the Oriental countries and are left unanswered; but since our departure from America is more than one hundred and fifty Tablets have been revealed, translated and mailed to the United States. Is not this a most manifest sign of Abdul Baha's divine Love for the inhabitants of those regions? {{p2}} There are Bahais in Persia who will gladly give up everything if they could receive just one lines from the Master and this is not an exaggeration! The America Bahais must truly appreciate the inestimable value of these heavenly gifts! Every Tablet is a fountain of divine Knowledge and a rose-garden in which the hyacinths and anemones of Love Grow and spread their Fragrances, a celestial Table on which is prepared all Kinds of delicious; and a most priceless heritage to posterity. Let those who are fortunate to get Our Beloved's Tablets protect and take good care of them, as the apples of their eyes. The descendants of the present Bahais will feel proud because in their houses will be found the Tablets of Abdul Baha.

{{p3}}   

This morning after the revelation of many Tablets for America the Master rested and later received the friends in his room. Mrs. Lilianthal and Mrs. Beede. He told them about the wonderful spirituality of the Bahai meetings in Persia, how the believers love each other, how they are devoted to the Cause, and how they cooperate and assist each other. He expressed the hope that such divine and illumined gatherings may be established all over America, that the friends in those parts may show to all the people of the world that they are the embodiments of unity and the personifications of disinterested love. {{p4}} To another person he said: God has created man so that he may advance along all the degrees of progress. If such a state exists! He will become successful, he will obtain eternal joy; he will not be withered and unhappy. He will be always young and fresh.

To a mother he said: How are your children? Are they well? Do you give them an ideal education? The children of today are the citizens of tomorrow. The mothers of today inculcate so many material ideas in the minds of their children in the way of encouragement;Study hard and shall become the general of an army. They do not incite them in the acquirement of the ideal virtues. They do not tell them: 'Strive that you may become a sincere, just now; that you may serve faithfully the world of humanity.' It is in the power of a mother to educate {{p5}} her child in such wise that he may be the leader amongst the leaders or let him grew amidst such depressing environments as to become the worst criminal! Now you (addressing all the room) are all my own children. I desire ro educate you in such wise as to become illumined, divine and godlike; day unto day you may advance; your conduct and character may improve, your spiritual perception may increase and your minds become more radiant. May each one of you become as an ignited lamps, shedding the rays of wisdom to all the dark corners and crevices! {{p6}} Consider the condition of the people! From morning til evening, they run hither and thither, working and laboring, sweating and striving! All their thoughts are weighed by the measures of Frames. The man who has one hundred Frames does his utmost to make it a thousand; the person who has one thousands works like a bearer to make it ten thousand. The ten thousand man has his eyes fixed on a million; and the millionaire with the greatest avidity longs to become a mutli-millionaire. All of them are submerge in this sea of insatiable hunger for gold. Let me get all I can out of the other fellow" is the universal dictum. What is the end of it all? At last he leaves behind his accumulated wealth and goes away empty handed. But if such a man was imbued with spiritual characteristics he would have become the light of the world and the guide of the nations. All that you see is subject to change. Where is the {{p7}} living, fire-breathing, past generation? Where is Napoleon, the Great with his Austerity victory and Moscow Retreat? Where are the unconquerable phalanxes of his Imperial guards? Where are the long lines of the French Kings? Where are the many Louises? Where are the children of Orleans? Where are the descendants of Philippines? All, all gone! They have walked through the wilderness of oblivion and the valley of the shadow of death.

Speaking about the future of the Cause in Paris he said: The present indifference shall be replaced by a great enthusiasm; the call of Abha shall be raised from every house and the Banner of "Ya Baha El Abha" shall become unformed from the top of every home. Rest {{p8}} ye assured of this.

To a number of French Bahais he said: Day and night strive and teach. Do ye not rest for one moment? Organize meetings. Deliver speeches in the gatherings. Speak with eloquence and fluency of tongue. Proclaim: O ye French people! How long are ye sleep upon the couch of ease! How long do you prefer unbelievers of the beliefs! How long are ye in advertent! The divine Shepherd has come to you. To not run in the joins of the wolves. The real shepherd loves you and desires to gather you in one flock. Do not fly away from him. The celestial Orb is shining. The Sun of Reality is in the meridian. The rain of Bestowal is pouring down! Are ye yet sleep? Consider what an eternal Sovereignty was founded by those came beneath the shadow of the True One! How many Queens have come into this world and after a few years their names and fame entirely forgotten. But the Queenship of Mary Magdelaine {{p9}} is yet eternal in the Kingdom of Christ.

Today he was invited to lunch in the house of Mon and Madame Dreyfus. At one o'clock he came with his automobile and took him there. At five returned and took me with himself for a long walk through the avenue Kleber, avenue Victor Hugo etc. Returning home he felt quite tired. He ate very little, - a glass of milk and retired to his room. Thus another divine day lapsed into the past, never to return again but ever living in the memory, even after death.

We are receiving interesting about the New York Convention. Miss Hart who attended all the sessions was in the meeting tonight at Mon. Dreyfus and spoke on her impressions of the Feasts the meetings etc. She expressed the greatest pleasure at knowing Mrs Kring, Mrs Kinny. Miss Thompson, yourself and many other Newyork Bahais. She praised the spirit of unanimity and enthusiasm. We were that most happy to hear from one who has been actually present. {{p2}} We have not yet received the official report of the Convention, but hope to receive it soon. I have also received quite a number of newspaper clippings on the subject and some of them I read to the Master.

This morning the Beloved received the callers privately. It is evident that an individual receives more spiritual uplift and inspiration by meeting him alone the presence of any other person. In this manner they open to him their hearts ask any question they have in mind and carry back with themselves an irrevocable impression of beauty, spirituality and holiness. One of those who called on him was Miss B. Erwin. She asked many questions about the ninety names of Gods I of which are mentioned in the Koran; about {{p3}} the detached letters in the beginnings of several chapters in the Koran; about the :four holy months" in the Mohamadan calendar and about the ideal significances of the various organs of the body etc. The Master patiently and sweetly gone full answers to their interesting questions. Miss Erwin is a girl of unusual talent. She has studied the Oriental religious literature, especially its mystic and philosophic aspect. She recites well and writes fine poems. She is now a devoted Bahai. She asked what practical work she can do for the movement. He said: Spread the Glad tidings. Teach the Cause. Dedicate as much of thy time as that cause to the promotion {{p4}} of the word of God. I will pray for thee that like into a torch thou mayst burn with the Fire of the Love of God. Teach the Cause. This is the most practical and most important work of the day. In the afternoon Miss Hogdson dropped in and told the Master of an interesting letter written in the Christian Commonwealth by a woman. Sh has one son and writes that she has one son and one daughter. As she is not wealthy she has wrough money to put his son through the university but having read the teaching of Abdul Baha that the education of the girls is of more importance, she is in adilemma and does not know what to do? The Master laughed heartily over the situation and told Miss Hadgson to write to this lady: Educate thy daughter because later on she will become a mother and will be able {{p5}} to train well your grand children. If you educate her, it means you have educated many. The mothers are the real educators of the human race. The importance of this great fact is not yet fully known. It is the sun of all the questions of this age. Then Mon. Dreyfus come and took him to call on Ronha Khanom. He returned about seven o'clock.

A propos of something he said: Whosoever schemes in this Cause will come to no good end. Above all other things are must be honest to over consciences and not dissimulate. {{p6}} We must not speak against each other either publicly or privately. We must not belittle the services rendered by others because they are not so fortunately situated as ourselves. We must be humble. We must not have the spirit of destructive criticism. Be fore making any statement we must investigate it first thoroughly, whether it is true or not. We must not make the hearts of other sad. We must speak with gentleness and brotherliness. We must not backbite. We must speak about each other with consideration and infinite courtesy. We must adorn our temples with extreme politeness. We must not be rude to any human being. We must judge the people by their in word, spiritual qualities. Let no one raise his tongue in intuitional or unintentional malice against his brother or sister. We must watch our tongues. This Cause is great {{p7}} and the circle of our patience must be very wide. Let every man write this sentence 'Watch thy tongue on the tablet of his heart. Let me relate to you a story which shows you more than anything else that we must ever look beyond the toward appearance and form and judge a person by his spiritual worth. After the appearance of the Bab the disciple who succeeded him was called "Baha-el Bab". The believes of God at that time gave him the greatest homage and respect. When Baha-el Bab was in the fortress of Tabarassi surrounded by thousands of enemies, Khuddus another great teacher was in the company of the 360 Babis who were be seized in this fortress. No one gave any {{p8}} importance to Khuddus, He was one amongst the brothers. No one looked upon him with any deference. He mingled with all the friends and always when Bab-el Bab was sitting he was standing reverently before him. However one day there was observed a great change. The friends found Khuddus setting and Bab-El Bab standing before him far away near the door. Ofcourse every one was astonished. Then Bab-El Bab addressing the believers said in hushed voices. I did not know before the station of Khuddus. Tonight I realize that I am less than the dust under his feet. "From that time on he served Khuddus like a servant and later on Khuddu         receiving a fracture of tooth through the passing of a rifle bartridge, Bab-El  Bab came to him and begged him to let him go out of the fortress and sacrifice his life in his path and he did so.

Dear Harriet!

When Miss Hart gave an interesting account of the meeting and sessions of the Convention he was very pleased and then he said: - "Praise is to God that in many American cities the Divine summon is raised and the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abba are heard. In the future it will become illumined!" She mentioned the names of the many united Bahais  and their messages of love and devotion. {{p2}} While Miss Hart was present, Mrs  Noel came in. She was welcomed by the Master. She had heard about the cause but had never seen him. As soon as she entered her face and carriage impressed me as a woman of intellectual power and ability. She said to the Master that she has a  clear comprehension of religion as  an intellectual fact but not as a spiritual reality. She has come this morning to his Half Presence and is seeking the illumination of the heart. The more your faith grow in Baha-allah, the greater will be the illumination of your heart because the spirit of man is strengthened and reinforced through the utterances and the love of Baha-allah. Just as the body receives force through food, so the spirit is in need of the spiritual food. What is the food of the spirit? It is the love of God and the Knowledge of God, the praiseworthy. Endeavor that you may adorn thyself with these heavenly virtues, be attracted to the Kingdom of Abba and arise with the greatest joy to serve  your fellowmen, as long as your aim is pure joy shall became confirmed. If our object is unselfish, we must feel assures that the highest desire of our heart shall be obtained. I will pray for you......My prayers are something universal and sometimes special. I will specially pray for you. She was made very happy and wept with joy. She said "after I have glimpses of truth but at other times I am left in darkness." The Master said :-" you must strive to enter into the spiritual state and be established  in the Kingdom. Once these, you are eternally submerged in a sea of light. There will be no unhappiness and no {{p3}} sadness. She asked about renunciation. Do we attain to the state of renunciation after we have realized God and his powers or we must renounce our desires before our attainment to this spiritual condition? “The Master said: - "First we must make ourselves receptive, then the bounties of God descend upon us. The mirror must because clear from rust first then the sun with all its glory will be reflected therein. Prepare your apartment first before you invite the guests. Therefore, first we must because severed and detached then we will obtain the divine Bounties. Renunciation or severance does not mean to suppress you and sensuous much feelings to shun the activities of life and to shift the responsibilities that God has laid upon our shoulders. It means to overcome the dark powers of nature, to be frees from the promptings of self, to become a governor over one's ego and the passions, to let the susceptibilities of the spirit rule over the body. This is the meaning of renunciation. In short, man must become a radiant being and a heavenly spirit.

{{p4}}

Several other people came and then he spoke to them privately. They came out of his room with joyful faces.
In the afternoon three very important Persians called on the Master Fayyad Assadullah prepared tea and till 5'oclock he was speaking with them on Persia, Turkey etc.
He sent us to Mr Scoths meeting and he went out to walk alone.

{{p5}}

On our return from the meeting, he called on Miss Sanderson to inquire about her Mother's health. In the cause of conversation he praised very much the Persians. She speaks quite clearly. "Shape, "he said you will study the Persian language to the extent of writing letters and comparing poems. There I will send you to Persian. This will be most wonderful you have the power of composition and style. Memorize the poems of Baba Allah. All the old Bahais know that I have never studied Arabic. I have not taken one lesson in Arabic. No one may believe this but there are still some believers living who hear testimony to this fact. Yet my arabic, both written and spoken is the masterpiece all over the East. I will tell how I became to know Arabic. when I was very, very young, I found in our house in Teheran a large voluminous book containing many in Arabic prayers revealed by the Baba and copied by Baba -allah. I had such a longing that I used to read  the contents of this book all the time. Often I would get up in the middle of night, light the candle and then read and read this book without understanding its meaning. The effect of those prayer was so great that I would weep over them. all of a sudden I observed that I could understand the significance of the book without being laugh by any soul.
He returned to the hotel and I look the sheet and went to the East station to welcome {{p6}} Miss Fanny Knoblock who has travelled from Shettfort to meet the Master. The train arrived at 9.20 and by previous arrangement I took her to the International hotel who Miss Lilianthat and Mrs Beede are living. They were waiting in the reception room to greet her. She will come to see the Master tomorrow and may stay in Paris till Saturday then she will return to Sheetfort  to be with her sister for two weeks and after that back to America. I hope she will go by way of New York so that you may hear her speak shout her experiences in Germany and France. when I returned to the hotel the Master was up and speaking with the Persians. He had made them laugh all night. they were all in food humor.

Dear Harriet!
	
The other day the Beloved received a lovely letter from Mr. and Mrs. Stark of Budapest in answer to his wonderful Tablet! He has revealed for them another Tablet but herein I like to quote a portion of their letter which to me is an indication to their faith and assurance. It is as follow:-"The revelation you were so exceedingly kind to communicate to us contains the most welcome blessing for our souls, which are craving after Love and Spirituality and is giving also a powerful encouragement to us to offer our humble personalities as channels for the Love of God. We pray you to accept our deepest thanks for these heavenly bestowals. It is not ours to thank you for your coming to our city. Now we, but hidden powers incomparably greater than ours brought about this historic event, But we may be allowed to rejoice that we have been found worthy to be chosen as a mouth piece for the call of a striving group of souls. The consciousness of our vocation shall give eloquence to our speech and fluency to our pen. We pray ardently for the aid of Baha El Abha!"

Is not this a simple direct beautiful letter flowing from the heart? How great is to live in this day and receive the Knowledge of God direct from its pure source! The privilege is so wonderful, the blessing is so divine, the thought is so sublime that we can hardly realize it! Like unto the fish we are swimming in the sea of spiritual Favors! Wherever we look we behold the signs of His Love and Benevolence! We are soaring in the etherial regions of light!

{{p2}}

When we were in Germany I received letters from Mrs. Maude M. Holbach from England. The New York friends know her well. The Master wrote there to come to Paris if possible and this morning to our delight and pleasure she arrived. Her aim is to come next winter to Haifa with her husband, stay there several months, received daily lessons from the Master, study Bahai life and teachings and then write a story for the Western public. Of course all these depends upon the Master's presence in Haifa. She had a long and interesting interview with him, devoted mainly to an exposition of the meaning of the resurrection of Christ. She was very glad to see him again and will be a daily visitor for the next four or five days, after which she will return again to England. She is a wonderfully intelligent keen woman and a Bahai story from her pen will be of deep interest to all the students of the movement.

{{p3}}

Next Miss Fanny Knoblock was presented to the Master. He asked about the German Bahais and their meetings, He said: Thy sister has served the Cause very much. That is why I wrote her to travel throughout all the cities of Germany and summon the people to the Kingdom of Abha! She must feel assured that Baha-Ullah will assist her. You are her partner in the promotion of the Cause. You must praise God because you are such three heavenly sisters, each one serving the Cause day and night!

{{p4}}

She asked a question about the Bahai Sunday school. He said: This is very important. The Sunday school for the children must be continued. Thus will they be informed with the history of Cause, the Bahai teachings and principles. Their morality will then become Bahai morality. Let the circle of the Sunday school for the children be constantly enlarge and not contracted. She asked several other questions to all of which the Beloved gave definite answers.

{{p5}}

A few others received the benign blessing of his Presence and then he come out and gave a talk divided into two parts. The first part I will translate in this letter; the second part I will leave for the future; being mainly about the heedlessness of the Jews in the day of Christ and their subsequent degradation. He said: In his own days they placed a crown of thorns upon Christ head, but today they put a crown of gold upon the head of his statue and painting. It would have been a hundred thousand times better if they payed him these homages when alive.

{{p6}}

They diverted to another subject saying are like unto the children. The most unimportant event gives them happiness and the most trifling incident saddens their hearts. For example, if you give one franc to a child, it will make him very happy, but if he loses it he is sorrow-stricken. If you carry a doll to a little girl she flies to the heaven of joy and if the doll is stolen by her playmates she is cast to the depth of despair. In short, an infinitesimal incident gives happiness to some; and the most inconsequential event makes other sad. In the morning, they are boiling over with the exuberance of joyousness and in the evening they have simmered down to the point of despondency and sheer disappointment. This is a sign of the weakness of their character and the feebleness of their faith. But a wisely-directed soul, a person whose heart is illumined with the Light of God, who is imbued with the quality of radiant acquiescence, and who is informed with the open mysteries of the divine world- is always in the same condition and is never upset by the constantly changing events of life. His heart is attached to the Spring of All; his happiness is eternal, because it comes from God; his rejoicing is perpetual, because it is based upon the eternal rock of the Knowledge of God, his beatitude is never-failing because it is emanated from the virtues of the world of humanity. This joy undergoes no change and transformation. This happiness is age-abiding! If a person is thirsty for the water of the Knowledge of God, his happiness is unfailing. If a soul is interested in humanitarian deeds, his joy is perennial. Therefore, the happiness that comes through God is a light that is not followed by any darkness; a healing which is not ended by any disease; a glory which is not consummated by any shame. Consequently, we must search diligently after the everlasting and not temporary happiness.

{{p7}}

For a few seconds the Master got silent and then looking toward the window he said to Miss Sanderson:- The sky in Paris is often cloudy. A Persian poet was present and immediately answered: "One sky cannot have two suns!" Wasn't that a most appropriate remark!

{{p8}}

Afterwards he called Entezamos-Saltaneh to himself and together they went out to take a walk. On their return he brought in a basket of apricots which he divided amongst all of us. He gave four to each. Sayad Assadullah had prepared for him dish of pillow and he kept Entezomos-Saltaneh to eat with him and urged him to eat as much rice as possible.

In the afternoon he went to Bais de Bologue with Doctor Mohamad Khan and as he walked along he sang most of the time Bahai poems and chanting the prayers of Baha-Ullah. Then he called on Mon. and Madame Dreyfus. They served him tea. It was about 8 o'clock when he came to the hotel. After an hour of rest he took a bath and retired to his room.

I am glad to report that I have seldom seen the Master feeling so well as these days. He enjoys perfect health and he is happy. He makes us all feel rejoiced when we see him well.

I have written so much for the last few months that I am afraid I am getting the writer's crump. After writing a few pages, I feel a burning pain in my arm and fingers; but I am sure this is only temporary. It will pass away. I must use my pen for a long time yet I have not commenced writing. I have been doing some scribblings. My heart is dancing with joy, because I am trying to serve the Beloved and the believers. You pray for me that God may make me a sincere servant of Abdul Baha.

Dear Harriet!

Now that thou returnest to America carry for the friends of God the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abha! Confer upon them rejoicing! Exhilarate them with the wine of happiness. Stir them with the Breeze of joyousness! Move them with the cry of ya Baha El Abha! This wonderful message was given to Miss Fanny Knoblock in the course of Conversation with the Beloved this morning!

His desire is to see America aflame with the Fire of the Love of God, to hear the news that the friends are striving day and night to establish the Kingdom of God upon the earth, to upraise the standard of good fellowship amongst all the nations of the world and that they are associating with all the people with joy and Fragrance. The greater the unity of the friends, the happier the heart of Abdul Baha. The believers of God must not only practice unity but they must sacrifice their lives for each other if necessary. The Cause of Baha-Ullah is the Cause of life and love; the religion of the Blessed Perfection is the religion of peace and reality. The Bahais must walk in the footsteps of the standard bearer of this Truth. They must hear no evil, see no evil and talk no evil. The Bahais are the positive forces of life. They must generate only life-giving qualities. There are many pessimists and prophets of evils nowadays. The friends of God are the real optimists and bringers of glad news to all humanity. No difference exists amongst them. They are a united band, eager to serve.

{{p2}}

This morning we had a call from a Persian poet who talked a good deal about the ingratitude of the Persian people who do not become Bahais, because this Cause was the only solution for all their difficulties. Abdul Baha was rendering a greater service to Persia than all the combined efforts of the Persians themselves that He was bringing the East and the West nearer to each other that he was creating love between the Persians and Americans a thing undreamed of by others. Who could do this? Whoever was able to perform such a miracle? If someone asked him through what means Persia could be saved? He would answer, through the Bahai religion that the Bahai religion was the only salvation for Persia and no intelligent person could deny this.

{{p3}}

Then he spoke about the Editor of a Persian Journal in Egypt who has written and published a book against the Bahai cause. When this book was brought to the attention of the Master he sent him the following wonderful message:- If I know that thou wouldst not think that I am afraid I would have sent thee a gift for writing such a book against the Bahai Movement. Thy example is like unto the ant who scaled a high, sturdy poplar tree and once reaching the top, it tried to shake the tree and uproot it. The poplar tree laughed at the ant and said:- Don't thou not know that I have experienced many storms, gales, hurricanes and wild tempestuous nights! And now thou little and hast come to shake and uproot me! Vain is thy thought! And the poplar tree laughed again.

{{p4}}

A story was related of a Bahai who was questioned by a great enemy of this Movement: why did you accept this Cause? He answered: Because of your opposition!

Mrs. Monde Holbach had an interview with the Beloved discussing further the plan of her journey to Haifa in the month of October. She is very enthusiastic about this work.

{{p5}}

A Bahai hearing the Master speak, took off her hot, stepped humbly before him and asked: What can I do that I may not see the faults of others? He said: Thou must look for thy self and within thy self and find thine own errors and weaknesses. If thou host any imperfection thy self, try to improve it. Busy thy self with thine own improvement. Man is a blind far-seeing creature. He is blind to his own faults but he far sees the faults of others, thousands of miles away. Think always how to become more spiritual, to receive a larger portion from the Bounties of Baha-Ullah, to be submerged in the sea of his Mercy. Thank ye God that ye are living in the age of Baha-Ullah and you have recognized Him in his own day. Your station is very high. You have won the Crown of the Everlasting Glory! For lunch he was invited to Mon. Dreyfus. 

{{p6}}

After lunch and rest he called on Rouha Khanom. From there he went to Pathe' Fieres where his voice is being taken in phonograph and there will be four records. On his return to the hotel he was some what tired and ordered his food to be brought up to his room. He was very happy and while eating he spoke to us about the Cause.

Dear Harriet!

In a few days Mirza Jalal will be back and then we shall know when the Beloved decides on his return to Egypt. Egypt during the summer is very hot but I am told. Ramlah, a resort in the vicinity of Alexandria is cooler and from the present indications the Master may not go to Haifa before the coming winter. However his Presence in Paris is a spiritual blessing to all Europe, because even if we do not have public meetings he irradiates from his central being light and joy from the centre of his being. Those who are spiritually-minded feel the quick vibrations of his individuality. His divine spirit of beauty quickens the souls and enraptures the hearts.

{{p2}}

This morning after drinking tea and enjoying quietly the presence of the Beauty of the Covenant, he called me to himself and following him he called on S.S. -This gentleman has rented the same apartment that the Master had it on his first visit to Paris about two years ago. He is one of the most prominent men of Persia and while in London he was entertained by many English Lords. In each one of those meetings, they had asked him whether he knows Abdul Baha. He said to the Master: "I was most pleased and very proud to know that there was at least one Persian who has come to the West and was the cause of the glory of Persia and had such lofty thoughts and exalted ideas as to stir the Western world."

{{p3}}

He asked about the progress of the Cause in America. The Beloved spoke in detail and summed up as follows:- There was a very large number of people who only love this Cause and are in sympathy with its principles and like to see them spread. There was another class of people who think Baha-Ullah to be a very great personage and they classify him along with other spiritual thinkers of this age. They even go to the point of saying. His teachings are good for the Orient and may assist to solve some of our problems in the Occident. There was a third class, however, who believe that Baha-Ullah was the Manifestation of the will of God, the Promised One of all nations and who try to spread his Teachings by deeds and by words. This third class are called Bahais.

{{p4}}

The question of "Light" was discussed. What was the meaning of light mentioned in the holy books? Was it this physical light? The Master said:- There are three kinds of lights. The light of the sun has only one function and that is to make things manifest. This light is not important. It is only the result of ethereal vibrations. The second light is the light of the Eye which has two functions. It is the manifestor of phenomena and the seer of phenomena. The third light is the light of intellect. This has three functions. It is the Manifestor, the seer and the comprendor of phenomena. The light which is mentioned in the holy books is therefore the light of the intellect.

{{p5}}

Master gave for the interest of those who were present, a review of the history of the Cause, its successive tribulations and vicissitudes. The question of divinity was touched and many similar interesting subjects. S.S. was greatly impressed and it was long after eleven o'clock when we left the apartment and came to the hotel. There were several Bahais waiting patiently. The Master received them one by one, and talked with each on his individual problems. He did not go out today but rested. At 3 o'clock several Persians came and then he spoke with them till four. Mon. Dreyfus came and took him to call on Madame Jackson who has just returned from Nice. On his return, the Correspondent of the Christian Commonwealth was waiting. He praised the Editor of that weekly and sent him his loving messages. He talked about the Cause in the various cities he has recently visited and gave glowing tribute to the German people. This man will come to our meeting tomorrow night to report it for the C.C.N.s. one of the princes of Persia who has been away and just returned called and the Master spoke with him a long time about the recent troubles in Persia against Bahais.

It was altogether a busy day and the Master enjoyed to meet these various people. How he spoke with each according to his capacity and understanding! He has the key to every heart and without any effort on his part, all the hearts are opened before him! He is alone the reader of our inmost thoughts and ideas.


### Mayth 23rd 1913 BALTIMORE HOTEL 88 BIS, AVENUE KLEBER

{{p1}}

To the Bahai world this is doubly sacred. It is the Birthday of Abdul Baha and the Declaration of the Bab. The Bahais everywhere are spreading the Banquet of happiness and here in Paris we are in the Presence of the One in whose name and Teaching Countenance is our daily Feast. Much light is thrown upon the divine character of Abdul Baha when we consider that he exhorts us to celebrate this Feast, because, it is the day of the Declaration of the Bab and not because it is his birthday  Anniversary: Of course, two such important events transpired {{p2}} on the same day; therefore it is a blessed day. It is of wide significance and interest even to an outsider to think that two spiritual leaders of the past and present century have been by Providence born to commence and finish a work for told by all the prophets and fulfilled by Baha-ollah. Through the untiring zeal of the Bab, the coming of the Kingdom was heralded throughout the length and breadth of Persia. He was the morning-star of this glorious Revelation which led all mankind to the heavenly Goal. He prepared the way for the appearance of the Lord and fortold the appearance of the Lord and for told the approaching rise of the sun of Reality. He exhilarated all the hearts with the wine of longing and declared the establishment of the Kingdom of the Father upon earth. Now our Beloved is calling upon men to enter into the Kingdom of Abha, the Doors of which are open before all the faces. 

{{p3}}

Our earliest callers this morning were Mrs. M. Holback and Miss Fanny Knoblock. They had come with lovely bouquets of flowers and basket of fruits to greet the Master on his birthday. It was about 7 o'clock. The Beloved greeted them and they too took their seats. Then Conversation started naturally about the Bab. Later on Mrs. Lilianthal and Mrs. Beede and many others came, all bringing roses, carnations, pots of blooms etc. By twelve o'clock to the reception room was a rose-garden and several baskets of fruits and candies were on the table. The faces of the believers were radiant with joy and each expressed his or her happiness {{p4}} to be on such a day in the company of the Master. Although the American friends were not here, yet on this day of all days, he found time to reveal many Tablets for them. The calm and quiet hours in his room- with no one but me - while he walks majestically to and for dictating Tablets-are such heavenly experiences which will never be effaced from the page of my memory. How fortunate are those souls whose names are mentioned by Our Beloved on a day like unto this! A message of Peace and greeting was brought to him from America indirectly through New York Herald. It was part of the speech of Mr. Bryan Secretary of State, given before the Army and Navy Club on May 14th in which he gives his conception of the battle ship of the future. The Beloved was most pleased not only the thought but the consistent earnestness and splendid enthusiasm and optimism of Mr. Bryan. I will quote it herein, because the Master praised {{p5}} it and all the friends loved it. It is so much in line with the Bahai principles of Peace and justice. Therefore the Dreadnoughts of the future according to Mr. Bryan's conception is as follow: "Its compass is the heart; its shells carry good will; its missiries are projected by the smokeless powder of love; its Captain is the Prince of Peace. I want you to drink with me to the battleship, Friendship. No target will withstand the projectiles which Friendship sends abroad." 

For the last three or four days I have not been feeling well at all; so when this morning I entered the Presence of the Beloved he inquired about my health. I said: it seems to me that as long as we are enjoying good health, we do not appreciate it enough; what a divine {{p6}} blessing is health! He said: "We know things by their opposites. Knowledge is more appreciated when we observe the stultifying influence of ignorance. Sight and hearing is more thought of when we see the conditions of thr blind and the deaf. A person living on the border of a flowing river all his life does not know what thirst is. When we were travelling from w thought we go ahead of the family, pitch the tent and prepare everything till Baha-ollah and the rest of the party arrive. There were twenty three of us, all on horses. When we got away several miles from the main body, the sun rose high in the heavens and it shone dozzlingly upon our heads. We became aware that in our hurry to get away quickly we has forgotten to bring with us the water-bags. We looked around and there was nothing visible but a wilderness of hot sand and getting hotter every hour. We asked our guide whether there was any spring in the vicinity and he said: no. We could not have any water before we reached the next station, sixteen miles away! What could we do now? Our lips were parched with thirst; some of us almost to the point of fainting. I urged the company onward, my friends, Spur your houses!. We galloped several miles and we were nearly succombed to the awful heat when in the far off horizon, we observed several block tents of the nomads. Those black tents to my eyes were at the time greater than the palaces of the Kings. We hastened toward the tents and reached them literally half-dead. There was no human being visible, so I called out aloud; water! water! water! An old woman came out of one of tents and shook her head, meaning that she has no water. Them I asked her: 'Have you 'Doing'? 9sour milk diluted {{p8}} with water). She answered in the affirmation. She took us then to a tripod made of wood over which was hanging a black skin, sack filled with "Doug". She opened its aperture and each one of us drunk one cup. It was as cold as ice. In this part of the world, there is a wind, blowing at this season as hot as fire. It scorches one's face and lips and peals the skin; it makes the earth dry but when it blow over a jar of water or a skin-bag of Doug, it makes it as cold as ice. This wind other times is called sometimes 'Sam' and 'Sharghi'. In short, we drunk three skinfold of "Doug" and then we laid stretched down our bodies, some under the shade of the tents, others right beneath the sun. We could not enter then tents, because, these nomads live with their castles. When we awake we felt as new being and continued our journey. Experience teaches us many lessons that we are not apt to forget."  

{{p9}}

About eleven o'clock the Master came out and greeted the friends who had gathered in the reception room. He inquired about the health of every one and they expressed thankfulness unto the Lord because they were permitted to be in the Holy Presence of the Beloved on such a blessed and significant day. He said: One day in Bagdad "Baha-ollah was walking beside the bank of Euphrates in Bagdad. A learned men of that city who had never seen Baha-ollah passed and was greatly impressed by his majestic learning and divine Face. He came to him with great reverence and humility and asked; 'Sir! Which country do you come from? 'I come from the country of Baha.' The man was puzzled. {{p10}} 'In which part of the world is it situated? he hesitatingly inquired. 'It is in the Eastern direction! What temperature? ' the man asked. 'Always moderate.' 'What kind of a country is it?' he interrogated with evident curiosity. 'It is a most marvelous country; its inhabitants are angelic; its spring for the twelve months of the year; its trees are always green, its fruits luscious; its flowers imperishable and of many hues; its roses ever spreading sweet fragrances; its meadows are perennially verdant; its sun has no setting, its stars always shining, its moon is ever full; its denizens enjoy eternal youth; its gardens are always a bloom; its sweet-singing birds ever melodious; its wine imparting everlasting exhilaration and its bounties and blessings limitless. 'Sir! he gasped with astonishment, 'I have never heard of such a country. It is not on the old maps.' 'Well!' Baha-ollah answered, 'you may find it on a new {{p11}} map which is being drawn now! 'But how can one reach there? 'The guide to that country isOne. If you follow him you shall enter the portals of that country' the Blessed perfection answered him and passed by.

When the nature of Mr. Bryan's battleships was read to him he said: "The spirit of this age demands the establishment of universal Peace. No power on earth can withstand before it. God has destined that Peace must reign in this age and it will come to pass. Let the advocates of Peace work with greater zeal and courage, for the Lord of Hosts is their Supporter.' In this radiant century and merciful age, the ears are opened, the hearts are awakened, the eyes are seeing and the consciousness are stirred. The age of strangeness has passed, the century of {{p12}} friendship has arrived. The dark hours have disappeared and the luminary of unity hath downed. Now is the time to be illumined with the the rays of the sun of the solidarity of the human race. This is not the hour to imparting life; this is the hour of self-sacrifice for the commonwealth of humanity. When I was very young, I remember one day, I was setting with a number of friends. A Kurd who was very inimical to the Persians entered the gathering and started to boast of his courage and viler. Warming with his subject, he vaunted with a great bravado that in this year he had Killed 13 Persians! Consider to what extent people are thoughtless and unaware of the ideal virtues of the world of humanity!

He spoke them on the education of the orphans: If the parents educate their own children, this is done by every one. There is no special virtues in it. But privilege and distinction lie in the direction of educating the children {{p13}} of others. When these children grow up, they are even grateful and thankful to their adopted parents.' For the existence of a new guest he was gave a lucid exposition of the Bahai principles on economics. Then he said: the real enjoyment of the world of humanity consists in the fact that every individual may think of the wellbeing of others and sacrifice his own rest for the rest of his fellowman. Then and not until then will he be really happy. I hope that all of you will attain to this station. Then you will be real Bahais. When the life-long of Mohamad was living one day his son in-law, Ali, his wife and two sous kept fast. Now, according to the Mohamadan law a person {{p14}} fasting, must not eat or drink anything from sunrise to sunset. In order to break their fasts after sunset, Ali had prepared four small loaves of bread. They had nothing else. Just before sunset poor people knocked at the door and begged for alms. Ali gave them all the loaves of bread. The four continued to fast neat day without eating anything. Four other loaves were prepared and they were again given away to a number of orphans who called about sunset time. The sun rose on the third day and they continued to fast without eating anything. They prepared for the third time four loaves of bread and just before eating a few strangers passed by the house and the loaves were given them. When Mohamad heard of the self-sacrifice of his son-in-law, his daughter and his two grandsons he sent them special food and asked them to eat themselves.

Mon, therefore must be self-sacrificing to such an extent; otherwise if he {{p15}} seeks after his own interest, he is like unto an animals. Strive that ye may assist the children of man both materially and spiritually, and be the means their guidance and illumination.

For lunch the Master went to Martha-Pension, our old hotel. At three o'clock Mon and Madame Richard came and at their request the Beloved told them three stories about Christ which are in the Gospel. Then with Mon Dreyfus, he went to the flower show. He must how made a most beautiful picture walking through lanes of flowers. {{p16}} He returned at 6 o'clock and after half an hour walked out again with Doctor Mohamad Khan to call on prominent Persians and Turkish Pashas. Tonight everybody  was invited to Mon and Madame Dreyfus, the Beloved also was there. Persian Arabs French, America, English, etc; associates with each other in the spirit of Bahai love and fellowship. The Beloved gave a wonderful talk on the life of the Bab as a preparation to the coming of Him whom God should manifest. It was a heavenly feast. He also asked Miss Erwin to read from the Hidden Words. Refreshments of various Kinds were served of Abdul Baha was happy to find himself amongst all these loving and sincere Bahais.

From April 1st to April 8th, 1913 Abdul Baha visited Germany and stayed in Stuttgart. He stopped at a hotel overlooking the plaza.

While Abdul Baha was one day looking out of his hotel window he observed a regiment of soldiers passing of in great array and he said:

"They are ready to fight for their fatherland. How barbarous it seems to send men, who do not even know each other, to the battlefield in order to shoot each other down.

"The Bahai Grand Army consist of the invisible angels of the Supreme Concourse. Our swords are the words of Light. Our armament is the armament of heaven. We are fighting against the forces of darkness.

"O my soldiers! My beloved soldier! Forward! Forward! Home no fear of defeat do not have facing hearts. Our supreme Commander is Baha-o-llah. From the height of Glory He is directly this dramatic engagement. He commands us! Rush forward! Rush forward! {{p18}} Show the strength of your arms. You shall scatter the forces of ignorance! 'Your war confers life; their war brings death. Your war is the cause of the illumination of mankind; their war means the breaking and darkness of hearts. Your war means victory upon victory; their war is defeat upon defect. Your war is the means of construction; their war is the origin of destruction.

"There are no dangers before you. Push formed! Push forward! Attack the enemy!

"Your efforts shall be crowned with the diadem of Eternal Peace and Brotherhood.

'His holiness the Christ was fighting even upon the Cross at His triumphant work continued through ages as cycles."

Dear Harriet!

We who circle around the Master are very happy because he is enjoying complete health of body. Although he has emphasized repeatedly that the spiritual health is all-important and that his spirit is free and above any human illness, yet we cannot help but to be distressed when he is not feeling well and feel correspondingly joyous when he is in the utmost of health. His Presence, under all circumstances radiates Peace and happiness. Day unto day through his divine Patience, he is adding new stones to the Temple of the Bahai Cause, gathering new laborers and masons and collecting fresh materials. Whether the whole world praises him or blames him he is the same, eternal being. He is free of all ties except the Cause of God. All traces of self and personality are lost in him. He is the embodiment of disinterestedness. He loves us for the sake of Baha-Ullah. If he gives us any Counsel, it is conducive to our own spiritual development. He is the loving father of the world of humanity. He is the glorious light that shineth in darkness illuminating the path of the wandering travelers. He is the fountain of eternal life that allays the thirst of the thirsty ones. Through him we receive the inexhaustible bounties of spirituality. His Power makes the army of the Lord invincible! His teachings encourage us to rise higher and higher toward the throne of the Almighty! His words are the imperishable flowers of the paradise of Abha!

{{p2}}

This morning after drinking tea in his holy Presence, he dictated many Tablets for the believers of London. We receive excellent reports about the progress of the Cause in that great metropolis. Of late Miss Buckton, Mrs. Fraser and General Jack have been to Edinburgh, have given a series lectures and as a result a weekly meeting is organized. The next step they are going to take is to go to Liverpool and Manchester. They are now preparing their little army so that when they reach the field of operation they will carry a vigorous campaign. England is alive to the opportunities of the Cause and therefore the friends are doing their utmost to promote the glad-tidings of the kingdom of Abha.

{{p3}}

Several friends from America found themselves in the Presence of the Beloved and they asked whether the efforts of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Bryan toward the realization of international Peace will have anything of a tangible result. He answered: Of course, these two men are sincere and honest in their aims and purposes and I pray to God that they may become successful. They are the servants of universal Peace and the oneness of the world of humanity. America has the capacity of becoming the standard bearer of international Peace. Geographically it is a vast continent far away from the jealous ayes of the envious neighbors; politically, democratic and holding aloof from the wrangling complications of Europe. Therefore America is the most ready and the most free nation to arise in the service of humanity and initiate new plans of philanthropy and encourage the establishment of eternal Peace throughout all parts of the world. I always pray that the banner of international comity and the solidarity of human race may be hoisted from America. To a number of callers he said: I am most pleased with America. I ever supplicate in behalf of America so that the Confirmations of His Holiness Baha-Ullah may encircle it. After this many friends went into his presence and received from his Silvery lips the Holy words of light. He did not speak to the assembled believers but met instead individually everyone in the Holy of Holies.

{{p4}}

For lunch he went to Martha-Pension and after his return Mon. Dreyfus and Gaemmagam were waiting for him. He talked with them for a while and then took his nap. In the afternoon he called me and we walked together to 22 Rue de Tremoille where Moneer Pasha lives. He was not home but tired with walking he stayed for half an hour in the room of the Concierge. He had two or three packages of candy and dried fruits in his pocket and gave them the little child of the Concierge. Coming out of the house we saw a mother with her child. The child was very attractive and had such blue eyes that the Master smiled and he caressed her and gave her money and candy. Then we got a carriage and had a wonderful drive through Bois de Bologne. He came down in front of the cascade and sat down, submerged in a sea of thought.

{{p5}}

It was long after eight when we reached home. I did not feel well at all and went right to bed. All night I was suffering with a fiery fever and called on Baha-Ullah and the Beloved ever so many times. The Doctor told me that I must not work for three weeks and keep perfectly quiet. My goodness! How could I do this? I can't sit quiet or stay in bed even one day. I must be up at 5 or the utmost 5:30 every morning. Doctor is talking through his hat. Isn't he? I am going to be well in a few days.

{{p6}}

In the evening three very important Persian gentlemen came to see the Master. Now and then I could hear him speak with such earnestness and power that it was exhilarating. Although they were Mohamadans, European educators had undermined their faith in the Arabian prophets and the Master was giving them proofs and evidences as to his prophet hood. The enemies had always spread around that the Bahais deny Mohamad- just as our antagonists in the West pretend that we are against Christ- so these Muslims were very much shame-struck and dumbfounded to find Abdul Baha proving to them incontestably the prophet hood of their own divine Messenger. They left the heavenly Presence at about half past eleven wonderfully impressed.

Dear Harriet!

We are all serving at one divine Threshold. It is the service that is valued and not the personality. We are all equal in the sight of the Beloved. In his estimation there is no distinction. His prayer for one is for all. He loves to see every Bahai, a flame of fire burning away the superstitions of men. In the palace of his heart there is no favoritism. We are all standing before him. Often those who are nearest to him are farthest from him. His love is not a respecter of time and space. Anyone who sincerely arises to serve the cause of humanity becomes near and dear to him. His love is universal!

{{p2}}

This morning the Beloved got up a little late, because he retired after midnight. As he rises up and comes out of his room, the rays of the sun of his smile, his words and his Presence warm and illumine the dark chambers of our hearts. I wonder how I could live in the past without his actual presence. True happiness is by his side or in his service. One second of his good-pleasure is equal to an eternity of temporal power. After drinking tea he told me to be ready and go out with him to call on one of the Persian princes who is sick. As his apartment was rather near we walked, but on the way we sat in two parks, a few minutes in each. In the second park the Master sat down on the grass and reclined on a tree trunk. I was also sitting at his left. He made a wonderful picture with the sunshine, the green meadow and the fresh trees around. I wished I had a Kodak with me to take his photograph in this position. Having finally reached the apartment of the Prince, the Master went into his bedroom and for one hour was talking with and consoling him.

{{p3}}

On our return we took an automobile and in the hotel a number of friends were waiting. He called them in one by one and spoke to each personally. with Mr. Holly and his wife he spoke about Mashrekal Azkar and its accessories and what a far-reaching affect will it have when the foundation is laid in Chicago. The Beloved hoped that this will be very soon and that the friends will exert themselves to make it realized.

{{p5}}

with another friend he spoke about singing. He said: Whenever you sing be in a state of supplication and prayer. Sing as though you are praying. Let your song carry with it spiritual effect, an effect which is lasting, long to be continued. Then he came out and delivered the shortest address and yet the most beautiful and comprehensive. It is a jewel of beauty. Here it is: The weather in Paris for the last two days has been clear and the sun has been shining. My hope is that the ideal weather of Paris may also become clear, the sun of reality may shine forth, great spirituality may be obtained, the hearts be stirred, spiritual discoveries be realized, the Luminary which has appeared in the East may down from the horizon of the West and flood these regions with its heart-illuminating rays. This is my desire!

{{p6}}

At four o'clock Mon. Dreyfus had sent a carriage to take the Beloved to Mon. and Madame Richard which is quite far from here. This is the first time the Master is going to their home. They had invited a number of their friends to hear him speak. On the way he spoke to me about the Cause in America.

Mon. Richard and Mon. Dreyfus were at the door to welcome him. We passed through a garden and then into the house. Mon. Richard welcomed the Master in a few gracious words and asked him to speak to them on how they could best serve the world of humanity. He gave a very brilliant and lucid address on the subject which made everyone feel the power of the spirit. A few questions and answers were exchanged, tea was served, the Master shook hand with everyone and he left in the carriage with Mon. Dreyfus. We took a taxi and returned home. The Beloved did not return till late in the evening.

I am writing these pages with a great effort. When I feel better I hope to be able to make up for this loss. But my heart is happy and am glad that in this day and in this hour I am permitted to look daily in the  Face of the Beloved of the world who is the source of all health and safety.

To the believers of God and the maid servants of the Merciful! Upon them he Bahai-ullah El Abha! Stuttgart and Epluigen.

He is God!

Oye Bahais!

There is no greater will in this world so that I may call you; for to be known as a Bahai, it means to be a heavenly, radiant personage and the collective center of the virtues of the world of humanity.

Four letter was received and its contents imparted the utmost of joy; because its significances were the susceptibilities of conscience and the iridescent rays from your luminous hearts. Therefore I supplicated and entreated toward the Kingdom of Baha-Ullah and begged for those Bahais inexhaustible Bestowals- so that day by day you may become more illumined, you may be driven nearer unto God, summoning the people to the Divine Kingdom and become the cause of the spiritual guidance of the souls; thus the shining ray of the sun of reality may illumine that country.

Upon ye be Baha El Abha!

Dear Harriet!

The Anniversary of the Beloved on the 23rd brought forth congratulatory cables from different parts of the America, Europe and the Orient. They were the deep expression of love and happiness. Every one of those cables told the story of the progress of the Bahai Cause all over the world. We must not look at the difficulties that the Cause is beset with from time to time but we must ever think of the end which is the universal spread of the Movement. The trials no matter how severe they are at the moment will spend their forces and pass away, leaving the Cause stronger, sturdier and more powerful; just as when the forces of nature have done their worst, they leave the atmosphere clearer and purer. This Bahai Cause is tested a hundred times, kings and rulers have arisen to rage it to its very foundation and they have failed. So on this very happy day the Beloved answered the cables in words of light and truth This was the first work done this morning. It is a wonderful thing that he lives in Paris and he thinks of all his faithful flock all over the world. I think those people whose names are on the tongue of the Beloved are very fortunate, for in this very thing there is a mystic power.

About half past seven Miss F.Knoblock came to say goodbye to the Master. She is returning to Stuttgart to be with her sister for three weeks and then she goes to America. The Master has showered upon her many blessings and tapping on her shoulder he has often called her "my daughter, my own dear daughter." So this morning she was welcomed with evident happiness. "I am happy, Abdul Baha", she said her eyes dancing with joy and her face wreathed with Bahai smiles. "I leave your presence with the determination of teaching and spreading more and more the Message of the Kingdom of Abha. The Master said: I hope thou will leave Paris as the messenger of the divine Joseph. Carry with thy self wherever thou goest the most great glad-tidings. Perfume the nostrils with the Fragrance of the garment of the divine Joseph. Give thou my greetings to all the believers of God! Rejoice third spirits with then heavenly glad news. I always remember them and beg for each special Confirmations. Give my wonderful Abha greeting to all friends, notably thy sisters, Miss A.Knoblock and Mrs. G.Hannen and her two dear sons. I am very happy on account of the services rendered by Mr. Hannen. He is my son. I pray to Baha-Ullah that the spiritual benedictions and confirmations may ever encircle him. As a parting word the Master said these few beautiful words to her: I shall always keep thee in my mind. I hope that thou mayst be always a herald of the cause of God.

{{p3}}

A girl who is good singer entered. The Master beamed on her asking: Are you progressing in your art? The heavenly song is good. It is my hope that you mayst sing that song. When we left America on the steamer Celtic, there were several musicians and singers. They played and sung every day and every night. When they stopped playing the listeners clapped their hands and all was ended. This was its result. But you must sing a melody as to move and stir the hearts of the Supreme Concourse and its effects may be eternal. The earthly notes and strains are limited as to their influence. The conditions of the world are physical and their importance according to the importance of physical life. Therefore I hope you will find spiritual success whose importance is eternal. Strive that you may be drawn nearer unto God.

{{p4}}

After this he got Ahmad Pasha's address and went out to call on him alone. He came back about noon saying as he entered the room: I spoke much with Ahmad Pasha today. I hope that God will create the effect. He took a very simple lunch in his own room and retired to rest.

{{p5}}

In the afternoon we were drinking tea in his Presence and I was reading to him a newspaper when the telephone rung and I answered. It was from Martha Pension. It seemed that the last few days which the Master was launching there he had told them to let him know when they had vacant rooms. Now having 3 rooms, they had telephoned. With the Master, we went there to inspect the rooms and he was pleased with them. Arrangement was made to move tomorrow to our former hotel. As he was not very well satisfied with his own room, I said it will be well if he would exchange it with mine. He said: Never! I do not desire to decrease one of your comfort. I declare by God that were not for the sake of the Cause, I would have served the friends day and night.

{{p6}}

One must never feel superior to anyone else. This feeling of superiority destroys all restages of friendship and love. I give thee this will to be remembered throughout all thy life:- Whenever thou seest that a person feels to the measure of one atom superior to another or prefers himself to his brother or sister, have no hope in him. He is deprived of the Bounties and Mercies of God.

{{p7}}

He did not go up to his room in the hotel but he bought a small hammer nails etc. from a store nearby. He said: When I reach Haifa I went to go to the mountains and live alone for a while and these instruments will be helpful in pitching up the tents and driving in the nails. We walked through Rue St. Didier to Avenue Victor Hugo and spent half an hour in a store looking over canes and umbrellas.

{{p8}}

We got into a carriage and drove for another half an hour through the Bois de Bologne. Thousands upon thousands were walking or driving or lying on the grass or gliding in fairy-like boats over the enchanting lakes. The Master was meanwhile looking over the great sceneries of verdure and trees. He said: How glorious it would be if these people instead of whiling away their time here with no result, would have gathered together in groups, reading the Hidden Words, singing the praises of God, chanting the communes and prayers! Then this Park would been have transformed into a Paradise of Spirituality and Holiness; but now it breeds the qualities which are not praiseworthy of the world of humanity.

{{p9}}

Mr. and Mrs. Scott's address was given to the driver and the Master was there in half an hour. He rested first. Mrs. Scott read from the hidden Words, Miss Erwin read from the Seven Valleys and gave an interesting exposition of the meaning of the first Arabic Hidden Words. The Beloved came out and gave a glorious speech on "How to advance from the lowest degree of existence to the highest summit of perfection". Madame Richard translated from English for the French Bahais. Then the Master shook hands with each blessing everyone with a few heavenly words and we came out with the greatest of joy and peace. To Mon. Scott he said: Your studio is a radiant place. It is the gathering place of the friends of God. It will have great importance in the future.

{{p10}}

Hardly arriving at the hotel when the Master was up again and we went out to call on Miss Sanderson. He took tea there and spoke with her on the immortality of the soul. Her mother is not felling any better but she is a most devoted, sweet daughter and takes the best care of her by day and by night.

{{p11}}

From her home we came back to the hotel and after a few minutes we were out again driving toward Moneer Pasha's home. Here the Master stayed till 11 o'clock talking with him, his wife and a few other invited guests. The question of the disassociation of the spirit from the body took much time. The wife of Moneer Pasha from her childhood has had spiritual experiences and visitations and she related these things to the Master. Wonderful explanations were given by him. Long after eleven we left the Pasha's apartment and returned to the hotel. Mirza Mahmoud and Sayad Assadullah were up and waiting for the coming of the King.

{{p12}}

As Ahmad Pasha and another Persian had prepared food for the Master and sent it to the hotel he had told our two brothers not to eat dinner downstairs but wait and eat with him; so after our return from Moneer Pasha about midnight we spread an impromptu table and his holy presence we partook of supper. It was a symbol of the divine Table which he has spread before us and from which we partake daily.

Dear Harriet!

Here we are, back again to Martha Pension. The proprietor, the servants and the guests love the Master and show him great veneration and respect. He feels more at home in this than in Baltimore Hotel. Besides it is built in a quieter street. Rue than a large avenue which pulsates with the ever rushing stream and tide of life. In the morning we were all busy packing. The Master always attends to his four handbags of papers. No other person is allowed to do this for him because they may displace the letters or papers he needs most. Although I did not feel well I had to be up and try to perform to the best of my ability my various duties. Never have I appreciated more than now the value of health. I used to enjoy in America and in various parts of Europe. I did not know what is fatigue or sickness. It is alright for a person who has little to do to get sick but those who have many duties to perform must not be attacked. However, I put myself in the mood of the Master and do not give any importance to the bodily failing but look always for strength and health to the source which is the spirit.

{{p2}}

This morning Miss Hodgson came to bid farewell to the Master as she was going with her father to Brittany in the South of France for summer. "Thou art my dear daughter" he told her as they shook hands and she sat down. "I love thee very much. I have heartfelt attachment for thee. Thou will ever be in my memory. Wherever thou goest, teach the Cause. Inform the people about the realities of this Manifestation. The more thou spreadest the glad-tidings, the greater will be thy spirituality. Teaching the Cause of God is like unto the sweet singing of an Artist. The Artist enjoys more the song than an indifferent audience because she has studied for a long time and knows too well the hardships and the sufferings of the student life."

{{p3}}

Miss Cruttwell an English woman came in with Miss Sanderson. She has had just heard about the Movement from her and the reading of a Tablet revealed to New York friends years ago, had entirely transformed her views of life and attracted her to the Cause. She is a writer of novel and articles for the English magazines and at this very time she is engaged in writing a book. Now having heard of the revelation, her greatest desire is to inculcate the Bahai principles in this book. She was all aflame with the Fire of the Love of God and tears of joy flowed from her eyes. She was so overwhelmed with the holy presence of the Beloved that she could hardly say one word. All that she could ask was to receive the blessing of the Master and to remain steadfast in the Cause. Praise be to God the heavenly Voice of the Beloved was heard that the glances of the Favors of Baha-Ullah have encircled thee and thou hast attained to the Knowledge of the Kingdom. The Doors of the Kingdom of God are open before thy face! Happy is thy condition for thou hast attained. i hope that thou will become one of the elect. Be thou ever firm, ever steadfast. Firmness and Steadfastness are the two great attributes of God. Adorn thy self with these spiritual garments. As long as the tree is not well rooted it will not yield luscious fruits. As long as the foundation is not well laid, the building shall not stand for ever.

{{p4}}

Miss Cruttwell took off her hat and knelt before the Beloved, begging for his Confirmations and assistance. The Master putting his hand on her head delivered in a hushed voice the following prayer:- "O Thou Almighty! Direct Thou this traveler toward the Pathway of Thy Guidance! Suffer this thirsty one to reach to the Fountainhead of Thy Bestowal! Confer upon this indigent one an abode in the Neighborhood of Thy infinite Mercy. Let this hungry one sit around the celestial Table of Thy heavenly Food! O God! Encircle her with the glances of Thy Providence! Immerse her in the refulgent sea of Thy Glorious Lights! Grant her the swift wings of Inspiration so that she may soar toward the realm of the exalted ideals and universal Love! Protect her and guard her in Thy Fortress! Verily Thou art the Generous! The Compassionate and the Merciful!"

{{p5}}

Mrs. Lilianthal and Mrs. Beede, Mon. and Madame Mors and others came in and the Master praised the marvelous civilization of France and the high degree of attainment of the people. In the afternoon Ahmad Pasha came in and the Master sat with him in a store next to the hotel and spoke with him in Turkish. At 4 o'clock we moved our trunks and satchels to Marta Pension and by six we were all settled in our new rooms. It was about 9 o'clock when they announced the arrival of Mon. and Madame Richard. Meanwhile the Master had called alone on Rouha Khanom and returned about 8 and went out again to take a walk. They waited for a few minutes and he came in. The conversation started on the indifference of the French thinkers to all religion subjects and how to reach them, on the beliefs of the Sufi adepts on Yod and creation, on Spiritualism and Kindred phenomena. from nine till 12 o'clock they spoke the Master relating some very queer stories about the common beliefs held in the Orient on haunted houses and graveyards. These imaginary ideas have lighted the life of the Orient. They have wrecked many homes and many happy families. They are pure imaginations and superstitions, Abdul Baha said at last. Two of the stories were about the "Jins" and ghosts in Acca. When I feel better I will write them for you because the Master played an important part in each story to break the nation of Jins and ghosts.



### Martha-Pension Family-Hotel 97, rue Lauriston Paris. May 28th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

The other day I was reading a book in which I found a few lines of poetry on divine Love and I would like to quote it here: 

>>"Ah, sweet strange fruit! The which if any taste,
They may no longer keep their lives of old
Or their own selves unchanged, but some divine change
And subtle alchemy comes which can transmute
To some new magical form. Not as before,
Our life comes to us, May, never as before."<<

To the Bahais these simple, true lines convey new significances and more subtle meaning. The Teachings of Baha-Ullah have freed us from past dogmas and imitations and have unfolded before our eyes a new heavenly Vista which heavenly Vista is Universal Love and Universal Charity; love to all the inhabitants of the earth; charity for all the creatures of God. If the alchemy of the words of Baha-Ullah and the matchless addresses of Abdul Baha has not transmuted the gross metals of any prudish selfishness and crude uncharitableness into the pure gold of radiant selflessness and sweet charity- then of course I am not a Bahai- even if I announce it with the flare of trumpet and the fanfare of music. We must show this spiritual transformation in our deeds, words, conduct and behavior. We must demonstrate to the rest of the world, the ideal standard of universal tolerance and heavenly friendship; otherwise we will not be privileged to become the servants and the maid servants of this Cause. A new people shall arise, consecrating their lives to the welfare of humanity.

{{p2}}

Therefore if we desire to manifest Bahai qualities and show to everyone that by eating this sweet, strange fruit we have no longer kept our older selves, we must practice the following precepts which I have gathered from the Garden of Beatitude:

"Blessed is he who is charitable, for he shall inherit Eternal Life! Blessed is he who overlooks the faults of others for he shall enjoy divine beatitude! Blessed is he who associates with all with joy and fragrance for he has obeyed the command of Baha-Ullah! Blessed is he who loves mankind for he has heeded the advice of Abdul Baha! Blessed is he who is kind to his enemies for he has walked in the footsteps of Christ! Blessed is he who proclaims the doctrine of spiritual brotherhood for he shall be the child of light! Blessed is he whose heart is tender and compassionate for he will throw stone at no one! Blessed is he who will speak evil against no one for he has attained to the good-pleasure of the Lord! Blessed is he who will not uncover the sins of others for he will become favored at the Threshold of the Almighty! Blessed is he who has a forgiving nature for he will win the spiritual Graces of God! Blessed is he who diffuses only the sweet fragrances of the flowers of friendship and mutual association for he will obtain a goodly portion of the Bounties of the Merciful! Blessed is he who teaches union and concord for he will shine like unto a star in heaven! Blessed is he who practices loving kindness and cooperation for he will be encircled with celestial benedictions. Blessed is he who comforts the downtrodden for he will be the friend of God."

Today our Beloved spent quietly in the hotel receiving visitors from morning till night. In the morning after drinking tea he attended for an hour or two to his oriental correspondence which is always unwieldy and in large volume. For a few minutes we went into his Presence and received his blessing. As he lives one floor above us we were not informed as to the time of the tea. Mon. Dreyfus came in and brought our mail. he is always welcome because he brings our letters so promptly and regularly. A Russian lady who has interested herself in a band of Indian Musicians arrived and brought five tickets inviting the Master and his secretaries to attend the concert on Friday afternoon. He accepted the tickets with thanks and said he will send us and if he has no engagement he may go himself. Madame Dreyfus came and the Master greeted her most cordially. She has not been feeling well for the last few days but she is much better. A Turkish gentleman entered the Presence and he spoke with him till noon, when he went out to take a walk. After his return he ate his simple lunch in his own room. At four o'clock Halim Bey, a prominent Turkish gentleman came to see him. He spoke with him about his recent trip and gave him eight photos of Stuttgart Bahais. The wife of Moneer Pasha with several other women found their way to the Holy Presence. He spoke with them in detail about the spiritual reality which is in man and is the discoverer of the realities of phenomena. They were much interested and while he was speaking to them the Turkish Ambassador to Spain entered the room. His father knew the Master. He stayed only a few minutes as he had other engagements.

Meanwhile Doctor Mohamad Khan and another newly arrived Persian were waiting for the Beloved. When he finished his work he went out with them and returned about 9 o'clock. As we did not have any callers he retired to his room.

Dear Harriet!

When we look upon the Bahai Cause with an impartial eye, we observe that it is a growing movement. It is growing and unfolding its potential characteristics because it is divine in origin. Mankind is spiritually benefitted and uplifted by accepting its teachings and by practicing  its principles. We have an all sides evidences to the forward march of the Cause. Baha-Ullah today assists those who arise whole-heartedly to spread the Glorious Message of the Kingdom and unfurl the Banner of Universal Love and Charity. It is the hope of each one of us to become a worthy servant at this holy Threshold. We have found the greatest spiritual Movement of the age and we have dedicated our lives and our hearts to it. Every Bahai no matter what his situation and environment must strive to the utmost of his ability to diffuse the fragrances of the rose-garden of Abha. Baha-Ullah has not given us this treasure so that we may hid it under the ground. We must distribute it amongst the poor in soul consciousness; we must let them have a share from this inexhaustible wealth; we must invite them to sit around this heavenly Table; we must lead them to the green bank of this divine River. If we sacrifice our lives to this Cause we have done less than nothing. Who dares to claim for himself any station while the Lord is standing in the Congregation of the Elect! We are all trying to serve, but as to real service accomplished by any of us-not yet-not yet.

This morning the Beloved quietness of his room, No. 12 on the first floor wrote several important Tablet with his own hand and later dictated cables in answer to those he has received.

Prof. Enayet Khan, the Indian musician and Suffi with several other Bahais were introduced into the Presence of the Beloved. At first the conversation was on the study of the Persian language and the deeper, spiritual significances of the Koran, the Master giving us very illuminating interpretations. Prof. Enayet asked a question about Nirvana, the Freedom or Salvation of the soul. The Master said: To attain the Nirvana means to reach perfection. This is made possible through the Bestowals of God. When these are none safed, their man attains to the summit of perfection. A seed has reached to the station of Nirvana once it springs out of the earth, it grows, putting forth trunk, branches, loves blossoms and finally luscious ripe fruits. The fruit is the Nirvana of the tree. This comes through education. The seed became a tree through the training of the gardener. Man attains to perfection through the education of the divine Instructor. His injustice is changed into justice; his greed into trust, his avarice into generosity, his hard-heartedness into pity and charity; in short he will be adorned with all the divine characteristics. The more he acquires these spiritual qualities, the nearer his spirit will be to perfection according to our terminology; but according to Christian idea he will be close to salvation and according to the Hindus he will attain to Nirvana. The object in each case is the same but interpretation differs.

Several other questions were asked which the Master gave elucidating answers. At noon the Master with Mirza Mahmoud and myself were invited to a Persian dinner to the house of Sardar Monsour at 42 avenue de Bourbonnais. The dinner was very elaborate. Before eating, the Beloved told them the story of Baha-Ullah's exile to Acca and the hardship of the first years of Acca; how Abdul Hamid sent a cable to the governor of Acca to investigate the arrival of two Europeans and his wonderful cross-examination in the court room. During the lunch and afterward spoke about futile theology of Mohamadan religion and how a student must study 30 years before he becomes a Mulla. He told many funny stories illustrating these points. It was four o'clock when we left our hospitable Persian prince and his friends.

At five he called Madame Jackson with Doctor Mohamad Khan and then visited Miss Sanderson. He came to the hotel very tired.

I have to be very brief in these days because I am sick myself and feel no better.

Dear Harriet!

To go with the Beloved to the Orient has been my dream for the last two months. I have thought about it by day and dreamed about it by night; for I have fully realized that one hour in his holy Presence was greater in value than many years- may many ages. I had not told him about my secret longing, my holiest desire but this morning he made me the happiest man in this world by telling me that I will accompany him to Egypt. If I had only two wings, I would have soared toward the atmosphere of joy and beatitude! Just think of it! I have been already with him nearly fourteen months, daily watching his heavenly ministrations and now God in his Bounty is going to lengthen this period. "My greatest wish is never to be separated from the Beloved" I told him. And now I feel in my heart the stirring of new emotions as I think of the East and the wonderful privilege of being with the Master and meeting the friends of God! I am very happy and I want every friend of mine share in my happiness. If I had a thousand dollars I would have distributed them amongst the poor for this spiritual gift! My highest desire is to be at all times obedient to the Command of the Master and a willing instrument in his hand. My face is toward the East; my heart and all the Bahai love that it contains is in America. In serving Abdul Baha I am serving the believers in the United States. I am at all-time present to serve them and ready to sacrifice my life for them.

This morning someone came to the Master and asked for money. He told him: Never be a spendthrift. Do not be extravagant in thy expenses. An extravagant person comes always to a sad end and feels the pinch of want and misery. Ever expend less than your income. Do not borrow money for unnecessary things. Although my expenses are much and in different directions. I never expend without thought. If I give money to this or to that or to the children, the results of it will be known in the future. When I was at the age of youth- in Baghdad- I wore a Tarbush for five years tell its reddish color became white and very old looking. My Persian "Gaba" I wore for 5 years, and I never thought that there were new clothes in this world. I never dreamed to borrow money and buy clothes with. I was very happy with what I had. At this time if I did not have the means to pay for this room I would have slept in a cell just as happily and if I could not get the cell I would have gone into the God's country and slept there peacefully never dreaming that there is such a thing as a room.

{{p3}}

Speaking about gluttony and over-eating the Beloved said: "One must eat in moderation. Man is not created for food. He must not indulge in eating too much. Over-eating is the cause of many diseases. Rise from the Table always before you are satisfied. One must have been retrograded to the lowest point as to be perfectly satisfied with eating, drinking and sleeping. The enjoyment of man comes through the unfoldment of his intellect, intelligence, the virtues of the world of humanity and the divine characteristics. Man has two aspects; a spiritual and an animal aspect. His animal side is sustained through food and drink like unto other beasts but his spiritual life is fed by the ideal perfections, faith, assurance, the Knowledge of God and the Love of God. More attention must be given to the latter than the former.

I was sent to the Custom House after a box of Persian tea which has been sent from Alexandria for the Master. Having attended to this work I returned about noon when I found Mon. Dreyfus translating in the Salon. There were a number of seekers present. After this the Master took a walk and we had our lunch. Mirza Mahmoud and myself went to hotel Continental where we were invited to hear the Indian Concert. There were more than 200 people, amongst them many Bahais. Hindu music is so different from Western ideas of music that one cannot compare them at all, however we enjoyed a pleasant afternoon and returned about half past five.

{{p5}}

Last night we received a telegram from Consul Schwarz that he and his wife will be here tomorrow morning. When they arrived they went to Baltimore Hotel and got their rooms. While I was absent they came here and spoke with the Master in English.

He told them to return at six o'clock. Of course I was very happy to see them. They are such excellent Bahais. They presented to the Master the love and devotion of the German friend. He told them: I am most pleased to meet you again in Paris. My heart hears testimony to the fact that the Stuttgart Bahais are most sincere. The days of Stuttgart and your hospitality shall never be forgotten. In reality the believers are united and agreed. The Cause shall progress greatly. Your children are always remembered by me. You have excellent daughter. She is attracted and enkindled. She will become a great teacher in this Cause.

Some souls are withered and do not become interested nor are they set a glow; while others receive the fire of the Love of God immediately. During the few days of our stay in Stuttgart your daughter made marvelous spiritual progress. Other matters were discussed and they left the Presence most inspired.

Mr. Lee came in and the Master praised in the warmest and most eloquent manner Miss Hodgson who has really served the Cause most faithfully.

{{p6}}

Tonight the meeting in Mon. and Madame Dreyfus was very heavenly. The Master in his address introduced in the most sympathetic manner Consul and Madame Schwarz and laid great stress in the unifying power of Baha-Ullah. Before the Master the Consul spoke very nicely in French about the Cause in Stuttgart. The Master took his dinner in Mon. Dreyfus. Everybody in the meeting was happy.

This is a blessed night because Consul Schwarz and his respectful wife have come from Germany with the greatest of longing so that they may associate with you. Consider how great is the power of Baha-Ullah! It is unparalleled and unique in the history of the world. There noble souls have come from Stuttgart, some of those who are present are from America, France and England are well represented in this meeting and we come from far of Persia. Yet the invisible power of the Blessed Perfection has established amongst us a harmony and concord which are eternal. It is impossible to bring about this ideal condition through human agency. The Divine Potency and Dominion are alone enabled to unite these hearts. The powers of humankind establish between the people a kind of communication which is limited in its influence, but the pure love which is cordial, heartfelt and free from all the graces of self and desire, measureless and changeless, is created by the power of God. Today when I looked in the faces of Consul Schwarz and his revered wife, it was as though I met my own dear son and beloved daughter. My joy and happiness was inexpressible. This relation is made possible through the spiritual and Divine Power; other relations such as the family which unites the various members of a family; or patriotic sentiment which brings together the individuals of a nation or racial idea which cements together the social units of a bribe or community; all such relations are limited in their spheres of activity. The love which wields together the members of various nations; divergent races and different religions, and causes them to associate with each other with love and family, that love is divine and celestial in origin; because such a love is spiritual and heavenly, which casts all the various communities and tribes in one universal world of fraternity making organs of one great temple, suffering them to become the members of one family and the inhabitants of one country and uniting them with such an irresistible force that will become indissoluble throughout all eternity. As own union and communication are made possible through this divine power, therefore no power on earth is able to break them. Consequently let us all thank his holiness Baha-Ullah who has brought all of us together, creating amongst us such affinity and cooperation; under the all-protecting shadow of his word, making us all the limits of one body protecting and guarding us from all evil.

He has quickened spirit. He has assisted all with heavenly confirmation and has pitched such a lent under which all nations and people will gather.

He commands us to unfurl the banner of the oneness of the World of Humanity and become the means of the closer relationship between the East and the West, and practicing the doctrine of human solidarity and brotherhood; thus the lights of the Kingdom may illumine the hearts of the inhabitants of the Orient and the Occident.

This is a blessed night because the spirit of reality is waving, the rays of the Suns of Truth enlighten the souls and the minds, the fragrant breezes of Providence are marling, the cloud of Mercy pours down the rain and the breath of the Holy Spirit stirs the heart. The confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha are conducive to the appearance of these spiritual lights, thus distributing amongst us the eternal bestowals and sending to us these revered souls from Germany as heavenly presents.

Dear Harriet!

I am thinking of Mt. Carmel and Acca; of Reziwan Garden and the Blessed Tomb of Baha-Ullah; of many holy men and places that it shall be my privilege to meet and to see. The Orient with all its iridescent beauty; the clearness of its sky; the dazzling brilliancy of its stars; the stillness of its atmosphere; the radiance of its spirituality; the transparency of its ideals- will be unfolded before my wondering eyes like a magic panorama. How I long to steep myself in that lustrous sea of idealism! My true Oriental disposition that was hidden for many years, owing to the active, energetic life of America shall leap forth into being, assisting me to fully enjoy and assimilate all the things that are charmingly Oriental. I have been a wanderer for many years, travelling through strange lands, always finding good staunch friends. This has been made possible through the Favors and Bounty of Baha-Ullah; otherwise what am I and who am I to win even one single friend! I believe that if I thank God all my life, it will not be sufficient. I am not worthy at all but I hope I will become enabled in the future to render great many services to the Cause. I pray daily for greater illumination and spirituality for all the believers of God and for myself. May all of us become the spreaders of joy and not sorrow.

{{p2}}

This morning the Beloved called me very early into his room and for two hours, he spoke on certain subjects pertaining to the future of the Cause. He was in great earnestness and now and then his voice was raised to a very high pitch. When deep feelings, owing to certain outside events encircle his heart, he is divinely irresistible. On these occasions- which are observed rarely by anyone- he is under the entire control of heavenly emotions. Every word he utters is like into a flame, descending from the sky; his two eyes become like unto two burning torches and his Countenance, at every second, while speaking manifest the infinite range of the human and divine susceptibilities!

{{p3}}

He told me to go and call on Consul and Madame Schwarz and take for them on his part a bouquet of roses. I did so and you can easily realize how happy and delighted were they. On my return he was walking in the salon. He said: Consul and Madame Schwarz are very sincere Bahais. I love them very much. They are holy souls. This kind of love is good because it is for the sake of God.

{{p4}}

Later on Mon. Boutaric, a Bahai from Toulouse came in to see the Master. He was greeted with warm cordiality. He gave the details of the progress of the Cause in that city and the interest of the public. The Master told him: When you return, strive in the promotion of the Cause in your midst. Illumine thou the souls. Establish in that city the Center of the lights of God. The Confirmations of God shall descend upon thee.

{{p5}}

Consul and Madame Schwarz with several other believers came in. In introducing these two blessed souls to those who were present the Master beautifully said: These are the hundred petalled roses from the garden of Stuttgart. I hope that all of you will become the sweet fragrant roses of the Paradise of Abha which are never withered. He spoke them in details about the attraction and enthusiasm of the German Bahais.

{{p6}}

At this juncture the brother of the Khedive of Egypt with two other important personages came in and the Master took them into his own room and hold a very long conversation with them. The Master met His Royal Highness the Khedive's brother while travelling in America.

{{p7}}

In the afternoon he called on Consul and Madame Schwarz in Baltimore and for half an hour he talked with them and returned to our hotel. There were a few friends present. One of them said: The world of creation is like unto music. Man is the Sound; woman is the Silence; for this reason I do not sympathize with the violent actions of the alarmist suffragettes. Woman decreases her spiritual qualities by entering into the professional life. The Master longingly remarked: You better not express such ideas before a Suffragette meeting. They will shoot you down from the platform. The time when the woman wanted to be "silence" is passed. I am going to advise the head Suffragette in London that you have a foe to your Cause in the person of. She said for this very strong belief she was shy at speaking in the public meetings, although Abdul Baha has often encouraged her to do so. The Master said: In the Kingdom of God everybody must be "Sound". There is no "Silence". There is no distinction of gender. Man and woman are co-workers and co-partners in the promulgation of the heavenly message.

{{p8}}

Accompanied by myself the Master drove for nearly two hours, calling on different people and it so strongly happened that no one of them was at home. The last call was on Mrs. Lilianthal and Mrs. Beede in International hotel. He wanted for than half an hour but they did not came, having taken a car ride to Versailles. Finally we returned home. Mon. and Madame Richard came to see him and they had a long conversation on spiritual topics. He is teaching them so that when he leaves Paris they may be assisted in the spread of the principles amongst the French people.

Dear Harriet!

Another month is opened and the Beloved is in Paris, teaching and administering to those who are spiritually needy. We are all has King under the sunshine of his universal Spirit. People love him and flock around him. His holy, pure heart knows no distinction of race and nationality. In his estimation they are one. He has the miraculous power of gathering around himself the most divergent elements of society wherever he goes. In future Paris will be proud because the Sun of Reality shone forth from its horizon for such a long time. The Shepherd has been in their midst and his voice has been raised.

{{p2}}

Today we had three new comers from the East. Mirza Jalal who has just returned from Haifa; Mirza Ali Akbar Nah Kjevony from Russia, via Constantinople and Acca, our own Mirza Ali Akbar who was with us in America and Hashmatullah Saheb from Agra, India. We were most pleased to receive these three friends from three divergent parts of the East, showing the unifying power of Baha-Ullah. When Hashmatullah who is a tall Indian young man and who is going to England to complete his studies was presented to the Master, he inquired sympathetically about the believers of Bombay, Raugoon and Calentta mentioning many names. He spoke about natural and divine philosophy but in these days Europe is why studying natural philosophy to the exclusion of the other.

{{p3}}

The name of Mirza Mohamad Reza Shirazi was mentioned, who recently has made an extensive trip throughout India, spreading the message and preparing the way for the coming of Abdul Baha. "Yes" the Beloved said, "I read about it in an English newspaper when I was in London. Consider what a glorious effect has the power of teaching the Cause! I intend to make a voyage to India. I like very much to do so if divine destiny agrees with my plan."

{{p4}}

Mirza Jalal come in and gave them news of Haifa and Egypt. The most effective news was that nearly 50 pilgrims from all parts of the Orient are anxiously waiting the arrival of the Beloved. Some of them have been waiting for more than 5 months. The news of Acca cheered his heart. Acca is the center of this Cause and when good news is received from that center, the rest will be alright.

{{p5}}

Mirza Ali Akbar with happy face went to see the Beloved. He had been through many cities since his departure from America giving the good news of the promotion of the Cause in the United States. He has covered more than 20,000 miles. Leaving America he visited Paris and the friends then he went to Vienna and met some prominent Persians. From Vienna he went to Odessa, Batum, Tiflis, Ganjeh, Bakon, Gersnavonsky, Eshkabad, Marve, Tajan, Gahgahe, Samarkand; then he returned to Eshkabad and by way of Bakon and Teflis went to Irevan, Nahkjivan, JOlfa, Morand and finally Gabriz.

In each one of these cities large meetings were organized where he addressed friends and strangers. Now he returns to the Master laden with spiritual victories but the same humble, quiet, forceful, calm man. When the Beloved heard the names of all the cities wherein he had spoken with the friends he made a sign of pleasure and said: When our enemies exiled us from Teheran, they were dancing with joy because they thought this Cause will come to an end. From Teheran to Baghdad there were only one or two Bahais. The rulers of Persia gleefully exclaimed that he had uprooted the tree of this Cause. Now consider how in all these places there are so many Bahais. A French woman was present and asked questions about the return of Christ and the expectation of the Theosophists. The Master gave her comprehensive answers and she was made most happy.

{{p6}}

At three o'clock we got an automobile and the Master followed by me called on the brother of Khedive in the hotel Imperial in Rue Christopher Colombe. The Beloved read to him the Arabic Text of his address in Oxford and spoke upon other interesting subjects.

{{p7}}

From there he called on the Turkish Minister to Spain who is at present sojourning in Paris. He knew his father the first time Baha-Ullah was taken to Constantinople. Tea was served and the Master spoke on Turkish political poetry and the events which are transpiring now. From here which was 15 Rue de la Nople we drove to Mon. and Madame Dreyfus. They were not in but the Beloved rested for a few minutes and returned to the hotel. here one of the celebrated Persian Editors was waiting and the Master received him with due courtesy and took him to his room to speak with him.

{{p8}}

Afterward Consul and Madame Schwarz came in. They asked many questions about the meetings and how they should conducted. He gave them satisfying answers and they left his Blessed Presence with joy and fragrance. As he sent me out to call on S.M., I returned late and had the privilege of eating with him. Mirza Jalal and Mirza Ali Akbar were in his Presence giving further news about their trips.

Our departure for Egypt will be surely within the next two weeks.

Dear Harriet!

The news that there are 50 pilgrims in Haifa who have arrived  from different parts of the Orient has made a deep impression and the Master is speaking to leave Paris soon. Today he cabled to Ahmad Yazdi in Port said not to forward any more letters, thus showing his determination for an early departure. Just think of the patience of those Oriental Bahais who have been waiting and waiting, some of them for six months, daily looking toward the sea for the arrival of the King of their hearts! We cannot but admire their heavenly endurance!

{{p2}}

This morning as we came down to go to the dining room for breakfast the Master was walking from one end of the salon to the other and Mirza Ali Akbar was relating to him the different anecdotes of his travels. Then he went out to take a walk and on his return S.Z. one of the most prominent nobles of Persia with three other Persians came to pay him a visit. For two hours he spoke on the Cause; on his historical address in San Francisco Synagogue and on the life and teachings of Baha-Ullah. Toward the end he told them the story of an assassin who had killed 75 Bahais and while the Blessed Perfection was in Baghdad he came there and took refuge at the holy Threshold; because he was haunted by his enemies. Baha-Ullah protected him and he would go everywhere with perfect security, declaring that he was the freedman of Baha-Ullah.

{{p3}}

After his lunch in his room he slept for a little while and at half past two he came down stair and spoke with a number of Persians who were gathered together talking about the Persian revolution. At three o'clock Zelle-ul-Sultan, the son of Naserddin Shah and for many years the governor-general of Esphadan came to see the Beloved. He was conducted to his room and there they were together for about an hour. Afterward he told me some of the things they talked about.

{{p4}}

At five o'clock he took with him in an automobile. Mohasser-ul-Molk, the brother of Sardar Monsour, Hashmatullah Saheb, Mirza Ali Akbar and myself to go to the meeting of Mr. and Mrs. Scott. The rest came by subway. There were quite a large number of friends present and after Madame Richard's interesting talk the Beloved gave a short farewell address toward the end of which with ringing voice and eloquent words he dwelt on the Center of the Covenant.

{{p5}}

The automobile of Madame Dreyfus we drove to the home of the mother of Mon. Dreyfus. The master entered her room and was very loving and kind to her. She is in bed and very weak physically. She loves the Master. Whenever his name is mentioned, her eyes are filled with tears. He read over her a short, beautiful prayer and most touchingly kissed her forehead.

{{p6}}

Then we quickly drove to Mon. Dreyfus where he rested for a few minutes, drunk a cup of coffee and was driven again to Madame Jackson's home. We waited for a few minutes before she was ready to receive us. She was sitting on a chair. Her sister, her niece and another woman nurse her and attend to all her physical needs. The Master spoke with her very beautifully about the glories of the other life and how he hoped that they will meet each other there; in that world of light wherein there will be no separation. Her eyes were filled of tears. The Master arose from his seat and kissed her head once, twice and thrice. It was the most heavenly scene that I had ever seen. He was the embodiment of gentleness, compassion and spiritual sympathy. "I will always remember you and will pray for you" was the parting word as he left her room probably never to be seen again.

{{p7}}

We drove to Hotel International where we were the guests of Mrs. Lilianthal for dinner. Consul and Madame Schwarz, Mon. and Madame Dreyfus, Mirza Jalal and Mirza Ali Akbar, Mirza Mahmoud and Sayad Assadullah were amongst the invited guests. At a quarter of nine everybody was sitting around the beautifully decorated table; the Master at the head. Conversation was carried alongb quietly amongst us, now and then then Master adding a few divine word. After the dinner we came into the reception where coffee was served and for nearly an hour reincarnation was the topic of discussion. Then the master thanked most beautifully Mrs. Lilianthal for her reception and we walked back to the hotel.

Glory be unto the Lord who hath illumined the world of ideals with the lights of Baha-Ullah! Praise be unto the Maker of the heavens and earth who hath opened the doors of the Kingdom of Might! Thanksgiving be unto God who hath ushered in the age of radiance! Majesty be unto the King of Kings who has appeared riding on the white clouds of power and potency! Glorification be unto Abdul Baha who has propagated the heavenly Teachings in all parts of the world! Commendation be unto the Holy-Spirit who hath inspired the hearts of the faithful ones to arise in his Service!

{{p2}}

This morning an intelligent member of the order of the Star of the East by appointment came to see the Beloved and she talked really with such understanding and clear conception that I was surprised. The Beloved then spoke on the conditions of the second coming of Christ and how they were all fulfilled in the Personality of Baha-Ullah! She listened most attentively to all his explanations and she left his Presence inspired with anew courage and a new hope.

{{p3}}

Madame D'Astre came telling the Master about her approaching journey as a nurse to Constantinople; Consul and Madame Schwarz, Mon. and Madame Dreyfus and many others, each one receiving the great blessing of his divine words. At two o'clock the Beloved accompanied by Mirza Jalal went to call on his daughter and returned about four.

{{p4}}

At five Sardar Monsour with his brother called on the Master and with him we drove to Imperial Hotel to call on the brother of Khadine. The Beloved introduced the three representative men of Persia and Egypt to each other, thus establishing a link of ideal communication between them. Then they started to talk on the closer union of the East and of the West, the better relations between the various nations and religions of the Orient and the removal of misunderstanding from amongst them. The Beloved spoke at this important meeting in very eloquent Turkish, reciting stories of ancient time illustrating the valor, the civilization and the courage of those old nations under all emergencies.

{{p5}}

Returning to the hotel and after an hour of rest Consul and Madame Schwarz came to say goodbye as they were going to leave tonight at 9 o'clock for Stuttgart. They had brought a box of chocolate for the Beloved and he accepted it blessed it and gave it back to them to carry with them and on his behalf give one to each of the Bahais and two to each one of their children. He showered upon them his wonderful blessing and on their departure he embraced Consul Schwarz and kissed him many times. They are certainly the elect in the Kingdom of Abha.

In speaking to these two divine souls the Master gave a detailed description of Mary Magdalene's firmness and steadfastness in the Cause of Christ and how she alone was instrumental of making the shaking feet of the Apostles firm. Then he said: "Therefore I love her very much."

Consul and Madame Schwarz expressed regret at their early departure and their inability to stay longer. The Beloved said: You are with me and you are in my heart. You are not going away. You are in my presence. After a moment of silence he raised his divine voice and addressing them he said: Convey my wonderful Abha greeting to each and all the believers of God and say: His Holiness Christ saw that people shall come from all parts of the world, from remote countries and enter into the Kingdom shall go out. Now how many inhabitants of Persia are deprived of the Graces of His Holiness Baha-Ullah and you who are from the remote places of the earth have entered in the Kingdom of the Blessed Perfection. Therefore you must render thanksgiving unto the Lord of Mankind that ye are in the utmost state of joy and happiness and that God through his own mercy hath chosen you and granted you entrance into his divine Kingdom. The value of this Bestowal is not known at present; it will become appreciated in the future. The spiritual station of the Apostles who entered in the Kingdom of Christ was not known in this own days. When Mary Magdalene embraced the Cause of Christ no one gave any importance to her, no one ever mentioned her name. Outwardly not the least importance was attached to them; but it became known afterwards and the great privilege of entrance into the Kingdom of Christ was appreciated. Similarly because you have entered in the Kingdom of Baha-Ullah in this day, your station in not understood in the future. When the seeds are hidden beneath the soil there is nothing to attract the attention of the passersby; but when these seeds grow into well-laden shepherd and when many has vests are gathered, then it will become manifest. I hope to receive always good news from you; such glad news that may impart joy to the hearts of the friends in the Orient; so that they may speak about your good services in their assemblages. May you be drawn nearer unto God day unto day! May you become more illumined day unto day! May your number increase day unto day! May your love and affection be argumented day unto day! The attainment to this Supreme and ultimate station depends upon firmness in the Covenant of God in this day! Therefore I exhort you to be steadfast in the divine Covenant. You are always in my mind. Your attraction, enkindlement and sincerity in the Cause are never to be forgotten. Your faces are in my heart. I will remember you always and ever pray at the Threshold of Baha-Ullah for your assistance and Confirmation.

Mon. and Madame Dreyfus were present at this meeting and as the Master spoke about Mary Magdalene they told him about a play on the stage in the theatre Chatelet about her life and requested him to go and see it. The Beloved accepted their invitation and at a quarter of nine they came with automobile and took him away to the theatre. It was about midnight when he returned and I have no doubt he has enjoyed it. I will in time ask about his impressions.

Dear Harriet!

Mr. Horace Holly's book on the Bahai Movement from many standpoints is significant. He writes on the social, economic and philosophic aspects of the Cause and shows clearly the sublime beauty and simplicity of these teachings. He brought the first proof for a few hours and I glanced over the various chapters. The publisher will have it ready for circulation within the next few weeks and I believe every Bahai must avail himself of the opportunity of acquiring one copy. It is a book that needs study.

{{p2}}

The art of writing is 20 wonderful; the genius of expressing one's thoughts clearly and unequivocally get more wonderful. The more we have able writers and thinkers in the Bahai Cause the richer we shall be. To everyone a gift is given and those who are fortunately endowed with the gift of writing they must develop it. When God in His bounty gives us the Capital we must use it in the proper channels and invest it with sagacity and wisdom; otherwise it will be taken away from us. Writing preserves for future generations the soul, the longing, the mind of the writer and thus the future and the past are linked together by an invisible tie.

On the other hand a man who expresses lofty ideals on the moral aspect of humanity, must first translate those ideals in his daily life- then he will become able to influence the lives of others. The message and the messenger must become one and flow into each other. This is the difference between the prophets and the philosophers. The prophets lives his message every hour of the day and night; to the philosopher, his ideals are like unto suite of clothes which he may put on or take off. Whenever the world needs a dynamic example of life and ideals, God sends a prophet; thus the old message is lived again, becomes vocal and finds a living expression. In this sense Abdul Baha is today an "Ambassador to Humanity"; the Ambassador of a burning message of love and friendship. When one reads his message on paper- as it is already separated from the messenger- one may not be moved by it but when one listens to his words falling from his holy lips one realizes that the message and the messenger have become one and that at all but deeds. One cannot write or say enough of the wondrous influence of his spiritual life, his deep-rooted rectitude and his divine, beatific ideals. Singly and alone he has been able to conquer the world. Without an army without worldly influence, wealth and position, he rules over the realms of hearts and minds. For forty years he withstood the hardships and vicissitudes of prison life and finally he defeated with the force of love all his enemies. The banners of two despotic Kings were brought down and the banner of Abdul Baha was unfurled over distant countries! This is through the irresistible power of God! Before this great, unparalleled victory, all the victories of the world dwindle into insignificance! The traces of this victory shall cover the face of the earth and regenerate the world of humanity and usher in the age of Peace and Love.

This morning a few letters from America were read to the Master but he did not have time to answer them. He was glad to hear the news however, notwithstanding his many engagements, he has found time to write many Tablets with his own hands which means so much to those who receive them. He sent me out to call on various persons presenting his greeting and salutation. Have he thinks of everyone, hath great and small! About eleven o'clock he came down and spoke at length on divine happiness which is ever the same and unchangeable. He exhorted the friends to gain entrance into the gardens of heavenly beatitude and call the flowers of ideal significance. He hoped that they will overlook the world and its chameleon conditions and will ever gaze toward the heavens of spiritual joy. In short his heart to heart talk made a deep impression and we carried with ourselves a higher realization of his exalted power.

With Mirza Jalal he went out and payed a long call on Rachid Pasha who has moved from his old apartment to a new quarter. On his return he took his simple lunch in his own room and at 3 o'clock I found myself sitting beside him in automobile driving toward the Imperial Hotel to call again on the brother of Khedine. Here the Master met a Syrian naturalist and had a lively discussion with him on divine and natural philosophy. The naturalist become very much interested but after half an hour in company with the brother of Khedine, the Master called on Sadar Monsour by appointment. Tea was served and for two hours happy and intimate conversation continued. The apart, of Sadar Monsour is beautifully furnished with Oriental draperies and Persian rugs and these interesting objects were shown to the brother of Khedine before we left. Sadar Monsour's personal automobile was waiting for us down stair and after the exchange of true Oriental courtesies we were again driven to our hotel. He rested for half an hour and then he went out followed by me to call on Mon. and Madame Dreyfus. They were not in and we returned.

{{p6}}

On our way he bought some cherries but before reaching the hotel he had distributed them amongst the children in the street. The children know him by this time and every time they see him they gather around him. He said: These are my friends. Their parents may not understand the love that I entertain for them. They may ask of themselves, why this Eastern man loves so much our children, while in reality there exists between us no racial or family relations! And he gave the last handful of cherries to a little girl and kissed her on both cheeks.

In the evening Mon. and Madame Richard came for another interview and Doctor Mohamad Khan acted as interpreter.

Dear Harriet!

The greatest gift of religion is the bestowal of internal peace and the attainment of spirit to a calm, undisturbed equilibrium. Neither philosophy nor science offers to a world shaken with the contrary minds of unbelief and agnosticism such a balm of conscious peace. The present day religions are so hoodwinked by blind dogmas and ecclesiasticism that they have forgotten the old, true Teachings and are clinging to the ropes of sand. Their lanterns being extinct, they cannot show the royal Pathway to the wonderers in the wilderness of doubt and hesitation. Nor the various Societies or organizations which have incorporated in their platforms lofty ideals and humanitarian principles are able to establish the Kingdom of eternal peace in the empire of our hearts. All the present day institutions make the confusion worse confounded and to the clash and noise of human world.

{{p2}}

The religion of Baha-Ullah is the only living religion to read just human tendencies and to grant man the desired praise and serenity. This regeneration is brought about, not because, this religion contains a set of divine principles but because it is energized by a dynamic personality such as that of Abdul Baha. He alone- as the Perfect Man- is able to confer upon the person that desired internal Peace which is capable to make him calm, equip-praises and spiritual. Having reached to that high station wherein no event disturb the balance of our consciousness, we have acquired the greatest Favor of God.

{{p3}}

The pleasures of the world and their alluring tinsels distract the mind and dissipate our God-like faculties. Only by turning our faces toward the Kingdom of Abha, wherein, Abdul Baha eternally dwells, do we find that peace which passeth all understanding. The establishment of an external peace amongst nations will be only a faint symbol of the Peace to be established in the hearts of men. Today the hearts are too easily swayed by the conflicting emotions, various interests and contradictory reports; lacking that heavenly serenity, that ineffable calmness, that sweet content which alone descend from heaven. The brood effluence of light which radiates from the Spiritual Personality of the Beloved must illumine every heart and banish away the habgoblins of despair and hopelessness. The great awakening sooner or later must come in the life of each individual; otherwise he has lived a most prosaic life, contenting himself with the shell instead of the kernel.

{{p4}}

The sea of Light beckons us to go onward, to rush forward and be immersed in it. In that sea we will not be drowned but light footed, we will walk over its marmoreal surface or ride over the high crest of its tumultous waves or swim dexterously from shore to shore or dive to its calm depth, wherein, we will behold the wonders of God's creation. Once immersed in that sea all the human qualities are dropped away; the fallen will rise to the heaven of glory; the lame will walk, the dumb will speak and the satanic attributes transfigured into angelic characteristics. Then one finds that internal Peace, the lustrous hues of which shall add charm and attraction to his life and added beauty and sublimity to his nature.

Today I was busy all morning translating an excellent report by Mr. Jos. H. Hannen on the activities and festivities of the New York Convention. The Master called me early to dictate Tablets but as I had started to translate the first report at hand- that of Mr. Hannen- he was so pleased with it that he told me to go back and finish translating it as he desired to show it to some very prominent Persians. It was a report of twelve typewritten pages and it took me all morning to translate. Immediately Mirza Mahmoud was put to work to write two copies- one for Sardar Zafar and another for Sardar Monsour. Copies will also be made to be forwarded to Oriental Assemblies.

In the afternoon the Master called on important Turkish and Persian personages to bid them farewell; and now and then he was in the hotel speaking with new callers. He asked me to write the address of those whom he desired to see on pieces of paper. He would then call a taxi, show the address to the driver and enter in.

{{p6}}

In the evening the Master, Mirza Mahmoud, Sayad Assadullah, Mirza Jalal, Mirza Ali Akbar, Hashmatullah, Doctor Mahmoud Khan and myself were invited to a Persian supper in the house of Mon. and Madame Dreyfus. The Beloved enjoyed the supper very much and it was about half past ten when we walked back to the hotel behind the King of Kings. Tonight I dreamed I am in Port Said and Haiffa, walking on the mountain of the Lord.

Dear Harriet!

So far as I know nextweek  the Beloved shall  said  Eastwood from Marseilles. After nearly  6 months sojourn in Europe and after  the diffusion of the lights of the Kingdom of Abha , the sun of God's Covenant shall  again shine from the Eastern horizon. It will be the work of future  
historians  and thinkers to marshal the most  important facts of Abdul  Psaha's American and European  tour and focus them before the gaze of generations yet unborn. For the present we are too near the heavenly luminary and we cannot portray the right properties of light and shade. There must needs be a power of reflection historic mind and the concentrated force of poetic imagination and sublime insight into the spiritual value of every event connected with the Western ... Master's in order to describe and give to its exact significance in the history of the Bahai world. But today we have have no time for such interpretations of the his deeds and words. We have hardly time to record them; how much more to weigh them with our puny intelligence. This is the season of seed-sowing and any other work will have limited results. We must arise with the utmost sincerity and devotion to raise the Call of the Kingdom and unfurl the Banner of the  Oneness of the world of humanity. This is the most important affair. The Master has practically finished his work in the West. It is now the time for the friends of God to walk in his path, to spread his Teachings and to become imbued with his attributes.

{{p2}}

It is of course the greatest joy and privilege of my life to accompany him where ever he goes! In this world there is no greater honor than this! Six months ago and I could not realize this; three months ago I could see it very dimly and now although i cannot see it very clearly, because it is too gloriously dazzling - yet I can see it better than dimly. I can tell you without exaggeration that if they had made me to choose between the wealth of an American multi-millionaires and the servitude of Abdul Baha, I would have chosen eagerly and happily the latter. Thraldom at his Threshold is glory; death in his path is life. No one on the face of the earth is worthy to stand one moment in his holy Presence even the essence of sanctity is ashamed to show an a appearance in his Court, because the sanctity of Abdul Baha does not belong to this earth, it is heavenly. therefore, were it not for his pure bounty and favor, his ineffable sweetness and patient fault-covering, we could not stand the majesty of his station and the grandeur of his love. His Mercy like unto the sun shines upon the just and the unjust alike. The fruits of the tree of his existence are shared by all the children of men. His luminous ideas like unto the searchlight pierce through the impenetrable darkness.  
From the fountain of his heart, the river of life flows on and on. His bestowals are not suspended and his Graces are continuous. His love and kindness are genuine, The flowers of the garden of his mind are never fading. The simplicity of his conceptions is miraculous and the verdant meadow of his being is starred with delicate primroses and odorous violets.

{{p3}}

This morning the Beloved was happy and well and as he came down he as he came down he asked me to call on his half on some people which I did with great pleasure. On my return a few Americans, Parisians and Turkish eager to hear him were sitting in the room. Each person was asking question and the Master was answering them. He spoke about the wonderful power of faith and how it transforms man from the lower to the highest station of life. Faith changes the crown of thorns into the diadem of Jewels.Today all the crowned heads the world are hundred before that crown of thorn.

One of the present ladies had two <unreadable> in the school and asked the Master to pray for their success. Mrs. More asked several questions about the evolution of matter and the spirit and satisfying answers were given. Their Ahmad Pasha came and invited the Master to his house for tonight where several lately arrived Pashas are also invited to meet him. He accepted it and asked the Persian friends to attend the meeting in Mow Dreyfus apartment which they did except myself; for I did not feel well now have I the last few weeks.

How glorious it would be if we could truly appreciate the heavenly Bounties with which we are surrounded! Our divine Maker in his love and affection has granted to us every means of spiritual enjoyment. Day unto day his favors are becoming more manifold! He bids us to take a goodly portion from these celestial Bestowals and invites us graciously to enter in the Congregation of the elect. He exhorts us to purify our cars so that we may hear the etherial music of the angels and He reminds us to cleanse our hearts in order that He may come and abide therein forever. He desires that the Bahai world may live so unitedly and happily together so as to have the appreciation of one family! Today {{p2}} I received a beautiful letter from Blanfield in London in whose apartment the Master stayed during his sojourn there. I would like to quote herein just one paragraph showing her deep sincere appreciation:-"Was even such a glorious time for one family, since the time of Christ! it seemed historical,  poetic, dramatic, divine! A History such as is written in the History Book of Creation or rather in the annals of heaven...I suppose it would take  thousands of years to realize how near we have been to someone so Divine as He. There are many today who play a part in this Drama, and we too one day may hope to. We shall never forget our Friend, we  shall remember Him all our lives and even afterwards: such must be the feeling and  the emotion of every Bahai, because once we drink from the spring of life and quaff  the chalice of divine Bounty we are eternally satisfied and always ready to  sacrifice our lives for him.

{{p3}}

This morning the Beloved called me into his Presence and asked dear Sayad Assadullah to bring tea. Mirza Jalal was also present. Speaking about Khosro his cook and attendant who was going with him to America but was detained in Naples and sent back he said:-Khosro is in reality very sincere. On our first trip in Europe he served us very faithfully. He served most willingly all the Persians friends. He clothes and shined their shoes. He would laughingly say, when I return to Palestine people will come and ask me you have been in Paris. What did you see? How is Paris like I would say, Paris is like a Kitchen, a small, narrow Kitchen. This, because he was most of the time in the Kitchen and did not have any opportunity to go out sightseeing. However, he was loved by everyone. I was sorry to lose him in Naples. Muza Jalal told several stories about Khosro's inventive genius and how he is extremely clever in handling every kind of instrument.

The contents of a few letters received from Newyork, Los Angeles and San Francisco were presented to the Master. Another cabb was received from Haiffa telling us about the 50 pilgrims and what should they do.  An answer was sent that assuredly within two weeks we will be in Port Said.

{{p5}}

A number of the believers came in amongst there Mr Scott. The Master told him: In this ephemeral world there is no greater joy for me than the meeting of the friends of God. Whenever I see them involuntarily, I am made happy. I love to see you very after. I shall never forget you; because your heart is the expression of your face. It is very pure, very clear and transparent. I hope someday you will cause to the Holy Land and there we will meet each other. I trust that in Paris you may because well-known in Bahai life and Character, to such an extent that every one may become astonished!

With another Bahai he spoke about Joanne of Arc and her dauntless courage;-"The voices that she did hear from childhood were not outward, physical voices. They were spiritual revelations in her heart. It is very strange that the Popes in the beginning anathematized and excommunicated her from the church, but now they have canonized and made her a saint. At first, they said, that she was deprived from the Fairies of God and are denied lived in the center of her; now they say, she intercedes before the Throne of the Almighty for their sins! Under any circumstance, the Popes change if opinion shows conclusively the fallibility of their judgment.

{{p7}}

He came down and the question of teaching and spreading the Cause of God was discussed He said;-" Today, it is evident that the promotion of the word of God depends upon teaching and awakening the souls. For the execution of this great deed Baha-Allah has given us a heavenly Power. It is with this Power that the Bahais are attracting the people of all races and nations to the Kingdom of Abba!  They have no other instrument except this.For the last ninety years the Western Missionaries have gone to Orumieh. They have built schools, hospitals and other charitable institutions in order to convert people to our so-called Christianity but during all this time they have not been able to attract one soul. This is because they have the machine but not the spirit. In Tiberias the Missionaries have built a modern hospital and clinics. The doctor has been serving there for 32 years. Atleast every year one thousand Jews enter the hospital and go out healed, but now of them became Christian. The doctor used to tell me that he was at his wits end in thinking out the {{p8}} reason of the success of the Bahais in the propagation of their teachings.  Without any means at the disposal they succeed to make these Jews Bahais but with all these hospitals and schools and charity we don't seem to succeed. Why is this? I told him:-Think for our moment over this sigulor fact. The Jews who became Christians after the Apostolic age were not attracted to the Christian doctrine by hospital and schools because they had more of these. On the contrary, they were beaten, persecuted and killed. Not withstanding these things they accepted Christ. Why was this? Because these early teachers possessed the "heavenly power". With that power they were enabled to carry the gospel into district lands. Now in this day the Bahais are teaching the people with the same divine Power. They are baptized with the power of the Holy Spirit have forgotten ego and are soaring toward the Kingdom Sanctity. The most effecient capital of the Bahai teacher is the divine power.  Through that alone he can conquer the cities of the hearts.

Speaking with another person he said:- Our  aim is these universal civilization of  mankind. We desire to see all nations walking amicably in the high road of progress. The pathway is very broad and they will not crossed out each other this globe is our native land. How regrettable it is that today all the nations strive to advance their over especial interest to the exclusion of the neighbors, while our watchword is "the perfection of all humanity along all the degrees of civilization without limitation or  restriction!

In the afternoon the Master with Mirza Ali Akbar, Doctor Mohammad Khan and myself drove through the beautiful Boisde Balague. We came down near a wonderful pasteure of navigated flowers. He walked around and admired the artistic arrangements of the beds of so many flowers and of such rich, lustrous colors; then we drove to the Caseade and walked under it. It was a great sight! Then he walked toward the Caseade Pavillion and enteres it. Here we drank tea in his presence. There was a bridal party and that interested the Beloved very much. After that we drove back to the hotel. The {{p11}} Master was invited tonight for dinner by Sardar Mausour.

Dear Harriet!

The fresh and unfailing enthusiasm of Abdul Baha is a miracle of not only this age but of all the past and for all the future ages. Singly and alone he stands in a world run amuck with pessimism and hopelessness as a supreme example of happy inspiration, uplift and optimism to all mankind. The intense fanaticisms of the Eastern religionists against him, the early deprivation and  reicissitudes, the subsequent persecutions and sufferings, the confiscation of all his estate an exile over many lands and seas, the close incarceration and confinement in the penal colony of Acca. The dramatic and tragic events of forty years imprisonment all these sorrowful happenings capable to break the straight will under their weights have passed over him, leaving behind no mark of bitterness against his fellow men. Today he is a source of joy and exultation to thousand upon thousand in all parts of the world. The more I think over this one fact of the life of the Beloved, the greater becomes my devotion and adoration for him. When I review before my mental eyes all the harrowing details of his epic life and when I see him daily brimming over with fiery enthusiasm, attraction and enkindlement, miracle is this! It is greater than all the miracles attributed to past prophets. The flowers of the garden of his heart are ever blooming, scattering Fragrance to all parts. The tress of his orchard are yielding luscious fruits and all mankind are eating thereof.

This morning we had the pleasure to welcome four believers from London; two Persians, two Londoners. Mirza Ali Akbar Rafsanjani and Mirza Lotfollah Ha Kim arrived very early, because they have been traveling all night but Mrs. Benjamin and Mrs. Heriot came later. The Master inquired from both about the London friends and they gave a glowing description of the many meetings which are held in different parts of the city. Praise be to God," the Beloved said, that the Light of Guidance hath shone forth, the Morn of Generosity hath appeared the Providence of God is all enriching; your eyes are being opened, your hearts are united together, your spirits are familiar with each other and you have be held the rise of the Sun of Eternity. Although the eyes are very far from the sun, notwithstanding this, they can see its majesty and its glory. Therefore capacity is necessary; the spiritual nearness does not depend upon shape and time. I hope that we will be together in the divine world; in that holy and radiant world which is sanctified from all environments. We were together in the mineral, vegetable animal but the human kingdom is narrow and dock. I twist that we will meet each other in that realm which is infinite and which is luminous.

{{p3}}

With another person he spoke about the Love of God, for when we possess that wonderful Bounty, we possess everything else Little by little his room was filled with the believers who have come to bid him farewell. He asked of one whether he loves Paris. The answer came in the affirmative. Then he said: "I love the believers in Paris, not the walls and the houses. The walls do not protect one from his ego. One must become the embodiment of divine love. This is the greatest fortress. Praise be to God that our relation is purely spiritual. Consider how the Love of God has united us together. We are associating with each other in the utmost of unity and love.

Outwardly I am leaving Paris but my spirit will be always with you. After me, you organize meetings speak in the gatherings, be always full of joy and beatitude so that day unto day you may become more spiritual,  more radiant, more heavenly. Your duty is to serve the world of humanity through every channel, through every means. This is my hope for you.

He came down and gave another wonderful talk about taking care of the orphans and those who are in utter need. 

He went out to take a walk and on his return he ate in his own soon and rested for a while. At 4'oclock Moneer Pasha came and had a long talk with the Master about the objects of the Baha’i movement.

{{p5}}

Mrs. Benjamin and Mrs. Heriot came in; because they were going to leave tonight for London, the Master invited them again to come and drink tea with him. They asked many questions about their weekly meeting and toward the last the Beloved told them to carry his greeting and love for the London Baha’is and tell them: Praise be to God that the lights of Bahaullah have environed you. I am most pleased with you, because you have arisen faithfully to diffuse the Glad tidings of the Kingdom of God. You will become greatly assisted and you shall with the aid of Bahaullah, hoist the banner of goodwill amongst all the nations of the world. You are very beloved to me. I always remember you. I hear testimony that you are sincere and that your faces are turned toward the Kingdom of Abha Arise with ye with the greatest effort to serve the Cause, to create love in the hearts and to promulgate the word of God. Praise be to God that ye are the active members of the Cause. Increase your activity in the path of greed. Through great joy, you must soon toward the heaven of reality. All the prophets and sanctified souls have yearned for this day and you have attained to it without any labor on your part. Therefore appreciate it.

Two Persians came in to see him. They had also just arrived from London. He spoke to them in detail about his American tour and related the contents of some of his addresses in San Francisco. They were of course never seen him before. It was very late when he ascended the stairs and entered his room. Sayod Asssaullah had his simple suffer ready.

Dear Harriet!

Four more presentations and the "heavenly drama" in the west will he closed, the curtain shall come down and the spiritual artist shall retire! The whole Western world has acclaimed him as the supreme and unique figure of this age and all other ages. He came to the West with the Sun of Reality in his mind and the garden of the Holy Spirit in his heart. These lights, he spread broadcast and these sweet fragrances he diffused all around. He blew in the trumpet and a {{p2}} resurrection was set up, the dead arose from their tombs, the ears were unstopped, the deaf became hearing, the dumb found eloquence, the halting and the lawe walked like unto gazelles, the blind received sight; the cold winter of unbelief changed into the balmy springtime of faith; the sea of divine generosity set in motion; the depressed ones received a goodly portion; the poor became rich, the despondent hopeful; the pearls of wisdom and knowledge were distributed. The doors of the Kingdom of Abha were flung wide; the gates of the paradise of the Lord of Hosts were opened and mankind entered therein to listen to the heavenly nightingale, singing the mystic anthems of brotherhood and universal Peace {{p3}} more than ever."

About 4 o'clock he called again on Rouha Khanom. On his return there were present our Jewish friends. He spoke with them about the coming of the Lord of lords in this latter day. He also encouraged them to speak about the extreme hospitality of the Oriental Baha’is to those Western Baha’is who were present at this interview. Then he went out to call on our many Turkish Pashas who have gathered just at this time in Paris. This last month the Beloved met many of the most prominent {{p4}} life of future generations. I do not know whether I shall succeed in this service, but be confident that I will do my best. There, in the heart of the East, the life is much sweeter the view of existence flows with gently rhythms and with a majestic calmness and limpid tranquility; here in the West life is a turbulent, waving sea, always tumulus. The mountainous waves of intellectual activities and giant like industrial undertakings dash furiously against the enchantments of human lives, washing away the destruction brought. How many ships are wrecked on this active, surging sea and how many lives are totally last! I shall try to depict to you the clam and contemplative East, the nobleness and gentleness of that tranquil river of life.

This morning the Beloved sent me to call on three important Persians to deliver his messages of love and to show them the translation of the Report of the Mashrekol Azkar Convention in New York as written by Mr. Jos. H. Hannen. They were all very interested and thought the feasts must have been very wonderful and the Bahai Cause taking greater hold of the people. On my return Mon. and Madame Dreyfus and a number of other friends were present. They handed me a letter which happened to be from your sister, Mrs. Inglis. The Master asked me from whom have I received the letter? I said it was from Mrs. Inglis, {{p6}} Mrs. Magee's daughter. There he said to all those who were present: I love all the members of the family of Mrs. Magee. It is a very blessed family. Whosoever enters in their apartment, returns very happy and rejoiced. Mrs. Inglis is one of the Baha’i women in America that I love and admire very much. She is my real daughter. She is the embodiment of the nobility and gentleness, very attracted and enkindled. Her husband is an excellent man, with real determination and firm resolution. I was very pleased to meet him. He is a true man. Mrs. Magee has another daughter. She writes to us after the news of the Cause. She informs us of what is going on in America. She also spreads our news amongst the different assemblies. 

{{p7}}

She is a very active, very pure girl. She loves the Cause very much. Once 
I was in meeting, Mrs. Ingles was asked to play Audrey. She did so, but with the greatest dignity and refinement.  Everybody applauded her. Then he looked toward me; but he said with a twinkle in his Eyes Mirza Ahmad applauded her the most. He laughed everybody laughed.

Persian came with his wife and the Beloved talked with them a great deal, relating stories which I had never heard before. A cable was dispatched to American to forward all letters directly, Port Said.

After the general meetings down {{p8}} stairs, he went out to call on Ahmad Ezzat Pasha. At four o'clock he took a carriage all by himself and went out to pay his last visit on Moneer Pasha and his wife.

On his return he called on Miss Sanderson, met her mother, spoke to both of them very beautifully giving their heavenly consolation. He walked for hours through different avenues and with Mirza Jalal I followed him.

It was about half past nine we reached the hotel and at 10 o'clock Mon. and Madame Richard come in and had another long interviews with the Beloved.

I do nothing but talking about early departure from Paris. I want to fly away.

Dear Harriet!

At last we shall leave after morrow for Egypt - the land of Mystery. We are full of joy and happiness, because the glorious Sun of the Covenant shall again arise from the Eastern horizon and illumine the hearts of those believers who have blew deprived of the refulgent lights for a long time. There must be a great wisdom in his long stay in Europe - the cradle of militarism and wars. There is no doubt that his long presence will at last create a salutary effect. We hope very much that these contending nations will learn from him the sweet lesson of Peace and Salvation.

This morning he called Mirza Ali Akbar and Mira Latfallah of London to his Presence and giving them the necessary instructions, commanded them to leave today for Stuttgart; stay there a week, associate with the friends and then return to London. About 11 o'clock I went with them to Gare de l'Est, bought their tickets and started them on their way; sending a telegram to Mr. Heirigel to meet at the station.

{{p3}}

The other Mirza Ali Akbar was sent by the Beloved to Cook's office to buy our tickets. Before eleven o'clock Persian and Americans, Turks and Parisians called to say bon voyage and with each Abdul Baha spoke affectionaly and tenderly. Many of them cried because "we have learned to love you now than ever."

{{p4}}

About 4 o'clock he called again on Rouha Khanom. On his return there were present our Jewish friends. He spoke with them about the coming of the Lord of Lords in this latter day. He also encouraged them to speak about the extreme hospitality of the Oriental Baha’is to those Western Baha’is who were present at this interview. Then he went out to call on our many Turkish Pashas who have gathered just at this time in Paris. This last month the Beloved met many of the most prominent men in both Turkish and Persian governments. The effect of which will be very great for the Cause. In the evening Mon and Madame Bernard visited the Master and he spoke to them in length on the life of St. Peter.

It was altogether a busy day for the Beloved. Our may write pages and say hardly anything.

Dear Harriet

This morning the mail brought a letter from Mrs. Ida Am Benjamin of San Francisco, now of London. It contained the sweet message of Hope. Love, Light and Unity. These are the inner symbols of the Baha’i life, the perfection of which we finds in the holy temple of Abdul Baha. As these four attributes and as they carry a general message to all the friends on the eve of our departure for the Easter lands, I will quote them herein for the benefit of all:

## Hope

>>You came to me in my early youth

In those dear old days gone by

When life was a joyous happy song,

And all was bright for you and I.<<

## Love

>>You came to me in later years.

To soothe my griefs and woes,

You came to wipe away my tears,

And exterminate all my foes.<<

## Light

>>You came as I am growing old.

A treasure within your hand,

One that I prize far more than gold,

Send to me by God's Command.<<

## Unity

>>And now the Master's voice heard,

Bidding all join with hand and heart,

Hope, Love, Light, each sacred word,

Must tho' united play its part.

Transmuted to a higher plane,

These blessings shall became

As Jacob's Ladder we ascend

And all shall be as one.<<

Today many believers came to see the Beloved. They were all sad because he is leaving Paris. To a number of them he said: With a pure heart and steadfast mind arise to spread the message of the Kingdom and speak with every one according to his capacity. Explain the divine subjects from the standpoint of the people. If the heart is pure and capacity exists, there is no doubt that the spiritual susceptibilities will play a tremendous influence.

{{p3}}

To another group he said: It is my hope that my heart be ever united with yours and the same spiritual susceptibilities that exist in my heart may be reflected in your hearts. May there be a great highway between my heart and your hearts! I have grown to love you very much and this love will be eternal. You are the new plant planted in the Paradise of Abha. You must be ever stirred by the Breeze of Providence, be watered by the rain of the divine guidance and be trained by the rays of the Sun of Reality. Turn always your faces toward the Kingdom of Abha. Be filled with Bahaullah.

{{p4}}

A Baha’i asked that she has read in some of the Holy writing that there were four degrees or pillars for the progress of the soul. What are these four degrees? The Master said: Bahaullah says! When the soul has travelled through many valleys it reaches to the city of Love. That city countries four pillars and whenever I find a hearing ear. I shall explain what these four pillar are. During the life of Bahaullah no one asked the explanation of this matter but now you ask and I will elucidate it for you. The first station is the station of Divinity; the Second is the station of Prophethood or manifestation; the third is the station of Sanctification and the fourth is the station of Servitude."

She said: "We must work real hard to read to the station of Servitude". It is evident, he said, the station of Servitude is very great.

"It is the brilliant crown of everlasting glory" she answered promptly and every one was pleased with her aptitude and inspiration.

{{p6}}

To another group he said: I have been in your midst for a few months. Only God knows how much I have grown to love you. Your love beats in my heart like the artery of life. During every stay, I have explained o you the divine Ideals. I have ignited in the chamber of your hearts the light of the Love of God. Strive day and night that its lustre and brightness may increase, so that the Light of God may <unreadable> all the regions the Kingdom of God may be established and the glory of Abha be revealed. Do not rest for one moment. Make ye a noble effort so that you may guide the souls; confer life upon these dead ones; make mindful those who are heedless, awaken those who are sleep, enkindle the extinct men and women with the consuming Fire of the Love of God and exhilarate the souls with the goblets of the wine of knowledge. I leave you here and I go to Egypt but I expect to revive good news from you that your meetings are glowing with the light of Faith and assurance.

Several other groups food a way to his Presence and with each he spoke sweetly and generously. Beside this bath in the morning and in the afternoon he found time to call on impotent princes and high personage from the East. In the evening his room was full with various nationality a very cosmopolitan gathering. Persian nobilities rubbed shoulders with Turkish Pashas and Simple Jewish Baha’is shook hand with the educated ladies of America.

His graceful power and divine courtesy hovered over all these people. The barriers castes were broken in his Presence and at least for those few heavenly moments they looked into each others faces with the shining light of brotherhood.

Thus our last day in Paris was spent with joy and fragrance, hoping and praying for the day when all mankind will be untimed with the high ideals of the Baha’i life. I close finish this with the words of the Beloved on hope.


I desire for you the station of Hope. Be ye ever hopeful in the Favors of god! Have ye no fear! Hope is the Cause of life.

Love to all

Ahmad





###Room No. 26. June 12th 1913

{{p1}}

Dear Harriet!

We were up this morning with the sole idea of departure ringing in our ears. My heart was singing the glad song, because I was going in the service of the King of Kings. How different would I have felt if I was going to the Orient all alone. There would not have been this enthusiasm, this wonder and this all absorbing interest! I think I can never thank enough the Beloved throughout all the worlds for hid heavenly Bounties! I have done less than nothing!

Before five, I was up, putting my last things in the satchel and about six some of the Persian friends and Mon. and Madame Dreyfus came in. We were all in his room drinking the last cup of tea in Paris in his Presence. He was likewise busy with the handbags of his papers and before long they were also ready. About 7:30 the hotel account was duly attended to and the large Omnibus arrived to take us to Le Gare de Lyous. At eight we were all in the Omnibus except the Master who was going with Mon and Madame Dreyfus in their auto. We arrived at the station at about 5 and found the Master in the centre of a large group of believers who had come to say goodbye. Soon the number increased and there were nearly 50 friends. The Master shook hands, had word or two for each and then went to his compartment and invited a number of the believers to go in and speak with him. He sent some very nice roses for Mrs. Sanderson and Madame Jackson. It was so touching that in the midst of all the hurry of the journey he should remember them and send them lovely message of {{p2}} consolation. By certain arrangement it was so decided that I should go with the Master on the train leaving 9:15 and the rest of our party may come with the train of 11:40; so I had a room just next to him. At the appointed time the train pulled out of the station and the last scene was the anxious upturned faces looking toward the Beloved and the waving hands and {{p3}} handkerchiefs. He was delighted with the beautiful country of green mountains and valleys, constantly changing and shifting, bringing before his vision most charming panoramas of nature. He said laughingly at present you and I are into his train. We will see what is going to happen. There he engaged himself in reading some Oriental letters and Arabic newspapers at twelve I served him with the lunch which was prepared by Sayad Assadallah and he asked me to eat with him, About 3 I prepared tea and for my services he gave me a bunch of grapes. He got acquainted with a young French and in my absence he carried long with him an interesting conversation inviting him to come to Haifa. He found also another friend who spoke Turkish and with him of course he was more at home.

{{p4}}

We entered Marseilles at 10:45 pm and was taken to Gare Saintcharles hotel which is joined to the station. At first we engageed two rooms but when we went up the Master observed that each room contained two large beds. As his room no. 26 was quite large, he insisted that I should give up mine and sleep in the same room with him. Goodness! I was scared to death! To sleep in the same room, under the selfsame roof with the Beloved had never, never entered my mind! What? Is this real? I struggled in vain to bring up some pretends and excuses. He would have none of them. At last, before his repeated command, I found myself like a somnambulist bringing next things into his holy room. I was trembling with fear. Then I waited till he went to bed and afterward, slowly I crept into mine. 

{{p5}}

Long my eyes were open and my mind busy thinking over this great privilege sleeping in the same room with the Beloved of the world! I could not believe in my own sense. In that hour, my American friends were remembered and slowly, slowly, I came out of my bed and crawled toward his. I prayed from the very depth of my heart for their assistance and confirmation. I prayed as I have never prayed before! I wept and kissed the hem of his garment! In that dark night there was no one else except God and my soul, yet I thought a throng of pure angels were hovering over my head.

{{p6}}

When I finished my prayer I returned again to my bed and fell into sleep. A me thought I heard a sweet voice, whose every note was perfect words of a poem which I was reading today as the train flew across plain and meadow trooped along in my memory, refreshing my sleep. These I will now shone them with you because they are dream ideals ere I leave Europe for the East. Met trampled in my dream I was addressing a vast concourse of humanity. 

>>"There is a Height higher than mortal thought;

There is a Love deeper than mortal love;

There is a Life which, taking not its hues

From Earth on earthly things, grows white and pure

And higher than the pithy cares of men,

And is a blessed life and glorified.

O, fair young souls I strain upward, upward still,

Even to the heavenly source of Purity!

Brave hearts! hear on and suffer! Strike for night!

Strong arms! hew done wrong! The world had need

O all of you - the sensual, wrongful world!

Hath need of you, and of thee too, fair Love.

Oh, Lovers, cling together! The old world is full of Hate. Sweeten it, draw in one

Two separate chords of Life; and from the bond

Of twin souls last in Harmony create a fair angel dwelling with you

Lord, the Lord of all!

Waft yourselves, yearning souls, upon the stars;

Sow yourselves on the wandering winds of space;

Watch patient all your days, if your Eyes take

Some dim, warm ray of knowledge
.
The dull world hath need of you the purblind, slothful world!

Live on, brave lives, chained to the narrow round

Of Duty; live, expand yourselves and make

The Orb of Being wheel on steadfastly

Upon its path the Lord of Life alone knows to what Goal of Good; Work on! Live on!"<<

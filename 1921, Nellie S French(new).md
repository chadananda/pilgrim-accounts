### May 1, 1921

On the morning of May first 1921. I sat in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in his own room in the little house adjoining the Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí. Our Lord sat upon the divan near the window, Monever <u>Kh</u>ánum and I on chairs before Him.  

He asked me if there was anything special which I wished to mention, and knowing that He understood that in my heart I was troubled, I mentioned that I had been very anxious over the continues practice of “Number Reading” and things of that character which was sometimes indulged in, even at the time of the regular meeting hour by the friends in America.  

Monever <u>Kh</u>ánum before interpreting this to our Lord commented upon it, and said that explicit directions had been given for the conduct of the meetings and the Feasts and she was surprised that they were not followed absolutely. She then turned to our Lord and told him what I had said.  

He replied:
 
“Ask them where, in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh they find these things”  

As He said this, his face wore that wonderful smile which showed me immediately that we must be all kindness in handling the matter but that it must be absolutely final, just as final of that in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh this things should not be found at all in any place.

> (I also told Monever <u>Kh</u>ánum that in one Assembly I knew it to be a fact, that dancing was indulged in before and after the meetings, which I felt was a very serious matter and jeopardized the reputation of the Bahá’í Cause. Monever was shocked beyond expression, and saddened by this information. I do not know whether she ever referred this to the Master or not, we were alone at the time it was mentioned.)

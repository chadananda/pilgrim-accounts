### Fridays November 23:

While visiting the Holy shrines at sunset, the Guardian evoke thus: “More teen half a million square meters (a third of a million meters in Haifa are a third in the city of ‘Akká) are in possession of the Cause, and the government has exempted all this property from taxation. The purchasing began at the time of His Holiness, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá but was limited. In spite of the great increase in area, even now the Israel government has not taxed the property & neither has the municipality. Therefore, we do not pay a cent. The NSA and LSA in Japan must endeavor to get the endowed properties exempt from taxation. According to the ten-year plan, the friends must establish 49 Hasirat’ul’quds. At present, 46 have been founded. There must be three more, one of which must, by all means, be in Venezuela. Also one in Stockholm (and according to Dr. Giachery in Rome, the third is to be in Lisbon.) All this will testify to the endeavors of the believers.   

According to the 10-year plan, 11 Mashriqu’l’Adhkars must be built, ten of which have already been scheduled and there must be one in. Sweden. The world is upset, but the Cause is at rest (The affairs of the Cause are orderly.) The Mishriqu’l-Adhkers for spiritual affairs and the Hasirat’ul’quds for administrative affairs are complements of each other.  

### November 27:

(On eve of the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, at about 10 O’clock while the Guardian was walking, towards the shrines, he said, “You are visiting on behalf of the Persians, the Japanese and the American friends. During the Master’s time, one of the maid-servants of God (Agnes Alexander) vent to Japan for spreading the teaching. The result is seen now”. After returning from the Holy Shrines the Guardian came to the Oriental pilgrims’ house and spoke about the prophecies of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Among other things, he said, “The Cause is progressing in Japan now. Very soon it must go to China and. Russia. The people in Japan and Germany are very receptive now, because for some time they have been afflicted with the revolution. His Holiness, Bahá’u’lla said, “My calamity is providence; outwardly it is fire I’d vengeance, but inwardly it is light, A mercy.” Also He said, “An unforeseen calamity is following you,” and in another place He said, “There shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake.” Both expressions mean the same: Greatest calamity, greatest justice, and then the greatest peace.   

“The number countries blessed by the Cause now totals 250: the number of centers is 4000, the number of Spiritual Assemblies is 1000, and the number of islands reached more than 100. On the Pacific Islands and among the yellow race, the progress of the Cause is very great, like that of the time of the Báb. Such progress has not been seen before in the history of the Cause. Before the beginning of the 10-year plan, the. Cause had reached only 30 islands, but after starting the crusade 70 more islands have been added. There are 1500 centers in America. In Latin America, more than 150 centers. In England the number has reached 100. In Germany, the centers have exceeded 150. In Írán there are only 900 centers at present, but this number must be increased to 1000. In India there are more than 150. The friends in Australia have established more than 100 centers. In Africa alone, centers no total more than 1000.”  

After a description of the Ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the chanting of a prayer at about one o’clock in the morning, when the time came to go to the Shrine, the Guardian, while walking, said, “Some of the articles of the Will and Testament must be printed in Japanese. The tablets of the Will and Testament are steps in the development of the Bahá’í use.  

### Wednesday, Nov. 28th:

On the grounds around the shrines the Guardian said: “Centers must be increased by All means: individual centers are preliminary to Spiritual Centers; spiritual center are preliminary to National Assemblies. The arising, of the friends in service according to the blessed Will and Testament must be a loving arising; it must be general and serious. After arising in service, they must spread far and wide in different localities like the Disciples of Christ. They must endeavor to develop the Centers into Local Assemblies. This depends upon the degree service and the steadfastness of the friends. Then soon the Local Assemblies will evolve into National ones. During next year, 13 National Assemblies will be added to the 12 existing ones, and must, according to the 19-year plan, total 60: t Three assemblies in Europe, one in Scandinavia, Finland and Denmark; one in Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg, and the third in Spain and Portugal. Five Assemblies in America: two in Central America, two in South America and one in Alaska. One Assembly in Japan. One in Indonesia and one in Pakistan. One assembly in Arabia, with the efforts of the Persian friends in Bahrain; the first center in that region with Faizi, the founder. The Thirteenth Assembly is to be in New Zealand.   

The Persian friends must influence the Japanese friends to rise in spreading the Cause. The Persian friends must rise and go to places where no one has gone before. Naturally, in the beginning it is very hard, but little by little it becomes easier. Miss Alexander went to Japan during the lifetime of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and was the only one; see the difference now. The friends must pay attention to the promises of the Blessed Perfection.   

### Thursday, November 29:

“In all countries there must be archives; National and Local. National archives must be in the capital and local ones in towns and villages. One section of the Ḥaẓíra must be specified for Archives.   

“The Cause has become widespread and my responsibilities are increasing. The world too, is upset. The Blessed Perfection has said that “after a while the governments of the earth will all change and persecutions will dominate.” The evidences have already been manifested. Then Bahá’u’lláh makes mention of revolution and says that Wafter revolution the sun of justice will rise from the hidden, horizon.” By the “Sun of Justice” is meant the most great justice. The persecutions will bring, about the Most Great Justice of God. Bahá’u’lláh also says, “The world’s equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most frost, this new World Order.” Notice there are two orders; the first is the order of the world. The second is the New Order, friends must be confident and strive to establish the New Order. The 10-year plan is for this very purpose. This plan consists of spreading organizing, strengthening, and beautifying. Conquering the continents and the island; is to spread the Cause of the Blessed Perfection. Then administering and strengthening the affairs pertaining to the Cause, i.e., establishing Ḥaẓírat’ul’Quds, founding endowments, enlarging the scope of publications, and forming assemblies is for strengthening the New Order. After this comes the beautifying, such as the building of the Holy Shrines of the Bah and their surroundings, which are silent teachers to all observers. They consist of establishments and enlargement of the Holy places and their beautifying. It must be like this in other countries also.  

The more severe the revolution the greater the conquest. The blessed Beauty was imprisoned, but God willed and the place of the Shrine of His Holiness, the Báb, was established. In the midst of the antagonism of the Covenant breakers, His Holiness, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá placed the body of the He on Mount Carmel. At the very time of greatest interference on the part of the Turkish Government inspector, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá started the construction of the Holy Shrines. During the conflict between the Arabs and Jew the Holy Shrines were built.  

### Friday Nov. 20:

“The land for ten Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kárs has been bought. Now the friends must work for their construction. In Írán the building of the temple has been postponed. In compensation, two more temples must be built which will make these in all. I hate given instructions to Mr. Charles Mason Reney to choose the plans for the tempi in Africa. The one in Australia, which according to the Will of the Master is to be built in Sidney, I mean to have built soonest. The land has been purchased. Endeavoring to obtain land for temples, Risings and endowments are all tasks for the Crusade. In Latin America, also, the localities are chosen; one in Panama and one in Chile. Today, I received the gland tidings that one of the Argentinian friends has donated the land for the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár. Therefore, the property for two temples is at hand; one in Argentina and the other in Chile. In Canada also the land has been set aside. In Cairo, too, the land has been purchased by the river of the Nile. The temple property in Ba<u>gh</u>dád is on the shore of the River Tigris, and is land blessed by Bahá’u’lláh’s passing over it. In the capital of India, also the temple property has been bought. Property for three temples have been set aside in Africa, one in the north (Cairo); one in the center (Kampala, Uganda), in the very heart of the continent, the one chosen to be the mother temple of Africa; and the third in the south, in. Johannesburg."   

“In America, three temples properties are in hand; one in Canada, one in Penang and one in Chile.   

“In Asia two temples, one in India and one in Ba<u>gh</u>dád. In Europe three, one in the north Stockholm of (which the land has not yet been bought); one in Frankfurt, the heart of Eutrope, chosen be the mother temple of Europe; and one in Rome for Southern Europe. In the Kitábi-Aqdas mention is made of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár. In the Holy Land the spacious property purchased on the summit Of Mount Carmel is for the Temple. The Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár is for worship, the Shrines are for visitation, ant the Administrative Centers (Ḥaẓíras) are for service. Now the friends must prepare to help built the Temple in the Holy Land."  

The construction of the Shrines is two parts; the inside compartments are like unto pearls and outlier parts are the shells used for the protection of the pearls. This shell is both for protection and for beauty. The inner compartments are left as they were, The Holy plows in Bahjí & ‘Akká are not yet illuminated with electricity; they still have the same old-fashioned oil lamps. They are kept in the original fashion because in that way they are more impressive. In Persia, too, the Holy places must remain in the original fashion, especially the BEIT (House) in <u>Sh</u>íráz which is a place of pilgrimage. Most of the Holy Places in Írán have been bought. Endeavor must be made to have the rest purchased as well and around the Holy places there must be gardens and parks especially in Chihriq and Mahku, and the blessed place of Martyrdom in Tabriz. Efforts must be made for the purchase of those in Chihriq and Mahku, but the place of the Martyrdom of the Báb’s still hard to obtain.   

### Saturday, December l:

“America more than Europe, Europe more than Asia, and Asia more than Africa: All are alarmed and dismayed. Those who are more bound with materialism are more frightened Moderation is best in everything, Excessive patriotism leads to prejudice. His Holiness, Bahá’u’lláh says, “Verily, erelong cities shall burn in its flame.” (the flame of prejudice.) The friends are promulgating the New Order, The New order is the child of the covenant of the Blessed Perfection, and is the introduction to the establishment of the Divine Civilization and Divine Kingdom, which shall soon come into existence. The world revelation will give place first to the Lesser Peace end then to the Most Great Peace, the beginning of which was the Year Sixty (1844). First, there was the Declaration of His Holiness, the Báb: then came the Year Nine, B.E. (1855); then came the Declaration of the Gauss in Ba<u>gh</u>dád; then followed the Announcement of the Cause to the Sovereigns and the Clergy in Adrianople; then came the founding of the Covenant; and now we have the New Order which is the Child of the Covenant of the Blessed Perfection. After the establiahment of the New Order well come the Lesser Peace, which is the forerunner of the Most Great Peace. After that will come the Divine Civilization. This Divine Civilization will rise in future generations as the result of the Most Great ace. In this Dispensation the New Order is established. The present phenomena are• the intr•ductb to the New Order. The Unity of Mankind will not be proclaimed until the Lesser Peace is established. The Unity of Nations will be the result of the Divine Civilization. The principle of unity leads to the Divine Civilization Now is the period of discord, a time of contention and warfare, a time of purification. This strife and warfare will purify and unite. They will purify the hearts and unite the nations. That is why the friends must not be upset. They must have the assurance of the hart. They must know as clear as day light that all this is the fulfillment of the promises of God.”   

### Sunday, December 2:

“Today I was occupied in assigning the number of representatives of the 13 Spiritual Conventions of America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. Last year 5 NSA’s were formed in Africa. Now in the four other continents they must establish NSA’s. More than 300 representatives will take part in the 15 Conventions in electing the 13 National Assemblies. The representatives will be elected from places where Local Spiritual Assemblies are established; e.g.; the number of representatives in Japan and surrounding islands, such as Korea, will be 19, because the number of Local Assemblies total more than 9. Also in Southeast Asia and in Pakistan. Now there are 20 Local Assemblies in Pakistan. Hence, 5 representatives will be elected in Pakistan because the number of Local Assemblies has exceeded 19. In New Zealand the representatives will not be more than 9 because it is the beginning of the week there. Also in Arabia."  

On the continent of Europe, three NSA’s will be established. For the election of these three Assemblies, three Conventions will meet. The number of representatives in these conventions will vary. In some it is 10 while in others 9 or 38.   

“In South & Central America more than 50 Local Spiritual Assemblies will take part. The number of representatives is 38 (2 x 19). In South America 76 representatives will take part to elect two National Spiritual Assemblies. Each Convention has 58 representatives. The total number of representatives in South and Central America is 152 (2 x 76). The total number of representatives in the Conventions of the four continents, America, Europe, and Asia as Australia exceeds 500. I will give the glad tidings at the time of Riḍván; you may tell the friends orally now.”   

“The NSA’s will be elected by the electors, men and women. The limper varies according to the number of believers. This is the principle of the New Order.  

It is not by preference. It is general and free.  

“The election of the representatives of the Universal House of Justice is of the third degree-form; NSA’s: second degree form, and Las first degree form, the last elected directly by the people from among 9 or more. The NSA’s are elected by representatives of the communities. The MIAs will then elect the representatives of the Universal Howell of Justice. This is according to the instructions in the book of the Will & Testament, wherein is mentioned the special House of Justice, which are these very NSA fee are now in the third stage of the IQ-yr Plan of the Great Crusade. In the first stage, about 100 countries and islands were conquered. In the second year of the Plan, the friends entered the second stage of the Crusade. In this second stage the friends started to establish Ḥaẓíras, endowments, the buying of Temple grounds and the Increasing of the centers and forming assemblies use goals were the second stages of the Crusade and lasted two years. In the third stake, friends must centralize their efforts in forming NSA’s. The first duty of the crusaders in the third stage is increasing the NSAs. The first duty of the Crusaders in the third stage is increasing the NSA’s. In the second year (third stage), the establishment of 13 NSAs, and also the initiation of the founding of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kárs. This great Crusade is in stages. It is for the establishment o Na and also the founding of Temples. More than $600,000 has been expended for the purchases of Ḥaẓíras, and 100,000 for endowment together about 5/4 of a million dollars. Of the • 49 Ḥaẓíras, 46 have been bout, and 3 are still to be purchased. And of the 50 endowment which are to be bought only 7 countries remain in which they have not as yet been purchased. The friends must now concentrate their efforts on the founding of the Temples  on subscription to funds for their construction. (Endowments, Ḥaẓíras & Temples) The Land for ten Temple has been bought for more than $100,000.  

His Holiness, the Báb, says “Leave your cities to help the Cause of God.” This is the clear command of the Báb. It is a Spiritual crusade, not political. It is for the arousing to life of the people, not for killing them. The obvious promise of the Blessed Perfection in regard to pioneering is The Holy Spirit will help and assist those who leave their homes:” Also, is the most earnest exhortation in the Will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who said, that after Him they should follow the example of the Disciples of Christ. The command of the Báb. Promise of Bahá’u’lláh and the Will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Now is the time of fulfillment. The establishment of the Cause deve1oping the Administrative Order, and spreading out these together are fulfillment.   

“The number of colored believers in some localities exceeds 500. In the Pacific Ocean, the brown race has localities with more than 500 believers. The adherents among the yellow race of china and Japan and the red-skinned race of America are ever increasing.   

“After the conflict between the Arabs and the Jews, I encouraged the friends to buy the land about the Holy Shrine; otherwise, today it weld have been impossible to do so. The Holy Shrine would have been surrounded by the dwelling-places of the Jews. The friends took advantage of the opportunity. The head and the heart of Mount Carmel are in possession of the friends and the tail is in the hands of the Jews.   

### Monday, December 5:

“In Venezuela there is sane Spiritual Assembly in the capital and only four isolated centers, but in Brazil there are 3 Assemblies & 11 centers; that is pioneering in Venezuela is preferred to pioneering in Brazil. In Latin America, there are 20 republics, but the number of Assemblies & centers is few. The friends must spread out and go to places where there we no Bahá’ís, Those coming from outside too, must start new centers. When you travel to South America you must not live in the capitals. None have entered towns and villages yet; that is individual centers must develop more in Persia also, the development of individual centers must be emphasized by Mr. Furútan, and members of the Spiritual Assemblies. Living in 8apitals is dangerous. The world is upset. And people to travel to Europe must prefer villages to towns because they fare more peaceful. The friends in Írán must endeavor to increase the centers and brine them up to 1000 or more. They must strive to get into Af<u>gh</u>ánistán by way of Korassan which is near it Af<u>gh</u>ánistán has preference but it is necessary to pioneer in Af<u>gh</u>ánistán & Baluchistan.”   

I asked, if in future calamities the friends in Írán would be safe. The Guardian benevolently answered, “It is my hop that they may be safe, but they must leave the Capital.” Then he continued, “In the last ten years the land on Mt. Carmel has been purchased and endowed to the Holy Shrines. A part of this property was turned over to and registered in the name of branches of the NSA’s branches of the NSA of America, England, Canada, Australia and Írán. The land above the Shrine is registered in the name of the branch of the NM of Írán, although the Assembly itself is not acknowledge by the Government of Írán as yet, but its branch is registered here.$18,000 was paid for this property. Henceforth, little by little, endowments will be made in the name of other branches of other Assemblies. All will be joint land-owners in the Holy Land. This is the beginning of endowments in the Holy Land. More than 180 Assemblies are formally registered in the Bahá’í world. Of this number, 80 are in one country, the USA. In Írán & Iraw none is registered yet. Ten NSAs and 140 Las are registered. In Írán, too, the NSAs and the LSAs spat be registered. The registration of the Assemblies is for the endowments. Local endowments in the name of local Assemblies, & national endowments in the name of NSA: will be registered. Afterwards, in the Holy Land, endowments will be registered in the name of the Universal House of Justice. The land owned around the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh (Haram’i’Aqdas) is also registered. The premises about the Shrine of the Báb are called Haram’i’Ashraf. All this is the effect of the Tablet of Carmel. In America, Bahá’í endowments have exceeded $3,000,000, and all are registered in the name of the NSA Temples, Ḥaẓíras & schools are all in the name of organizations & not individuals. Here we do not pay a cent of taxes, although the government has taxed other endowments, even those of the Jews. This privilege is granted only to the Bahá’ís.   

“Friends must travel for pioneering. They must start new centers, from assemblies. Registration comes after formation, and transferring after registration endowments are transferred to the name of the Assemblies. The principles of the Bahá’ís endowment is powerful indestructible.  

### Tuesday, December 4:

“The Tablet of Carmel was written on the premises of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár lot (on the Mount). The tent of the Blessed Perfection was pitched on this lot which was blessed by His steps. In the future, the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár on Mt. Carmel and that in Írán will be constructed. When the time comes it will be made possible.” Then the Beloved Guardian spoke about a new pilgrim, Mr. Bill Carr, who had arrived the day before, and said “This person is a pioneer in Greenland. He is a Canadian. The future of the Dominion of Canada is very great, and the events connected with it infinitely glorious.” “His Holiness, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, said these very words,”. Greenland is situated 78 degrees above the Equator. The good news of the opening of the Franklin Island, 75 degrees above the Equator, was formerly given. The pioneering locality of this person is 7 degrees above. In Europe pioneering has extended as tar north in Norway as 75 degrees. I am now encouraging friends to go to Spitsbergen which is 80 degrees north (10 degrees below the North Pole.)   

The Beloved Guardian also quoted these votes of the Blessed Perfection: “In the western and northern regions people will arise!” meaning the time has now come for this to be realized.  

At the tine of the writing of the Kitáb’i’Aqdas, not even 15 localities had been opens ( and the Faith had not reached the northern regions. It was only in the temperate region. Now, the meaning of the phrase, “Worship must be performed by the clock & not by the sun” is made evident.   

“Friends have sent Bahá’í books and literature to centers as far north as 80 degrees. Doctor Esselment’s book war translated into Danish e sent to 45 centers in Greeland Island (above the Arctic Circle). Give this new to the friends in South America and Írán. Greenland is mentioned in the Tablet of the Master. In regard to the Eskimos, He says, “These people must be guided; both they & the American, Indent, the Pre in the minority as a result of the friends’ pioneering, a few of them have accepted the Cause. The circle of the Cause has been extended from the northernmost regions to the southernmost in the republic of Chile (Magallenas). A chain (range) of Bahá’í centers is established from the north (Greenland) to the Southern region of Chile. 1500 center in the USA, 100 centers in Canada, and 130 centers in Latin America. In Russia and Asia beyond the same lotituitanal regions must be established.  

“American, Persian and German friends whose regions are adjacent to the Russian Republic should attempt this. Alaska from the north, Persia from the south, and Germany from the west should later enter the republic. The Russian Republic has 18 divisions, the names of which are recorded in the 10-year plan. In five of these friends are already living. Recently, one pioneer went to Tibet.  

“There are four countries which are subjects of the Russian Republic Romania is a virgin territory. No one has yet set foot init. One pioneer is at present in Serbia. There are a few believers in Bulgaria; also in Albania. Friends must go pioneering in these regions. The Americans - Germans are translating the Bahá’í Teachings into Russian. With the hope of their being circulated by the pioneers. In Persia, also, Bahá’í literature must be translated into the Russian language. Emphasize this when writing to Mr. Furútan. Numerous Bahá’í works have been translated into more than 210 languages. Before the great 8rusade, translations of the works into other language had reached 88 in 100 yrs. Now, according to the Plan, in 3 yrs translations have beer made into more than 70 languages. According to the Plan, it must reach. 90 languages in 10 yrs. But already translations have been made into more than 50 languages which as not Included in the Plan. In these years, translating has been done, altogether, into 120 languages.   

It has been said over and over again that if one-tenth of the Bahá’í of Ṭihrán, should leave that capital, the Blessed Cause will soon encompass the world. If they would leave Ṭihrán & New York e spread out, they would be much safer.   

This does not refer to cities whose Babel population is small. The Blessed Perfection has plainly said, “Cities will burn”. The first sign was seen in the last war. Has warnings came into ‘reality. It must be emphasized that the friends should go from town to villages. They are safer themselves and the result is better for the Cause because the people have greater capacity in smaller places and are more receptive. The call of the Cause is widespread but not yet worldwide. The principle of the Teachings is re yet deep-rooted in the newly opened territories. When the pioneers arrive they must take care that the new order be well founded. Increasing h. strengthening the centers are both needed. Pioneering and earnest effort must parallel. It vial in that case be satisfactory e glorious. It must be impressed upon the friends, especially the pioneers, that the principle object in pioneering is striving and endeavoring; that is to say, teaching; Pioneering is for teaching and not for business. The friends must not mix in political & governmental affairs, so that they may be protected. The well-being of the pioneers is in service to the Cause 4 keeping away from politics. Otherwise, they will be berefit of the help of God & the final result will be regret & repentance.  

### Wednesday, December 5:

At 3:00 P.M. at the time of saying farewell to the Beloved Guardian of the World he spoke thus: “The Iranian friends should endeavor to conquer towns in South America, but should never mix in politics, so that they may remain unharmed. Who so obeys the blessed Perfection shall benefit by God’s help & assistance. If friends do not endeavor in the matter of pioneering, assistance will be withdrawn from them. Friends must especially scatter about. I do not mean that they should fo.5’allit each other, but they must start new centers.”   

The Guardian then gave me a piece of a curtain formerly used in the Shrine of the Báb, to take us a present for the Ḥaẓírat’ul’-Quds of Caracas (when purchased). Tie said that he had sent one to the Ḥaẓírat’ul’Qud’s of Brazil, also.   

“The friends must now try for the foundation o the Mashraq’ul’Adhkar there (in Brazil both Ḥaẓírat’ul’Quds and Temple.  

He also said that the Cause was brought to Brazil in the Tin, of the Master by Leonora Holsapple (Arstrong). “Ommol-Moamenine Val Moamenate”)

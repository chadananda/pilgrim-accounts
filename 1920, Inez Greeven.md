### April 26,1920

In another morning the Master called me to his house and said “You are very welcome – you must not feel like guest in this house, you are my daughter and I am your father – it is like your own home –and I love you very much. I should be with you always in heart and soul and I should pray for you.when you return to America the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh will protect you alwaysand I praybthrough his aid you may render service to the Cause. Never let the material thing make you unhappy – do you think they are worthwhile? No, they are a mere passing receipt. A mother sometimes goes against her child, a husband r wife forgets  after a year’s separation, but love of God is eternal. He never forgets, he is always with you. You have a pure heart and spirit and it will guide you in the right way. See what a light station the Kings and Queens have had in the material world, and how it has all passed and is without result. All material things have the same ending but in the Kingdom of God the lovest have ___ ___.”  

### April 26,1920

In the morning I was called to the Master’s house and after shaking my hand he walked up and down for a few minutes and said: “How are you? Are you well?” Then He sat and designated a chair for me. The conversation was in substance as follow. You should be very happy that you have been favoured to come here and attain to this meeting. I am your friend, God is your friend always, never doubt it but think of this whenever you are sad try to review her what I am saying – “Never let the material things make you sad if you believed be, come and see me anytime when you go away, if you become sad return here and be refreshed. I am your father and I love you very much.” After a few moment of silence he said: “Would you like to go to Persia unite the party it is to be sent.” I answered that I would very much. He continued, “Then I shall write to America and tell them. You can return and continue your plans. The party will leave at the beginning of next spring. Have you anything you wish to say?” I said I had two lawsuits that need to be settled as I needed the alimony from my husband before I could go, and the Master said: “But he must be obliged to give it to you. I know all your troubles but they do not matter.” Then I said: “She only reason. I am sad is not because I am so unworthy and fid I cannot live up to this teachings.” He said: “I will pray for you that you may become enlightened and a Bahá’í indeed.” I asked why our faults became so clear here that my inner condition made me very sad. He said: “An atom cannot be seen but when you put it in the path of the sun it becomes visible and when a butterfly is drawn to the light through the power of love its beauties become manifest.” He gave me two ___ and two for Mrs. King, saying: “She loves you very much, Mrs. King loves you very much. Don’t think, be happy – not sad. Thank God that you have been accepted in the Kingdom.”  

### May 1st.

The Master said this morning that he sent for me and gave me these talks as lessons, and I must learn them and put them into action. That I had great capacity and he prayed for great results from me in the future – that I should be as a flame when I left here and so intense that he can’t feel the heat in Haifa. I should be as a flaming candle – no, as a star, as the moon and light the night. The people of America must say that I had changed completely from this visit, that I was greatly favoured to have so much of love. You are my dear daughter. I love you very much. Speak to me as your father and tell me if you have enough money to get home with comfortably whatever you need I will give you – always come to me when you are in need, but God will never provide for you. Do not be sad over material things. I said material things never made me sad, especially money, that God had provided me with the means for this trip and I had sufficient, but would been like to leave some for the poor. He said, “No, I give to them once a week and there are some private donations here besides a fund, so they do not need it. Give to the poor elsewhere as they are God’s trust to him and must be cared for. But take care of yourself right now, and do not spend your money so freely. I spoke of my inner condition being the cause of unhappiness now as I was so critical and could not help seem the faults of others. He said, I must not, that he had sent for me for that reason and continued: ‘I understand all and when so many are in the same house there will be friction – you must be the peace maker and when the conversation leads to war, you must change it to bring peace or leave. Follow my example, for I do not tell you of the short comings of others – nor do I mentions your faults to others, I am very merciful to you. Be you likewise. You must flame with love, have a good disposition so that all may love you and be made happy you have all been accepted as children of the kingdom, which is of God’s great bounty, so you must act accordingly now go back to the house and kiss, embrace.’ Then he laughed very much and gave me a rose he had in his girdle.”  

### May 5th.

The Master sent for me again this morning and after telling me to sit beside him, asked me how I was. When I said “better, much better.” He asked why. I said that and what had happened at the house, I spoke only of my own condition – as being chaotic and unhappy over being so critical. Then the Master said, “So be aware of one’s faults is a good condition and causes perfection, but to see the faults of others makes one decrease in perfections. Never sit with the birds on the lowerbranches, but fly to those on the high branches. Look at the creatures only as the handwork of God and their relations to Him, do not let them make you sad. For instance, look at me with all flame to bear – am I ever sad? Never I always meet you ___. I speak plainly to you as a father to his beloved child and for your progress but to the stranger and must be more careful. If one is sad when he enters a beautiful garden he cannot enjoy it nor tell one when he leaves of the beauty of the flowers and their perfume likewise you are sad you are here. You will not enjoy the Divine bounty of this garden – you are greatly blessed to have been permitted to come here.” After a pause: “Are you entirely free from your husband now and did he want the divorce?” When I explained and also said that I prayed for him that he might be awakened the Master said; “He will be, but he will be sad, even unhappy, and will not like with this woman long (he had asked of her – what type she was and if he’d wish to marry her). It is incomprehensible that he should have left you perhaps he never had very good qualities.” I said yes, that he has alright once but under a bad influence and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said through my pity God would help him and that he also would pray. He said: “God will send you another and better man who will protect and be good to you and make you happy. But select carefullyand think about it – a good heart and spirit and intelligence are necessary.”  

In the first part of his talk when I said it was so hard to be good, he said, “Yes, but it is good to be good. All things that are good are hard, as learning for example. It is good to be learned but difficult. Self is the hardest thing to understand. It will not always be hard – after a while it will be easy – trust what I say.”  

### May 7.

Very welcome, very welcome. I have seen all the others now I shall see you – and again before you go you re my good daughter. When you return I want you to be such a flame that the people will say it is entirely another Mrs. Cook. I see that you are quiet always – I want you to be strong like a lioness and talk, teach. Stand up at the meetings and read the word, then tell them of what you have learned here I have educated your spirit and I want you entirely enkindled, so that if all the calamities of the world should befall you, you would not care at all. Let them say that while before you were physical, now you are spiritual. Have courage for I shall pray for you constantly from the Kingdom of God. Man has been given great courage and with the help of God this develops. I want you to become so well from that I shall hear of your work here – from all over the world. Do you think you can do this? Will you guarantee that you will do this? If you will think of what I say it will aid you always – try to put it into practice. Actions will show your gratitude for God’s bounty to you. I love you very much and will help you. You will become so detached from the world that you will think and speaks only of God. You must be sure to go to Persia with the Party, but now prepare yourself. The Persians are our fire – very kind, very warm and very loving. They do not disagree (with a laugh and I remarked that if that were the case I should stay forever) If you care to remain you may – many have gone for a short time, but wanted to stay. You must talk to them, enflame then and learn to fly.

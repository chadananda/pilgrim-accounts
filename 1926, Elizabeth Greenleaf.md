### From Mrs. Elizabeth Greenleaf

### 1926

Mrs. Greenleaf asked Shoghi Effendi of the Bahá’í Cause was not a great spiritual democracy? He said: “Yes, in that the governing body is elected by a free and absolutely free ballot; that the delegates were elected by the people	and that in turn they elected the members of this body.” He said: “However, after the body is elected, it is supreme.” He used the word “supreme”. Then he said, “If there are any questions after the election, they should hold over in abeyance until the following year, but there must be absolute unity and loyalty to the body once elected. There, must be the utmost loving kindness. That unless, everyone’s heart was in the utmost loving state, we could not have the full expression of the Will of Bahá’u’lláh. That there was a unity existing that was not expressed.” “The test of loyalty is loyalty to the Assemblies.”

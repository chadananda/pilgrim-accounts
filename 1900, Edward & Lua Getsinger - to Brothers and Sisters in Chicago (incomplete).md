My dear brothers and sisters in Chicago - Greetings! -  

Once more, through the Mercy and Grace of God, my dear husband and myself have reached this blessed land, have been permitted to knell at the Holy feet of our revered Lord and Master, the beloved son of God, His greatest Branch and Mystery and our eyes have once more rested and feasted upon the Glory of his Face.

But, thank God, everything will be made clear, for the Truth is like light of the sun, nothing can hide it. Mrs. Kheiralla and Mírzá Asadu’lláh are, I hope, by this time in New York and they are well-prepared to give your hungry souls rich and delicious food. This teacher is

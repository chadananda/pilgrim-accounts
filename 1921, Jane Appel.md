We four left Cairo Sunday Evening – Arna, Mrs. Houser, Mr. Will Remey – amid the usual excitement of a hurried departure. Made the train and change at Kantara, found sleepers waiting, most comfortable, Excellent service – and a comfortable trip, nearing the Bay of Haifa about noon Monday and the town on time at one o’clock.  

Mrs. Houser and I were so excited with the realization that we had reached at last after over a month’s travel our destination that we were in a tremble all over. We lost the first view of the Bay but not of the friends. We all saw Mason Remey first and we were all so glad on account of Will’s pleasure in finding him. Then Fugeta, Arthur Redeen, A. Zizullah who took care of everything, bags and all. Brought us up in the car to the Pilgrim House.  

How simple, plan unusual, but such a welcome – such a feeling of having reached home at last.  

Mason, the boys, Fugeta and Arthur did everything for our comfort. We had luncheon and then a long rest. After which tea was served and we then drove out on the plain of Haifa. We saw the tomb of the Báb way up the mountain there and many other points of interest. The school of the prophets, The Monastery, The Convent where the nuns are waiting the second coming of Christ – the nearness of the Bible – the same surrounding – changed so little seems so real.  

We saw the wonderful coloring on the Bay with the red tiled roofs of the low houses.

Prayed that we ___ all be confirmed – said that we had come at a good time ____ the cold and before the heat. He asked about our journey ____ health comfort.

sig. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  

### 2/8/21

‘Abdu’l-Bahá – The Master sent or us after tea. We went and waited in the garden with Rúḥá Khanoum daughter of the Master. Their welcome end friendliness was 1ovely. Finally the Master called and Rúḥá Khanoum interpresed. The Master looked stronger than the night before. He was seated upon a small couch looking out of the window at his side from time to time as he talked. Arna showed him Patti’s pictures and he looked very happy. Then Arna asked how he could like us to return and the Master answered that he wished us to go to Paris and London and meet the Bahá’ís there. Then the Master said that it was good to travel in the cause of God and bring the message to new people. That service not in the cause of God was without avail. He spoke of Mr. Wilson, Napoleon, Bismark, and of the uselessness of the service to their countries, and then of their death all alone and deserted. The Master then told of Mary Magdalene and that while in Paris a beautiful Cathedral was built in her honor – she has lived because of her work in God’s cause. We spoke of Mrs. Houser’s going around the world and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wished that all success might be hers.  

We asked that we might be confirmed in God ‘s work and The Master said He prayed that we might, that God never left us, that the Holy Ghost would direct us in all we tried to teach. That we were like his army each a soldier sent out and that he never left us.  

The Master stood and shook hands with each of us and we left with Rúḥá Khonoum.   

### The Tomb of the Báb

Rube Khonoum took us for a drive up Mt. Carmel and to the tomb. We first went to the Main assembly room and waited, were served tea and fruit. Talked together mostly about the education of children. She is so unlike an Oriental woman – so progressive – so anxious that her children receive the best education and tut they should be free. Her little girls will never wear the veil.  

We then went to the Tomb. After removing one shoes and washing o hands with Nose water, we entered and stood facing the room of the tomb. Someone chanted a prayer after which we each knelt and prayed at the door. It was all so simple, quiet and peaceful. A wonderful calm spell hard beyond words to explain.   

We came out to ace the beautiful afterglow just fading on the sky over the blue, blue bay of Haifa.  

May Cod confirm us and make us steadfast in his cause.   

### 2/10/21

This is a wonderful wing morning. The air is full at warm sunshine. Everything is full of life.  

We were called to the Master and he greeted us with such radiant welcome saying, over and over, “Welcome, you are very welcome.” The Master then talked to us about health and disease saying that disease was always contagious but it was not so in regard to health. That the nature of man was always to reach out and seek the bad – that person life without training from the spiritual sources was always seeking tile bed and destroying the good. Often men were worse than animas. A wolf will destroy one ship while man will kill many of his own kind in one stroke.  

Arna asked about why spiritual person were ill. The Master answered that there were two kinds of disease, physical and spiritual and that the diseases caused infections were physical and attack the physical body according to natural laws. All physical life is subject to natural laws. That spiritual diseases were caused by shock, injury, sorrow, and greet exposure to hardship. Spiritual diseases were often due to mental fatigue. Consumption was a disease of a spiritual nature in this sense. The Master said that one might have a very terrible dream of such a nature that the mind would become affected and result in lose of mental faculties. This would be spiritual disease.  

The Master approved of work such as I have tried and said it was good not to mind what criticisms were made.   

### 2/11/21

This place of perfect peace. The Master called for us shout two o’clock. All the ladies, Mrs. Morton, Ven Patton, Perron Houser and myself. Arna asked about sending children to Sunday School and the Master said it would be much better to send them to a Bahá’í Sunday School as the Christians do not teach Christ in the true spirit of rather in reality.  

The Master then talked about the Bahá’í cause in its relations to all other religions, Christian, Jew, all and that the Bahá’í teaching were inclusive. They contained the principles or each religion not only did a Christian or a Jew understand his own religion better but embraced the other prophets. There (?) also found not only interest but the solutions of their questions in the Cause. Each individual could find the things in which he was most interested. The economist found laws if one wanted freedom it was there.  

The Master then told the story of the Jew who was tried in a court in Persia because he became a Bahá’í and he said he was not guilt because he still believed in his own religion and at the same he believed in Christ and the Bible and also Muḥammad and the Qur’án and though he were put to death he would not deny Christ. They tried to frighten him but he remained firm. And at last (?)  

### 2/12/21

We left by train early for ‘Akká. It was a beautiful day. The sun over the sea and land was bright and clear. We entered old prison city through the main gate and walked through the Gate to the barracks. The English are now cleaning and remodelling putting in (?)  

We walked up the long dark hill, climbed the stone steps by the passage of many feet to the rooms above where the holy Family were imprisoned. The room where Bahá’u’lláh wrote the tablet to the kings and where the son of Bahá’u’lláh was killed. From there we went to the first house where Bahá’u’lláh was kept for seven years and then through to the second room where there were some of his belongings. He was sunlight and air. The room faced the sea and there was a balcony on three sides. For two years Bahá’u’lláh occupied these rooms and was in comfort for the only time during his imprisonment.  

We then went through the Bazaars and by carriage to Bahjí and visited the tomb no words can describe the feeling caused by the wonderful presence.  

The beauty - simplicity - fragrance - the majesty. Leaving the tomb we had luncheon and then drove to the garden of Riḍván. Home by carriage along the Beach in the late afternoon.  

In the early evening we were called to the Master and he asked us if we had enjoyed our visit if we were happy – he spoke only a little but made us very happy.  

He said it was not the length of time we staid but our meeting, that many came and staid only a day and went away and great results followed the meetings. Also if we carried out the laws of Bahá’u’lláh we would never be separated.   

### Sunday 2/13/21

We spent a quiet day most of it with Rúḥá at her home. After having been shown the pictures of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh by the Greatest Holy Leaf, These treasures are wonderful. A little of the intense feeling one has at the tomb is felt as one studies the picture of Bahá’u’lláh. The wonderful face is so intense and so fine. Eyes are so clear and piercing.  

The Great Holy Leaf also had a wonderful picture of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in colors. Seemed as if it was done only yesterday, the likeness was so perfect. The dear little woman showed ‘us many treasures and among them was the hair, of Bahá’u’lláh which she had cared for herself. It was black and still full of life.  

We remained out in the sunshine taking pictures until lunch time. Tea the late afternoon. We drove up to the tomb of the Báb. We sat out in the balcony of the keepers house and enjoyed the wonderful view, We talked together and with some of the other Pilgrims and then one at a time went into the tomb.  

After we came home, the Master sent for us and we had a Short talk. We were made happier that at any other time. The Master said that we were welcome because we came to him in spirit and our meeting was one of the spirit. That many came and there was only a physical Meeting, but with us we were welcome because of the spiritual meeting.   

### Monday 2/14/21

It has rained very hard all morning we have read and mended – rested until Rúḥá Khanoum came and took us to the Master. The Master was in his own room for the first time. His face was very beautiful and expressive.  

He spoke to us of the life and sacrifice of Christ: of his death and of his goodness and gentleness, of the forgiving Christ. Truly no one can make Christ allying personality save ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. His teachings to us have been filled with the love of Christ. The Master brought out the point of the unreasonableness of the teaching that all people before the birth of Christ sacrifice save all.   

### Tuesday 2/15/21

We saw the Master with Mrs. Van Patten and Mrs. Morton during the early afternoon and the Master spoke of how short a time we had been here, but that time was so small a factor that many people come for only a d-ay and great results occurred great benefits to humanity that others came for a long period and without results.  

The Master then spoke of the strength and love would come to us if we made every effort to teach. Tea the afternoon we were called to talk about Mrs. True’s cable and the conversation.  

### 2/18/21

The Master called us during the morning. He was so happy and made us so happy. He said we were all good Bahá’í. the (?) bounty was without limit full and free.

### 1953

Milwaukee’s Bahá’í leader, Lawrence A Hautz, returned Monday from a flight around the world, “absolutely convinced” that only a religion of world brotherhood can save the earth from atomic destruction. Hautz’s mission was to help plant the new Bahá’í Faith in every country. He met in New Delhi, India, with 500 Bahá’s from 35 countries. “We were completely in arrangement on the religious, racial and political principles which otherwise divide people,” he said. “I found that this idea is a reality — not just pie in the sky.”  

“Here were people as diversified in nature as is possible to imagine, yet completely transformed, relived of religious, racial, political, economic or sex prejudice, as a result of the unifying force of the teachings of nBahá’u’lláh.” The prophet of the Bahá’í Faith.  

### Went to Russian Embassy

Hautz, who is known for this outspoken nature and crusading zeal, had the time of his life on this trip.  

He marched into the Russian embassy in New Delhi and snapped. “You people think religion is the opiate of the masses, but you’re dead wrong.” He sat down and gave members of the staff a lecture on the Bahá’í faith and told them religion had come a long way from the corrupt form it assumed in czarist Russia. He said they listened politely and told him when he left: “You’re not such a bad guy.”  

He got an appointment with the top Buddhist priest in India. “What are you going to do about your corrupt priests?” he demanded. He detailed stories of corruption from his own observation, and the priest acknowledged that the time for reform seemed to be not too far off.  

### Has Praise for Nehru

In an interview with India’s Prime Minister Nehru, Hautz demanded to know: “What is the difference between a prophet of God and a politician like you?”  

Nehru told him politicians must comprise in order to accomplish anything, while religious prophets never deviate from their principles. This impressed Hautz, and they had a 20 minute talk on just what compromises were necessary to guide a superstitious old country like India in the Complex world today.  

“Nehru is in my opinion a man of destiny for India, and will never be a tool of Moscow,” Hautz said. “He is a rare combination of sincerity, high principle and complete devotion to his country and its objectives.”  

### Hautz Is Insurance Broker

Hautz, an Insurance broker who lives at 5400 N. Lake dr., Whitefish Bay is a member of the city’s commission on human rights and a national leader in the Bahá’í faith which seeks to combine all the great religions of the world into one faith, which will unite mankind.  

Hautz said he found too many Christians didn’t know about Christ, Buddhists hadn’t read the teachings of Buddha, Jews hadn’t studied the law of Moses and Moslems didn’t know their Qur’án. He blames this on “organized priestcraft”  

“The result,” he said, “is a sorry lot of ignorant people all over the world, easily inflamed and led to excesses by ignorance and fanaticism born of prejudice and taking its toll in human relations everywhere.”  

### Asks Universal Language

What the world really needs, Hautz concluded, is a universal language; recognition of basic moral law as the universal standard by which differences can be judged; free trade, universal currency, a common standard for weights and measures, and universal education.  

“All countries derive their basis of government from their religion,” he said, “but there has been so much ritual and dogma and superstition added.”  

“If religion were left to the orthodox elements anywhere in the world, no religious freedom would exist.”  

He said the Bahá’ís, now established in 200 countries, were trying to answer the call of the Lord’s prayer: “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth.”  

### Taxi Mechanics’ Strike Is Ended

Seven striking mechanics of the Checker Cab Co returned to work Tuesday after voting Monday afternoon to end an 11 day strike.  

They are members of the AFL International Association of Machinists. The strike did not affect cab service.  

The mechanics settled for a 10c an hour increase, their new wage rate ranges from $2 to $2.15 an hour according to Julius Drozewski, a business representative of the union.  

The company had offered 10c again before the strike began. The union had asked for 15c now and additional increases later.

Well we are on our way back after a most glorious visit at Haifa where had the privilege of seeing much of the Guardian. We certainly were blest because Shoghi Effendi on account of our stay being so short asked us out to Bahjí and we spent the whole day with him. Shoghi Effendi is very pleased to have the prayers of the believers. No one can be disappointed in meeting Shoghi Effendi – so young, so sweet and yet so much dignity. One feels that speaks “with authority” as did Jesus and at about the same age as Jesus when crucified, a little older, for Shoghi Effendi is 24. The last evening he called Emma and me over to the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, into the room where the Master used to received His guests. His face was illuminated and afterward, the next morning when I woke up it came to me that, that night he looked like end of pictures of Bahá’u’lláh, which the Greatest Holy Leaf. (Shoghi Effendi says the correct translation is “Exalted”) – had shown in the afternoon. He was so sweet always to Emma and insisted on her sitting next him at the table.  

We went to Nazareth, Tiberias, Bethsaida (on sea of Gallee) and to Caper where Jesus said there wouldn’t be one stone left upon another, and there are all those broken columns of this once beautiful synagague. They have restored a little of it to show that it once was. Was glad to dip my hands in the ___ Church of Annunciation at Nazareth – visited place supposed to the ___ Mary and Joseph.

Many preparations being made for war abroad. Shoghi Effendi is expecting war, but says it is not immediate.  

Had a most wonderful stay in Haifa. Shoghi Effendi never seems to forget promise and I am sure what be promised for you will not be forgotten. One marvels that he doesn’t forget he has so much to think of – many responsibilities. We had dinner with him at Bahjí. Emma, Jackie and I sitting in the dining room where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to sit and looking into the great open court with a garden in the center, where stands a tree laden with yellow ___ – each one worth their weight in gold, to us. They do not pick them only use them as they drop for ‘Abdu’l-Baháloved to look upon them. In a stable opening out of this court yard is where Naz the grey donkey lives daughter of the Naz outdoors she has to walk through the dining room. This arrangement holds throughout the East, that the animals may not be stolen but it seemed strange to us. After lunch we rested and Shoghi Effendi went with Jackie to the porch of the Mansion where she was painting the view to be seen from them on a four foot canvas. Her picture is to be placed in the Hall of the Mansion and it will certainly be a lasting monument to her  for it will be a great happiness to the believers of the future, for the view necessarily will change as the years go by as regards trees, buildings, etc.. although Mt. Carmel in the distance and ‘Akká at its foot and the blue Mediterranean will continue to with-stand time, but Carnel will change also for beautiful buildings will be erected there. The prison of ‘Akká and the Mosque with its round green dome and minaret are plainly visible from the porch and in a distance one has a glimpse of the Riḍván. Late in the afternoon Shoghi Effendi ordered a carriage and took s to the “Red Hill” not far from Bahjí and where Bahá’u’lláh loved to go and pitch a tent and receive His friends. This hill in the spring is covered with red anemones and later, red poppies – hence its name. Returning from the Red Hill we went with Shoghi Effendi to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh where he chanted for us and asked Him to recite the “Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh”. Then he had to return to Haifa but we stayed overnight and returned to the Pilgrim House in Haifa early the next afternoon and the Greatest Exalted Holy Leaf showed us the picture of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Then that same evening, Shoghi Effendi sent us to come over to the house. He received us in the room where “‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to receive His guests. The next morning we left for Jaffa to take our boat.

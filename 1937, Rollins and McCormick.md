##  Two Statements From the Guardian 

There is not a Bahá’í in the world that can be hurt if they follow a very simple rule. They can stand all the unwisdom of their sisters and brothers, the slights and the slanders, if they will do one thing only (three times he struck his hand, the back of it, into the palm of the other while he said)   

<q class="shoghi">“Say the Greatest Name instantly,
Say the Greatest Name instantly,
Say the Greatest Name instantly.”</q>   

The Guardian’s other statement was this: <q class="">“Every Bahá’í in the world could be a teacher and a speaker. How? Like this: </q>  

Every Bahá’í should memorize Bahá’í Prayers. Every Bahá’í should memorize Bahá’í Principles. Every Bahá’í should memorize some of the talks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, some of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh (short passages), also some of the other writings. Then, he said, these are the tools that you put into the subconscious mind; and you can stand before any audience and never be struck for something to say.   

Even if you start out with a prayer in a sincere and humble manner, the Supreme Concourse on high will assist you and you will never be at a loss for words.

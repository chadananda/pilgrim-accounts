###  1924 

In 1924 and 1925 Fred made return visits to Haifa to meet Shoghi Effendi, with whom he developed a close relationship. After their first meeting, Shoghi Effendi referred to him as “My beloved Fred, that living torch, lit by the spirit of our departed Master [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]” and as a “zealous and promising disciple of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”4Shoghi Effendi readily recognized Schopflocher’s “clear understanding of, and entire devotion to, the interests” of the Bahá’í Faith,5 and Schopflocher gained a devotion to Shoghi Effendi that was “immediate and lasting.”

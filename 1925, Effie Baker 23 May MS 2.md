Dear Friends and Co-workers,  

I am again late in writing my letter, but as you know I try to do the most important things first, and I had quite a number to do the last week.  

Yesterday, we had a young American lady and her mother to dine with us. She has been sent by the St. Stephen College, Missouri, to investigate the various Religious Movements in the East, as she came to see Shoghi Effendi. She was a very nice girl and showed that she was very spiritual as well as intellectual, and it was very interesting to hear her speak on the new broad methods they are trying out in their college. They have been observing the students to ascertain whether they have been observing trend or whether they are void of it, and they find that they are really spiritually inclined, but this is the time when Religion must go hand in hand with Science. They have been working along the lines of a broad and sane interpretation of the Sercon on the Mount, and their endeavour has been to try and give a reality or life to each student & faith, thus they try and urge a student to go back to his community and put vitality into it. They certainly have received the rays of the Sun of Truth, not knowing from whence they come. Probably after her interview with Shoghi Effendi this morning, she may be able to recognize the source.  

Rúḥí Effendi and I represented the Bahá’í Community at the Service held at the little War Cemetery here to commemorate Justice Day, and on behalf of Shoghi Effendi placed a wreath on the Cenotaph, also a wreath of Gum leaves for the 28 Australian and the one New Zealander who lie there.  

Mrs. Hoagg leaves for Italy on Saturday morning. We shall miss her very much.  

Shoghi Effendi received a copy of the “Herald of the South” this week, and he was very pleased with it, and urges its Editor to try and develop and expand its scope. He was pleased to see that the friends in Australia and New Zealand are corresponding with other countries.  

Today, we celebrate, according to Muḥammadan call, the declaration of the Báb and the birthday of the Master. We will visit the Holy Tomb this afternoon. Shoghi Effendi went and spent the night with Bahjí. I wish to ask the friends if they send any papers to Shoghi Effendi, to please mark the article they think he would like to see and if possible underline the paragraph that has any bearing on the Movement etc. He spends so much of his valuable time searching over papers to see what the friends have sent them for. You have no idea what a stupendous task it is to cope with his mail. Personally I think it is better not to forward papers unless they have something vital pertaining to the Cause.  

Shoghi Effendi was pleased to the reference to the Persecution in Persia written by Mr. Brewer and also the article (I think Mrs. Blundell sent me the paper containing it) in the Aukland paper which gave Martha Root’s account. He has forwarded the reports to the Ṭihrán Assembly.  

I trust that you are all keeping together in a united little band and doing your utmost to assimilate and put into practice these teachings which are certainly the solvent for today’s problem.  

As yet we had no rain, and it is badly needed now. The Gardens at the Holy Tomb are getting more beautiful everyday and should in a short time be full of bloom.  

Shoghi Effendi and the Holy Family desire me to send you their love and Greetings in which I heartily join.  

In His Name.
 
Your loving Sister and Co-worker.

### Some Words of Gratitude to God For the Blessings Which Came From a Visit to the Rome of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

On March 14th, 1907, {{p1}} Mr. Chase, Mr. Scheffler, Mr. Agnew, Rúḥu’lláh and myself left Chicago for Boston enroute for a visit to the home of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. On the 15th of March we sailed from Boston on the steamer “Republic” and reached Naples on March 31st (Easter Sunday). To our surprise we found upon reaching Naples that both Mrs. True and Arna were there, they having just come from ‘Akká.  

On April 3rd at noon we sailed from Naples to Alexandria on the steamer “Oceana”, reaching Alexandria April 6th, and left the following morning by train to Port Sa‘íd. We then went immediately to the steamer which brought us to Haifa in the following evening. After meeting Mírzá Asadu’lláh in Haifa, we learned that we were to go to ‘Akká the next morning. On April 10th, Wednesday at noon, we reached the home of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.   

Perhaps everyone who is contemplating a trip to ‘Akká has had some imagined idea concerning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the home, surroundings, etc., and because it is imagined, it is sure to be different, possibly, contrary.  

We have the photographs in America of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá taken when a youth – his hair looks dark, also his eyes and his features somewhat sharp. But when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came into our room shortly after our arrival, we saw an elderly gentleman with white hair, blue eyes, and a face full of love and tenderness, which far exceeded our expectations, and which bore no likeness to our photograph.  {{p2}}

And how could a face full of the expression of Spiritual Life ever be photographed on paper and do credit to GOD’S Love. Impossible! It is to be demonstrated in the Life, both by the Everlasting Words and by His Deeds.   

It was really not these outward signs of a physical man that we were to discover and become acquainted with, while in ‘Akká; it was a spirit which before we left, so enveloped us that we discovered we had breathed from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Life a new life, and by coming in contact with His Spirit had inhaled a new spirit.   

The Spiritual Face of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was a face which was and will be through all ages to come, one of perfect patience, perfect resignation, and perfect humility before the Throne of GOD’S endowments. This Spiritual Face in ‘Akká is that Face severed from all else save GOD.   

In that city of ‘Akká in the Life and Heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dwells that wonderful Spirit of GOD’S power that makes the heart of man move by It’s flow, for from this Point comes the WORD OF GOD to the world to create within men Eternal Life.  

How could one hear a beautiful musical composition without becoming charmed; the impression is perfect, it will remain with the senses a long time. If this is so with sound, how much greater will it be with a spirit whose soul is listening for a note from the Real Musician who sings but the Words of GOD.  

It is from these spiritual Words spoken in ‘Akká by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, when personally spoken to man – drives deep into his heart, and changes him from his old self into a something new – which in itself is unexplainable. When one leaves ‘Akká, if the soil of that heart has been touched with the love of GOD, he cannot but feel as though something has occured; and in wonderment he looks around within his thoughts at it all. {{p3}}

Truly it is the Power of GOD in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá which drives home to the very heart, that makes the individual a child of that home (or call it spirit) and the spirit becomes inseparable from It’s Power <u>if</u> that child will remain in that Home in prayer in service. The Road leading to the Home of is reached only in ‘Akká, for there He has made to come forth His Life, His Love and His service. If we love GOD and wish not to become the “Prodigal Son” we will cling to Him by obedience to His Words, and like that Spiritual Face of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, we too will do as He does, and be as He is, for sake of GOD, because this is GOD’S Wish and Will for us.  

When tasting this Spiritual Food in the Revealed Word of GOD, then witnessing the Life in how could one wish to wander away from It’s Protecting Shelter; for there is shelter, love, protection and Wisdom from a Loving Father unto every creature of the world. His Love is demonstrated not to the personality of the man, but because the man loves the whole world.   

The WORD OF GOD is the Book of Life; it is the Tree of His Knowledge; it is the Sun of Truth whose brightness makes the heart of man wipe away Wall traces of sorrow, as man imprints the Words of GOD in his own heart, and shows the world that the King has really came. Has It not made the heart glad, full of the Love for GOD, the joy for a world made by Him. Is not, the cause of creation itself from these very facts? This wonderful spiritual example in ‘Akká sees but GOD, lives but God’s Life, speaks but for GOD; and His Wish is that a likewise.   

We see Him entertaining at tea people who are rested only in the world. One day several officials spent the entire day with Him, and He told us how difficult had been the day.  {{p4}}

One morning as we looked out of our bedroom window in the garden where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, has his tent, we saw a bride and groom dressed in their wedding garments. They had come for some little Words of Love and comfort from the lips of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In the afternoon of this day, we again looked down in the garden and saw a small crowd of Catholic Sisters. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was up stairs in His room when we heard Him call out to them; and with faces smiling, we heard them call back to Him and shortly He was down among them. And such are lessons in ‘Akká of tender patience and endurance.  

We certainly bore witness to GOD’S service, to that patience, to His Love; and under all conditions we realized it was from that Tree of Life, from that Real Garden whose flowers are only purity, only holy and above the power of any human man’s hand to destroy; for it is of GOD – GODLY. Here are ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Words of which we have witnessed It’s Reality.  

“The Tree of Life which is full of blossoms, leaves and fruits, the shade thereof is peace to the soul, and a rest to the consciousness. Whosoever be under this Tree will certainly partake of fruit. But shade trees are many in the forest, which though fresh and verdant, are never-the-less fruitless.”  

On Tuesday, April 16th, we were to leave ‘Akká by the wish of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; and in His loving Words were these: “If you go now it will make it easier and possible for those coming after you to come.”   

When we left ‘Akká and arrived in Haifa, we began to see a few of those who were “Coming after us,” for we met in Haifa Miss Edith Sanderson from Paris, who arrived in Haifa the morning after we came.  {{p5}}

When we reached Port Sa‘íd we met Mr. Roy Wilhelm and his dear Mother of New York City, and then we went on to Cairo where we again met Mrs. Allen and Miss Moore (Lua Gettsinger’s sister) both of Washington; all on their journey to that which we had just left: - of love, of spiritual heat, of spiritual fire and the greatest mercy that GOD has bestowed upon the soul of man.   

May GOD in His mercy grant to all the people of the world His Words of LIFE, that they may take them into their lives to live, place them on their lips to breathe and help them to become reflectors of this Great Light.   

We ourselves can get no revelation, for the REVELATOR has come. It is by the drinking in of His Words of Life that we acquire Knowledge, that we get Faith, and that we get Love for GOD; and it is enough to make us rich through all Eternity.  

WORDS of Bahá’u’lláh: “O nightingale of Paradise, the Branch of Life is waving to and fro. It is time for thee to sing thy harmony and to give unto the world the joy of Love.”

## HISTORY OF THE VIOLATION OF 1. KHAIRALLAH

### Doctor Zia, Ibrahim Khairallah

### 1920

After drinking the afternoon tea, ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ said:  

“Doctor Zia, Ibrahim Khairallah was an insignificant man and never could make his living in Syria or Egypt. I sent him to America and assured him that he would be confirmed. In America, he found that all the doors were open before his face. Then he became arrogant, and thought he was great. When he first came here, he praised Lua Getsinger and her husband and he requested me to appoint them as leaders in America. I did not heed his request. He sent Lua to Mrs. Hearst and she gave her twelve hundred dollars and sent two hundred dollars to Ibrahim Khairallah through ‘Abdu’l Karim. Khairallah came to me, weeping and com¬plaining. He said, ‘Is this right, that Lua Getsinger should receive twelve hundred dollars, and for me only two hundred dollars, and even this much was never given to me? When I saw him weeping for money my heart was shocked at him. Then he asked to expel Mr. & Mrs. Getsinger   

I said, ‘No, that is not possible, because that would be harmful to you. He asked, ‘Why is that?’ I said, ‘Then they will become your enemies, and certainly harm comes from enemies.’  

“While he and his wife were in my presence he spoke in Arabic, accusing her of terrible things. I knew that he was dishonest and she was innocents, that if she had any faults, he was the one to be blamed for it. Iherefr)re, I showed the more kindness to her.  

“Finally, he asked me to make him the leader in America. I told him to drop the thought of leadership and to be severed and sanctified. He became very angry: Then the violators deceived him and agitated him. Their custom is that as soon as they learn that someone is angry they go to him and show him their sympathy, and to agitate him and plant in him the seeds of hatred. Thus Ibrahim Khairallah became an enemy. I found such a soul in like a deadly poison to the Cause of GOD. How could I trust him in all the affairs! Therefore, I had to shun him.  

“If Ibrahim Khairallah had not violated the Covenant; the growth of the cause in America would have been astonishing. Three hundred souls; in Chicago turned away from the Cause in one day on account of violation. I sacrifice my life to the holy souls, but what can I do with the selfish and egotistical people Khairallah and those who are similar to him have taken the Cause for their own material benefit, fame, name, influence, and for the formation of their work and business. If they remain in the Cause, it is a blow to the Cause, and if they are out it is a blessing.  

“Khairallah is the hero of the violators. He wants to establish a center in Brookline. Far from it! As to the foam - it will dry up, but what benefits the people will remain in the earth. The rain and streams irrigate the lands. Every land absorbs water and is benefitted in propor¬tion to its capacity. But the existence of foam is inevitable. However, the foam will dry up, and that which benefits the people will remain in the earth.”  

The writer mentioned 	his meeting with Ibrahim Khairallah, to convey to him his Master’s message. He (the writer) asked Khairallah the.

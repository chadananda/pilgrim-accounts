During our first meeting with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá after our arrival in His Presence on the morning of October 25rd, after our beautiful Welcome and while tea was served to us, He spoke as followers Some started to come to that Blessed Spot and never reached their destination. We were all here in unity. The journey was long and full of trial, but we had at last met and this meeting would be the cause of our meeting in the Kingdom above. ‘He asked about the Cause in America and then asked for the believers in New York and what was the condition of unity in its Assembly. He said the Cause in America was now like the down; it was like the spring time, and like the first shoot of growth, but that later it would grow into a tree. He said all the believers in America were present when we were present.  

Having another engagement, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not with us at the noon meal which later followed.  

At the table talks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá given during our Visit, Mírzá, Munír always interpreted.  

Evening of October 23rd, our first meal with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”  

At this table you will not find material comfort, but you will find spiritual comfort. The spiritual comfort must be of your heart and soul. Fort a lover in the house of his beloved is so intoxicated with love that he does not care. I invite you to this spiritual table. From the heaven and bounty of the Blessed Perfection I want you to partake of that table. The material table is found everywhere.  

After a silence ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: I praise this fact that women have made progress. They are, in America, to surpass the men. In Persia the men surpass the women. In the Kingdom there is no  

difference. All are good. Praise be to GOD, the Love of GOD is in their hearts! When women progress, some other foot is shown.  

In Persia, many men surpassed Kurret-al-Ayn in knowledge and eloquence, and were more illumined, but she, being a woman; manifested a greater work. The maidservants in America are good souls and are advano1ng.e Among those supplications from America, there are ten from women to one from men.  

The sun shines upon all and each receives from it and reflects according to capacity. Judgment is given according to capacity.  

Come and assist to elevate woman to her true dignity and station. Such as you find in this lamp – the oil and the wick – the power to ignite it. But the power in the light is only for this room. . But in man there is a power of flame to enlighten the world. This oil, when else touches it, will be ignited but that power in men, when touched by the Love of GOD, will be instrumental in enlightening the world.  

not known. He said that Mary was engaged to Joseph, and Joseph, on the night of their wedding, found that she was with child, and asked her: “What is this?” and she answered; “This is from the Holy “Ghost.” “I told him: “May GOD curse you for what you have said. Christ was the Spirit of the spirits; the Light of the lights; the Mystery of the mysteries; the Sun of Truth!” He asked: “What is the peace of it?” He wanted an existing proof, for he said that all of these miracles which were applied to Kim are false. I told him, consider this present proof, that Christ was but one soul, and is called and brought together all the different nations and races under one tent. Is it possible to perform such an achievement thro human power? He arose alone and singly. What greater proof do you ask than this?  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá often offered us bread and honey, and after a pause He said: I hope, when you go back to America, that you will be transformed like this honey, you will be so sweet. Some people are very bitter, while others are sweet. Those spiritual souls and divine persons are very sweet.  

There is no greater pleasure in the world than when the different races, nations and creeds matter together and are united. Such a gathering as ours here has no equivalent in the world, with such, unity, harmony and love. We are not gathered here because we are of the same country. The oneness of language has not gathered us here. Oneness of politics has not gathered us here. Oneness of interest has not brought us together.  

Nay, rather, it is the belief, and the assurance, and the Love of GOD, the power of the WORD of GOD, and the Unity of the world of humanity that has united us; and this is the Eternal Unity and Love.  

In America, praise be to GOD, the cause has become famous and well known. In most of the cities believers are found. They recognize The Physician. Now they must not according to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. They must use the medicine appointed by the Real Physician. They have to compare their actions with the teachings so that all the people may witness and beer record that these people are real Bahá’ís. A sick person knows the physician and receives the medicine, but when he does not use it, what is the use of it? Therefore, the beloved of GOD must endeavor to make all their thoughts and intentions the practice of the teachings and commands.  

If a man is named a “Bahá’í” but his deeds do not assert the fact, what is the use of that? The balance, or standard, is action. A Bahá’í is to be known by his actions, not only by his words and pretensions. Therefore Christ has said, You shall know the tree by its fruits. The sign of the iahai is,- to be sincere. He is trustful, detached from the world, attracted to the Holy Spirit, is contented, is kind to all the people, and in the service of the Cause is a devoted one. He is well assured, steadfast, and endures every calamity and difficulty. In the world of humanity such a man is in fact a Bahá’í. Otherwise he bears the name – nothing more.  

If one should wholly abstain from meat and he contented with vegetables, it would be much better. And how difficult it is for a man to kill an animal and to prepare the food for himself. But as it is already killed and we find it in the market, we buy it. As it is new killed, it is better to take and eat it than to leave it to so

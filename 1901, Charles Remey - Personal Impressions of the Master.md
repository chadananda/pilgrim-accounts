Dear Co-worker, <br>
In His Holy Cause: —   

I send you the following extract from a paper which, at the request of a brother Believer, I prepared to be read before some Truth Seekers. I trust it may be of sore assistance to you in your work of spreading the Glad Tidings of The Final Fulfillment of GOD’S Covenant with His People.

###  Statement of a few personal impressions of the Master together with some observations regarding His Title of “The Center of The Covenant”.   

During my stay of eleven days in The Master’s house in March 1901, I was constantly impressed by His wisdom and understanding, not only of the visible or objective things of life, but more especially of those Unseen spiritual conditions of being which, because they are not seen with the physical eye, nor comprehended by mental reason alone, are the more difficult to understand. These soul conditions are the very root and cause of the visible or objective conditions to which man finds himself subject.   

Through the Master’s Teaching one realizes that the outer man is but the manifestation of the inner or spiritual man, and that in order to permanently correct and perfect the outward condition of mankind the remedy must be applied to the understanding of the real cause of these conditions. The Master’s wisdom is the real wisdom — which has to do with this invisible or spiritual side of existence.   

I saw The Master as the Divine Physician of mankind. The one who knows and understands all conditions of soul, for his understanding penetrates deeper than the mind. I was deeply impressed by his understanding of my inner-self.   

One would naturally resent any one’s attempt at reading his thoughts, but how different is his attitude towards one who from a height of soul unfoldment (gained, through sacrifice and suffering, for the Christ Life can be obtained only in this way), can penetrate the heart and silently give that divine strength and assurance — which every soul craves.   

Man has a divine nature and that nature needs to be fostered and nourished.	This craving for divine knowledge is but the manifestation of laws working in the spiritual realm, analogues to those which we see everyday working upon the lower planes. This divine law The Master understands. He gives us his strength to help us over	rough places and at the same time he shows us and teaches us how to understand our own spiritual needs and how through obedience to this higher law, to keep our souls nourished and alive in GOD.   

The advice and admonitions of The Master are both special and general in their natures. To individual souls he gives special and personal advice, through the carrying out of which each soul receives strength and enrichment. To his followers, the Bahá’ís as a body, he gives general instructions and admonitions applicable to all, and which when acted upon are conducive to the spread of divine knowledge and unity, and to the general welfare of the body of Believers as a whole. Thus it will be seen that the Masters work is that of leading souls to GOD. In this day all depends upon his guidance, and at the same time, all depends upon whether or not we are willing to be led by Him in the Divine Way.   

Not every one who visits the Master and sees him with the outward eye, sees him with the inner spiritual eye. Outwardly he is like any other man, but inwardly he is entirely different. He stands unique! The indwelling spirit within him we only see as we look beyond his human personally. When we do this, we see that his personality is but the servant of the spirit within, and when once we see and understand this; we are prepared to have revealed to us the knowledge which he has in store for us.   

In attaining to the presence of the Master the one thing to be avoided is the veil of our own personal imaginations and self-dependence. He teaches us to place our dependence upon GOD, and to be guided by His Holy Spirit. His message is a spiritual one which we must hear with our spiritual ears through the voice of the spirit. When we go to the Master, free from all thought of self, laying aside our own wishes and devices, and with open hearts earnestly seeking the light which he has, then we are in a condition to receive in the fullest measure those divine blessings which he has in store for us. On the other hand if we go to him self-sufficient and with our hearts closed we have neither eyes to see nor ears to hear what he has to impart to us.   

The Covenant of GOD made with mankind through the Prophets of the past, and which He has renewed from time to time since the beginning of history through His various revelations, has been consummated in this Latter Day Revelation. The Promise given was that the People of GOD would inherit the earth. By this was meant that the Christ Life within man would predominate and overcome his human and animal natures, and that divine law should supplant that of men upon the earth. By the outpouring of Truth through the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh this divine state of man is being realized, and we now have the Final Fulfillment of The Great Promise of GOD to His People.   

The Master was the first to recognize and declare Bahá’u’lláh as the promised teacher and deliverer of the world, and he was the first to attain to the station of perfect submission to the Devine Will, from whence comes his name “‘Abdu’l-Bahá” which means, “Servant of GOD”.   

This is the highest condition of spiritual attainment and is the practical application of the divine or Christ Life.   

The Mission of The Master is that of establishing within our reach, and making ready and possible the way for the people of the World to receive the Truth revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. This abundance of Truth or Divine Life is always to remain with mankind upon the earth as a testimony of the fulfillment of GOD’s Promise to the world. The Master is the First Fruit of the Consummation of the fulfillment of this promise, and is the Center from which the Light is now being radiated to the people of all nations of the world. Therefore he in his mission lives and exemplifies in every way his title of <q class="">“The Center of The Covenant”</q>.   

### Utterance from the Hidden Words from the Arabic   

“O Son of Him. We stand by His Own Entity in the Kingdom Himself! Know that I sent unto the Fragrances of Holiness, and have accomplished the Word in thee, have fulfilled the Bounty through thee, and have willed for thee what I have willed for Myself. Therefore be content in Me and thankful to Me”.   

Faithfully your brother,<br>  
In His Path,

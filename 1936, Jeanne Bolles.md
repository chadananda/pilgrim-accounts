Prejudice is still hampering standing in the way of the successful teaching of the Bahá’ís. Different prejudices in different countries, such as class prejudice in England, political prejudice, race prejudice, etc. in Germany. In America it is the white believers have to struggle in their relations to the colored. In Austria political . The Austrians have been a great empire and are very proud. They are now however a small country. They resent being included with the Germans, this is natural, also because they are politically free. In England class prejudice is pronounced, the upper classes wish to remain aloof. Everywhere in the world exists religious prejudice. The Guardian hinted that the believers must overcome all of these prejudices.   

The Guardian spoke of the new Yearbook and mentioned with apparent pleasure that the queen and again written a preface to it, and that she had referred to Bahá’u’lláh as the Father. He said the “coming of the Father” meant the return of the on in the “station” of the Father, but we must be very careful explaining that station. God for, instance cannot be contained in the “form” of man, but the coming of Bahá’u’lláh means the coming of the “Father spirit” to a world rapidly growing into maturity. That now the world is still like a young man restless to do things, to accomplish more. Like a young man at the threshold of maturity, to the world is restless feeling its maturing, its “coming of age” He seemed pleased by the message of the Czechoslovakian singer that she wished to serve him and quickly replied: He who serves the Cause is giving at the Holy threshold...  

The American friends has a tendency to confuse the station of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; they often spoke of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the prophet, whereas he is the sole interpreter of the teachings, the center of the Covenant; he was not a prophet, nor a Guardian, but his station was unique, it never before existed in religious history. The Báb was first a prophet and second a forerunner to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.   

In Palestine there are now recognized, Bahá’í marriages. The formula (certificates) is obtained from the government. Four certificates are used. One is given to the wife, one to the husband, one the Local Spiritual Assembly receives and one to the government. The actions of the Bahá’ís have to be extremely cautious in Palestine. They are strictly neutral in their attitude towards the political and religious struggle of the Arabs and Jews. They are closely watched and there are enemies of the Cause watching for a chance to prove that the Bahá’ís sympathies are with the Jews or the Arabs.

Bahá’ís all over the world must comply with the fundamentals of the World Order.  

In non-essentials, however, that is in details, national development is encouraged, traditions, characteristics and the individual.  

There is no use having a Youth group before having a local assembly. France, England and Germany have Youth groups which should be developed. All their activity must be under the supervision of the Local Assembly. There must never be a conflict of authority. The National Assembly is supreme in national affairs and the Local Assembly. The Youth Committee may be regarded as a sub-committee. If it was otherwise they would become a rival of the Local Assembly. An Assembly must not unduly interfere in the activities of a believer, but at the same time it is held responsible for any mistakes. Every Bahá’í activity must be under the supervision of the Assembly. Discipline is vital and important.   

The Western Pilgrim house is owned by the American National Spiritual Assembly (Palestine Branch). Its value is about 20,000 pounds. The American N.S.A. (Palestine B.) owns besides the Pilgrim house 250 to 260,000 square pica (approx. 30,000 square metres) of land and a small tract of land between ‘Akká and Bahjí. It took three years to establish the Palestinian Branch of the American National Spiritual Assembly. It is now legally incorporated in Palestine with seal and stamp. As yet there are only two braes established, the American and the Indian, but in the future all the National Spiritual Assemblies will own property. In apse of war, complications will set in through this world ownership.  

Every Bahá’í transaction in Haifa has to be signed by the son of Muḥammad-‘Alí, Mustapha Bahá’í. He has created nastily difficulties for the Guardian in regard to these transactions, but over thirty of them have been completed (that is, transfer of lard to the name of a National Spiritual Assembly).   

The ownership of the land by the N.S.A.’s of the East and West consolidated the area around the shrines, The government is very pleased about the terms of the Bahá’ís who agree not to build on their property ,etc. because Haifa is “growing up” Mt Carmel. A monastery on a large property almost reaching to the sea had to pay such a large tax that it was necessary to sell a part of the property (they insisted on selling this property to Christians.)   

All Bahá’í property is exempt from taxation in the Holy Land. The reason other religious property is not exempt is because they build on their property and commercialize their land.   

The teachings in general are translated Into 36 languages. There are seven or eight N.S.A.’e in the world. In Persia there are over 500 local communities, but they are not yet functioning properly. The number of N.S.A. is of no importance. As soon as the Caucasus and Turkestan have their N.S.A.’s, the International House of Justice will be formed. There are no believers In Spain, in Greece or in Poland. (There is no Polish literature). To have someone in these countries is necessary an anchor, even if only one believer, however incompetent however or the executive ability may be.  

The Americans should think of South America, Mexico and Europe, not the Orient or Africa.

### 1952

Excerpts from Nura Mobine, just returned from Haifa. This letter was sent to Elinor and Bob Wolff, our pioneers in South America, who are sharing it with us. They sent the excerpt to Iris Fresco, with the hope that the friends would receive inspiration, as they, the Wolffs had done.  

“We arrived there 6 in the afternoon, and stayed in eastern pilgrim house, which was very beautiful, and surrounded with oriental love and hospitality. Our host was Dr. Luṭfu’lláh, who is an angel. This man is a being simple of love and devotion toward our Beloved Guardian and the true servant of His Holyness Bahá’u’al1ah.  

Half an hour after we arrived, Manuver, (the gardner) came and said:  

The Beloved is here. There was no time to think of anything, Núrí run out to the living room and I followed him. He kissed Núrí and I said “Alláh–u–Abhá. He showed us the chair and then I heard a voice that never before my life I have heard anything like it, as if this melodious voice was coming from another world, world of love, beauty and perfection. He asked how was our trip; then he told us how hard it was during the time of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh Por pilgrims to come from Írán, and just have a look at Him through the windows at the prison from a distance.  

By the time I pulled myself together and looked at Him, in order to paint this picture in the inner side of my heart and treasure it there for ever after. He is small, but so handsome, His hands are so beautiful and graceful. His eyes are the source of light, love and life. He told us how important the Shrine of the Báb is. He said this is the only place which is blessed by the two Manifestations. As you remember, it was near this place that His Holiness Bahá’u’1lah was sitting and has chosen the very spot for the Shrine of the Báb. And now the Body of the Báb is resting there for ever after.  

The Shrine is a place of art, it is white and with a green ribbon around her neck, and a crown of gold, just like a bride when I told to our Beloved Guardian how beautiful that building is, specially with the-——-? of lighting her at night. He said “Yes, I call her the Queen of Carmel.” You should see Him how happy and proud He is at this shrine.  

We were very lucky because during our pilgrimage He was always smiling because of people like you, who have rised and already man this glory and beauty. It is worth to give all we possess for just a smile at Him, because that came from the very being of His inner life, as if His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh is smiling. He said pioneers both save themselves and the Faith, He said never before anything such as this has happened in the wor1d. And He is so delighted with the ones that are in their post. God bless you people who are the cause of His joy.  

He said pioneers should be clean and just like the air, and passes by like the breeze. There is a lot in this sentence. The calamity or whatever God we may call it is for sure, but He said believers should not be scared; they should live under Bahá’í administration and be steadfast and detached. He emphasized so much for administration. He said both spirituality and administration should be together. He said it’s because of His unique pattern that after passing at the Beloved Master we did not have any deviation.  

As you know, He is always many years ahead of us, today he sees the glory of the world of tomorrow, therefore He is happy; He is the only human being that really and truly cares about God’s Creation.  

He not only loves the Bahá’ís, He just the same loves other people and it is because of them that He wants us scatter and share our precious jewel with the rest of humanity, what a Man and what a love. One day I asked Him when the house of Justice would be established, He said after we establish 50 more NSA plus the 12 that we already have, He said the international house of Justice is like the Dome of a building, it comes at the end.  

Now you see why He wants us to scatter. He told us one day that the LSA are called the little houses of justice, not house of mercy or forgiveness but justice. He said these institutions should act upon justice alone; never should look to the rank of importance of the people.  

I must tell you that He Himself is a sample of justice, to me His Justice is greatest way of love, a higher degree. His love for His Holiness Bahá’u’1lah and the Báb is unbelievable. He lives for them, He wants believers concentrate on them.  

This again is so just; never He say a thing that will show he has done something, either it is Bahá’u’l1ah or the Báb, or the believers have done it. How great a person is He, this again is the degree of His love for the source. He is a living picture of humbleness toward His Beloved.  

When He is talking He fills you up with the things that are lack of it you; this you notice later on.  

Now a few words about our shrines and Holy places in Haifa and ‘Akká. I must tell you that these things make a pilgrimage complete just being at the presence of our Beloved Guardian, then visiting the Shrines and the Holy places; and finally being with the Amatu-1-Bahá, Rúḥíyih <u>Kh</u>ánum.  

We have so many lovely places to visit, imagine to be in the same room that the Glory of God has lived, and everything in the room is just as it has been before, one cannot help feeling so sma and nothing. These places are so powerful that it is very hard sometimes to take it.  

But most of the time it gives you a real picture of our history, and brings you closer to the reality, and finally to your duty. The sense of responsibility never again leaves you alone; one can not sit quiet after visiting these places. Sometimes you feel as it His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh or the Master have just gone outside and will be back soon.  

Among the objects that we saw in our Archives, first was the picture of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh, which is the highlights of a pilgrim’s time. That picture is realistic; from His eyes you can feel power, glory, love, pity and finally you feel as the world is actually in those eyes, that is a picture that one-never- never one will let it go out of his life, if that happens to me I will be lost. In that picture He has long hair, long beard He is sitting in a chair, His lovely hands are resting in the arm of the chair. Another thing is the bloody shirt or the Báb after they took Him away from the trench. Another thing and the picture of the Báb, so young handsome and yet so innocent, all gives you one resolution and that is to be His servant for ever after.  

One day I asked for Beloved Guardian, how would it be if I go to my way back to South America. He said it is fine, and He told to give all them message to the believers down there. Unfortunately on my way back I could not do it. But now I am planning in a few months to there and maybe, be able to do a little in the work of Bahá’u’l1ah.  

P.S. Please write & tell as many people as you can about the importance of the Bahá’í Administration, of Cause to believers. This is a pillar on which the Faith is built upon it. Just to give you good news, for first time, in history of the Faith women in Írán can be elected in the Assemblies, I am waiting for the news. At the convention the hands will appoint the fingers what I mean is the board of nine, I will let you know when they are appointed.

He doubt more buildings will be built as time goes on but arch ARC the way that buildings will be placed as the ARC of the law Bahá’u’lláh mention in hid tablet of Mt. Carmel, The Law of God out Mt. Carmel mentioned in the Old Testament.  

My second thrill was in the Báb’s Shrine. Mr. & Mrs. Ioas took me up there. As we all bowed our heads in the threshold inside the shrine. Suddenly I started to cry and tears came so fast and furious, I could not stop. I don’t know what happened to me. Perhaps my soul was so overjoyed that my body though unaware of the bounty just cried for joy. So much my tears run over a tie and collar I looked like I was cought in the rain. At the Báb’s Shrine I prayed for all friends I could remember. First I started thinking of all the Bahá’ís in Phila, individually. Then all the Bahá’ís near Phila. Then all the Bahá’ís in the West Chester, and all friends in surrounding territory. I found that only when I prayed for others did I feel something warm in me. As soon as I started praying for myself that something left me. So in order to keep that something I felt within me, I had to keep on praying for others.  

What a thrill the first evening meeting our Beloved Guardian, He took me in His arms and kissed me. The latest pilgrim always sits at the head of the table. Shongi Effendi is served first, then Rúḥíyyih Khenum, then the latest pilgrim. Here is the way we eat when I was there. Mrs. Collins was not well and she did not attend the dinner here.  

What a thrill it is to sit near our Guardian a sign of God. Whose station we are not spiritual enough to understand. I was fortunate to sit near Him four evenings until another pilgrim arrive – then I took another’s place who left.  

My next great thrill was in the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. I got down on my knees, bent my head on the threshold on the inner room where His Holy bed is – floers and petals were strewn all over. In fact when I raised my head, my forehead was full of petals that stuck to the skin. I was with the seven other pilgrims at the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Each one of us made prayers in turn out for the prayer books. Six of the pilgrims were Persians. We slept two nights in the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh in ‘Akká. Here we gathered in His room where He ascended and prayed in turn. My next thrill was in the Garden in Bahjí where He sat so often. Here the aroma is wonderful. We picked lemons of the lemon tree – fresh lemon smell like flowers.   

Another thrill is to sit in the prison room where Shrine Bahá’u’lláh and family lived for awhile. In the “Son of the Wolf” I believe Bahá’u’lláh speaks of some words of Muḥammad where He says “Blessed are they that stand at the shores of ‘Akká and say ‘Alláh in ‘Akká’” with each wave for 40 waves.  

Well after we got out of the prison walls we went over near the sea and standing in a rock we said that – therefore fulfilling another wish I had I mind. Then we visited other places where the Holy family lived. The house was where Bahá’u’lláh got married – here we had a cooked pesian very good dinner in the same room ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had with his wife. When we got back to Haifa I felt so refreshed. When my nine days were up I still had five days before my ship was due to leave, so the Guardian suggested that I take a trip around Israel. So I went to Nazareth. Mostly Arabs live there. All kinds of churches are there. It is very hilly. Our Beloved Guardian told us to come back and spend the 10th day in Haifa. SO I had the pleasure of the meal He handed me a metal closed vial of Attar of Rose and kissed me again goodbye.  

The Guardian works very hard - his responsibility is great. He is in a way impersonal, He feels that one: a person has become a Bahá’í and made covenant with Bahá’u’allah the word come again in the station of the Father - that station has assumed also responsibility in the cause of Bahá’u’allah. He believes that it is our duty to help to carry the burden putting the Faith across to the whole world. That is why he calls us Co-workers. Of course Bahá’u’lláh speaks of our station-so high that were we to realize our station we would pass away and die. when one travels around as I did and observing people in various countries - how uncertain they are - actually what little religion they have, Most people in the world believe in God or religion only through tradition. It is a social function with most people rather than spiritual. As one so speaks to various people no matter what education» a Bahá’í realizes that he has certain knowledge that all others lack. I meet many students here as my place is close to the University. I have given out pamphlets to the ones that are interested. Usually the students of Philosophy will take a pamphlet because it is in their field of study.    

Well, I guess that I have bent your ears long enough. Again I want to thank you very much for your letter. I send my love to all of you and will keep in touch with you from tine to time.  

Bahá’í Love
 
Bonn Shriebman.  

Happy New Year

Please say the Remover of Difficulties so you can read my handwriting.  

P.S. 2.
 
I am giving the next Feast Bahá in Heidelberg. I am going to buy some small cards and write Hidden words in German so that all the friends here will take part. It will be something new to them.

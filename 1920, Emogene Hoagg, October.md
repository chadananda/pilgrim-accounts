### Oct 25th...

Told by Miraza Badi‘ Effendi.  

When General Allenby took Palestine he commanded the people of Haifa to make formal acknowledgement of the British victory by calling upon him to pay their respects.  

Afterwards he went personally to pay his respects to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and at the same time to show appreciation of the British Government for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s services to the poor during the war.  

At that time Gen. Allenby said that he was happy to call upon one who was the real ruler of the earth.  

Pilgrim House, Haifa.  

### Oct. 25th.

When the British Government first spoke of decorating ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Mírzá Badi‘, the Governor’s Private secretary said: “‘Abdu’l-Bahá does not receive decorations from Kings, he decorates Kings. However, inasmuch as he has accepted the persecution by the Turkish Government for 40 years, he will no doubt accept the honor you wish to bestow upon him.”

Miss Elizabeth Stewart’s trip from Ṭihrán, Persia as related by her.   

She left Ṭihrán Aug.7, I920 by automobile accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. New (English), their child, 6 years old and two babies, twins six weeks old (twins under Miss Stewart’s special care), and the; chauffeur, who was somewhat interested in the Cause.  

They arrived at Kaswin at five in the morning and remained over night. From there they went to Muḥammadan – Hamakan is old Ecbatana of the Bible – Here they remained two days at the home of some Scotch people.  

From Hamadán they drove all day and arrived at Kirmanshah, driving over the great pass Assadaba which is over 1000 ft. above sea level. The road was marvelous- made by the English, here they remained two days at the home of an English family (bankers). They were told that the Englis: and the Arabs were fighting because the Arabs had torn up the road. But on the third day they let them go on to the large camp, Kerina.  

There were 6000 tents at the camp – many soldiers and families,. They were given a tent and told they would have to remain a week. They were permitted to eat with the officers… officer’s mess.  

A large dairy was connected with the camp.  

Indian cows were used because they thrived best in the hot climate. Instead of being in camp one week they were there FIVE. From day to day they were told they might leave the following day. But it was five weeks when camp was broken up and they had to move another sixty miles distant.  

### November 2, 1920, Pilgrim House, Luncheon.

A. B. I wanted to come for breakfast this morning but could not. I have been serving the people at lunch at the other house and now I have come here.  

His Holiness Christ said, that the one who wishes to be greatest among you must be your servant. (In English) Good servant, good servant!  

One must be either a serpent or a servant; he must choose. The people who are arrogant are serpents not servants.  

It is very difficult to arrange the matter concerning Mrs. B’s land. The work which Asadu’lláh and Faríd did was not solid. At that time they should have secured a title from the government. They failed to do this. Now it would be better to sell it. It is worth twice as much as she paid for it. If she paid 100 lbs, sell it for 200 lbs. find out how much she paid, then after the price is found out it can be bought by someone. This is better. It is in the name of ‘Ináyatu’lláh, and not Mrs. B., so it can be sold. If it were in her name it could not be sold. I have thought much over this and have come to that conclusion. I will pay Mrs. B. the price if she is willing to sell. Send a cable and out and I will sent the money – thus the matter may be solved. It has been unsettled for ten years. This is better.  

Mrs. C. and Mrs. B. wished to give it to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá if it still belongs to her.  

A.B… I cannot accept it, as Mrs. B., is needy, but do not tell her this.  

I once bought a piece of land. There was a man who was very antagonistic and tried to prevent my securing a title; but with great difficulty everything was settled. This man even tried ro bribe the government. When it was all settled and my title was clear I sent word to baha’u’llah and He sent back word. “Leave the earth to the people of the earth” and I immediately destroyed the title and gave the land to the man.”  

Mrs. C… Yes, very good!  

Mrs. F.. “ll the land of Mt. Carmel belong to believers eventually.”  

A.B.. Yes, all the land of Haifa and ‘Akká belong to believers.  

Mrs. R.. mentioned about Mrs. Nourse’s land. Mt. Carmel, and asked if she should communicate with Faríd about getting it.  

A.B… I do not say to anyone to complain about another. She is authorized to do what she likes. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá does not command anyone to have a law suit. Cable to Mrs. B.  

Cpy of Cable: :Clear title to Brittingham’s lot:. Master says sell twice original price. Later buy another. Cable consent.  

(Signed) E. Cooper.  

### Nov. 4, 1920.. Pilgrim House.. Luncheon.

A.B…Yesterday was very pleasant with Arthur. No other chauffeur could managed. Today the auto should be clean the salt water ruins it.  

(To Arthur) you showed that you were an expert yesterday, but you should make Fugita and Khrosro like yourself.  

__ope that she will have spiritual __h...that is the real strength. __l strength will ultimately end in __s, but spiritual strength will not __owed by any kind of weakness, Praise be to God that you have attained spiritual strength. Your season is the springtime, your day is always -there is no darkness. You will __ys in the light.  

### 1920...Pilgrim House.

__ and Mrs. Dreyfus arrived last night Port Sa‘íd. They came from Paris some __o and have been delayed waiting for a __ Haifa.  

__all dined with our Lord, any pilgrims __fferent countries and representing __nt religions were with us.  

__ two children(boys) for whom the __s given for their education for one Badieh and ‘Abdu’lrasul. The father’s __ Ibrahim.  

__ir grandfather was the wonderful __ used to bring water to Bahá’u’lláh prison.  

__ day when he was carrying it under __k he was shot in the abdomen. He did __,but pressing in the protruding in__ he pushed on until he reached __lah, then he fell at his feet dead, __sed Beauty counted him as one of the __.  

### Nov. 16, 1920.. Pilgrim House.. Luncheon..

A.B... The Bahá’ís should sacrifice life __ in the path of each other.  

M. Dreyfus..said that Nos hugati(one who has __ a pilgrim house at Port Sa‘íd) has, served him and his wife very much and another friend, Jalál afshar had served them as well.  

A.B....I must be so that each one of the friends should prefer others to himself.. the others should be first to him.  

It has happened in Persia that one of the friends was caught and another sacrificed his life foe that one. The <u>Sh</u>áh wanted to kill some one...one of his friends said: ‘I am he’ so that the <u>Sh</u>áh might kill him and the other might go free.  

This is the measure of faith, that one should prefer the friend to himself, and should others first. His holiness Christ s said: ‘Do unto others as you would they should do unto you’, but Bahá’u’lláh has said ‘Prefer him to yourself’.  

Once they brought 7 of the friends to martyr them. Each one said: ‘Kill me first’ and why? Because they did not want to’ see the martyred bodies of the others.  

M. D.. In Paris it is not possible to invite many to our house at one time on account of conditions.  

A. B… Now, anywhere there are strikes. It is necessary that all the nations and people should make laws and regulations. At the end all the nations will be united so that no one can break those 1PWS. and re-gulationF. The Blessed Beauty has written that if it becomes other than this, then the result will be Bolschevism. Even her B... has been found.  

__ Blessed Beauty has plainly written there will be revolutions and dis__ncess. There are THREE classes: high __cated, middle and lower. This last __ are dominating. The common __le will dominate and that will be __ultion. Irreligion will prevail and __ to end the whole civilization of the __ will be destroyed. Then again religion __ be re-established.  

__ut 500 Jews came to Jaffa and asked for __nd were told to wait until work could __rund for them. They said: ‘We will not __. They became angry and joined the __hevics. There were some Muḥammadans, Christians who also became Bolschevics.  

__.. How long will irreligion prevail?  

__.. About 50 years longer. Now no one __eligious save the (real) Bahá’ís.  

__.. Will B... prevail in America?  

.. Bol.. will infest America as well.  

.. The drivers of the milk-wagons etc..  

__ receive from 50 to 80 dollars a week the school teachers receive much less.  

Notwithstanding this they complain. Did Fugita take a walk up the mountain? ...Yes.  

__ Be careful. If you fall you will __oll down the mountain.  

### 8. The Prison of ‘Akká. Told by Mírzá Badi‘. Jan. 15, 1920

One day all the pilgrims and the re__t believers were gathered together in Holy Tomb of the Báb. We had come together under the shade of the Tree of the Covenant and his Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke the Niagara Falls in America, saying that it is one of the greatest water falls in the world.  

In this connection He said that the rower the grandeur and the force of the water fall is an expression of this overflowing bounty of the Day of the Manifestation. Showing how great, majestic and powerful it is. These holy words of the Master reminds one of his influence upon great men of position and the leaders of mankind.  

Ever since the beginning of the occupation of Haifa (Sept, 1918) all sorts and conditions of men: military or civilians have had the honor and privilege of being in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.  

Field Marshal Allenby the commanding General of the Egyptian Expeditionary force visited Him several times and every successive visit was conducive to greater respect and consideration on his part. One day, together with the Master, he visited the prison of ‘Akká as well as the Holy Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh, an account of which the write: writer has already given in detail.  

Gen Money, the chief administrator of the occupied enemy territory administration south, and his successor, Major Gen. Watson, visited the Beloved several tires. The present chief administrator Major Gen. Bols, visited the holy Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh, together with Field Marshall Allenby, and had the pleasure of partaking of both material and spiritual food at the Master’s table.  

Those who have the privilege of being constantly with the Master can, to a certain extent, realize the difference in the attitude of those who visit him, and in this way can have an idea of the importance of the Cause.

# ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's Dream about Americans  
## Anna Watson  
### 1904 

------


One morning at early tea ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told us that He had a dream about America. He said that there were many sincere, earnest souls there. He said that in His dream He thought he was in a large room with a number of the Persians, naming them, and others also of the teachers there. These told Him that there were many earnest believers in America, but that they were far apart, and all playing on different musical instruments, so they did not play in harmony. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, I will see what I can do. Finding one, I told him to stay until I brought others to him, but when I came back with another, the first had gone away, piping in his instrument. And so it was; I could never get them together.” He added, “When I awake, I was very tired.”   

Miss B. said she hoped He would dream again that they were all united, and He smiled.

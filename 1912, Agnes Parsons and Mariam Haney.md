### Agnes Parsons and Mariam Haney

### 1912

*Mrs. Agnes S. Parsons and her companion Mariam Haney Left Washington, Monday night December 2nd,1912. *  

### December 3rd, 1912

Arrived in New York City, Tuesday morning, Dec. 3rd, 7 a.m. Breakfast at Cafe in Pennsylvania Station. Then drove to the Lucerne Hotel, 79th st & Amsterdam Av.  

After refreshing ourselves, we went directly to the house where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was temporarily abiding, No.273 West 90th St.  

> (I would like to have time and capacity and ability as well - to prayerfully record the nature of the welcome accorded us by our Divine Father, but this must be deferred until another time).

After most solicitous inquiries regarding our comfort and health - too tender and sweet for human description – we were invited to speak.  

Mrs. Parsons said she did not have any works to offer. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied: The intense love in the heart – the quality of the love which you have in your heart – both of you, is what you have brought to Me, and it is acceptable. Your hearts are enkindled”.  

In a very short time Mrs. Krug and Miss Louise Krug came into the room (‘Abdu’l-Bahá had sent for them). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself introduced Mrs. Parsons and Mrs. Krug, making a special point of it, and saying that He wished them to know each other very well, to know each other very well. This was repeated again. He also wished that they would correspond, and in the future that they would work together.  

After this conversation someone in the room (I do not know who it was, whether <u>Kh</u>án or Aḥmad) mentioned my name, and said was one of the oldest believers, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then said: “Mrs. Haney has strong faith. She is in a state of utmost illumination and Mr. Haney also.”  

I then referred to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s last Talk in Los Angeles and the impression it made on me, particularly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prophecy that some souls would arise in America who would be like the Persian believers, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied: “I testify that all those who are in this room now are just the same as the Persian believers.”  

> (Present in the room then with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá were-Mrs. Parsons, Mrs. Krug, Miss Krug, All Kull <u>Kh</u>án, Aḥmad Sohrab and Mariam Haney). 

After this ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told us to go and rest, and then to spend some time with Mrs. Krug.  

We returned to the Lucerene Hotel for a short time. Later lunched with Mrs. Krug at 83o Park Av. Present at the luncheon: Mrs. Parsons, Mrs. Krug, Miss Krug, Mírzá All Kull <u>Kh</u>án, MMe.<u>Kh</u>án, Valí’o’llah <u>Kh</u>án and Mrs. Haney.   

A meeting for all the believers at Mrs. Krug’s at 3 o’clock. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addressed this meeting. (I have given you copy of this Address). After the meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called us into the dining room at Mrs. Krug’s where tea was served.  

Soon thereafter ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left the house and called for us, granting us the great privilege of riding by His side in the motor to Mrs. Kinney’s house at 780 West End Av. Mrs. Kinney and <u>Kh</u>án also with us at this time.  

He told us to remain at Mrs. Kinney’s; that we were His guests that evening and we were to dine with Him. He then left us and went out alone.  

On His return He talked informally to some people who were waiting to see Him. (Copy of Notes taken then I have given you.)  

Later this same evening He addressed Mr. Kinney’s Bible class. And about 10:30 p.m. our Lord graciously permitted us to sit at His table and partake of material food with Him. After which He took us with Him in His motor to our hotel. <u>Kh</u>án was also in the motor at this time.  

### December 4th, 1912.

This morning we went again to the house our Lord occupied at 273 West 90th St. And again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá permitted us to see Him. (It was at this interview that your dream was interpreted).  

After this meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá invited us to ride with Him to the home of the Kinney’s where He was to meet all the believers. While riding He said He had ordered the motor especially for us, otherwise He would have walked. It was on this occasion that He told you to be happy; making a special point of it and repeating “You must be happy.”  

At 12 noon, the friends assembled at the Kinney house and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá talked to them. Aḥmad was the interpreter. I did not take this Talk.  

Later we went back to the Lucerne hotel for luncheon, returning immediately thereafter to the Kinney home. It was during this afternoon that ‘Abdu’l-Baba called all those up to His room who had contributed for the purchase of gifts to be sent to the members of the Holy Family, and told them they could send their love, that He would take their love but nothing else.(Aḥmad took the Notes of this Talk. I have asked him to translate same for me, but up to date it has not been forthcoming. He doubtless has been too busy. Someday I hope to get ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sublime Instructions at that time).   

Later in the afternoon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to the home of Mrs. Krug, thus very graciously giving an opportunity to Dr. Krug for a private interview.  

Returning to the home of the Kinney’s, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the dear Divine Father, and was telling His children of the interesting interview with Dr. Krug, when someone announced that it was time to go to the Theosophical Society where He was to give an Address. Again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá permitted us to ride with Him in the motor, both going to and coming from the hall of the Theosophical Society.  

Our Heavenly Father once more asked us to be His guests at dinner that night at the home of the Kinney’s, and after the dinner sweetly consented to allow you to take Him to 273 West 90th St. in the motor which you provided. <u>Kh</u>án and Mrs. Maxwell were with us at this time. After leaving our Lord, we took Mrs. Maxwell to her abiding place, and returned to our hotel about 12 p.m.  

### December 5th, 1912.

We went early to 273 West 90th St. to see our Lord, and He at once permitted us to come to Him. We found Him reclining on His bed. Mírzá Maḥmúd and Siyyid Asadu’lláh were rubbing or massaging His limbs; <u>Kh</u>án was reading from a newspaper. In a few minutes Valí’o’llah <u>Kh</u>án came into the room with breakfast for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, consisting of bread and cheese. Mrs. Kinney was also in the room. He permitted us to sit on the foot of His bed. In a short time the hour had arrived for going to the steamer which was to carry ‘Abdu’l-Baba away from the shores of America. The trip to the steamer was made in Mr. Mills’ motor; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá saying He would have accepted Mrs. Parsons invitation but He had already promised Mr. Mills. In the motor with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: Mrs. Parsons, Mt. Mills, Mts. Haney, and Valí’o’llah <u>Kh</u>án riding by the side of the chauffeur. Arriving at the steamer, all of the devoted children of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá followed Him every minute, even to His state room, where the distribution of all His gifts took place. Then back again to the “lounge” of the steamer where all were assembled and where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave His final Address in America. In a few minutes thereafter, the farewell greeting at the top of the stairs and we left the steamer. We remained on the Pier until the “Celtic”, with the Manifestation of GOD on board as the Real Captain, sailed away at 12 noon.  

When the steamer was about out of sight, we left the Pier and Mr. Mills kindly took us in his motor to the Pennsylvania Station, and at one o’clock we left New York, arriving again in Washington at 6.30 p.m. the night of the 5th of Dec. 1912.

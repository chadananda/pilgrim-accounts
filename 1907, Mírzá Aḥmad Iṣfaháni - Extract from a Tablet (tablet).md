To his honor, Mírzá Aḥmad {.greet} 

Upon him be Bahá’u’lláh-El-Abhá!  {.sit}

HE IS GOD!  {.sit}

O thou who art firm in the Covenant!  {.sit}

Thou hast written regarding the articles and papers which are written by the believers of God, and the forwarding them to this land for correction. This Servant, on account of the multitude of works and occupations, has no time whatever to attend to this matter. If these articles are read in the Spiritual Assembly (of each city in America) and the printing and, spreading of them is advised and approved by the Assembly, it is acceptable. This permission is granted that these souls do not become disappointed, and be engaged in the composition and printing of instructive papers. Chase will arrive here soon and we will discuss with him regarding this matter.  

Say to Mr. Remey, - if he writes any article and the spiritual Assembly of Washington do approve its circulation, its spreading will lead to good result.  

His honor, Aḥmad Yazdí has not displayed the slightest shortcoming and omission in forwarding the letters and papers to this land. Know ye this of a certainty. Some of the letters have been received but there has not yet been time to answer them; while on the other hand, some of them are lost in the mail. Whatever has been received, its answer depends upon time and opportunity.  

But concerning the articles: - these articles must be revised and corrected by those souls who know the history of the Cause. If they approve their circulation, undoubtedly it will lead to the rapid promotion of the Cause. For this Servant has no time whatsoever to revise these articles. Regarding the despatch of letters and their early acknowledgement, a new and complete system is organized. God willing, it will be perfected and put in execution.   

(Signed) ‘Abdu’l-Bahá-‘Abbás.  {.sig}

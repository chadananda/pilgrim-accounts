# Pilgrim Accounts
Consolidation of various public collections of pilgrim note accounts. This is an open collaborative project to add value to these historical narratives in the following ways:

1. Link each typed manuscript to one or more scanned originals
2. Sort out correct date and author for each
3. Upgrade readability of typed copy 
  * Standardize spellings of Arabic/Farsi terms
  * Sandardize formatting into simple Markdown with some extensions for page numbering etc.
  * Expand acronyms for TTS
  * Correct obvious typos in spelling and grammar

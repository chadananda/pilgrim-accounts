# Pilgrim Accounts
Consolidation of various public collections of pilgrim note accounts. This is an open collaborative project to add value to these historical narratives in the following ways:

1. Link each typed manuscript to one or more scanned originals
    1. This removes one extra layer of potential mistakes
    1. This allows volunteers to help edit and improve typed copy

2. Sort out correct date and author 
    1. Many notes have incorrect author and date or are extracts from other notes. 

3. Upgrade readability of typed copy 
    1. Standardize spellings of Arabic/Farsi terms
    1. Sandardize formatting into simple Markdown with some extensions for page numbering etc.
    1. Expand acronyms for TTS
    1. Correct obvious typos in spelling and grammar

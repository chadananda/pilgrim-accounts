Copy of Notes Miss Rosernberg on the reading of the will of ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ as given in a talk at the meeting of the London Spiritual Assembly. Feb. 2nd 1929 at the Home of Mrs. Romer 2 Sloane Terrace, Sloanne Square.  

Miss Rosernberg said that the will was left sealed up in a packet, and addressed in ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ’s own hand to Shonhi Effendi and nothing could be done until Shonghi Effendi came and opened the packet. A very solemn meeting was appointed for the reading of the will. There were old grey-headed men present, who had been in the Movement for many years and if there had been the slightest doubt of the authenticity of the Will, they would have known it. The whole document was in His own hand-writing. There were at least 200 people present at the reading of the will, and it was most impressive ceremony. Every time Shonghi Effendi’s name eas mentioned, the whole assembly arose and made obeisance.  

The original appointment of Shonghi Effendi was made, when he was only 9 and ‘ADU’L-BAHÁ was in great danger. The three parts of the Will have different dates. There was not the slightest question at the time as to the validity and the very oldest members there acknowledge It. They had the Will photographed. Miss Rosenberg examined the Will and could see that it was old as it was stained from the dampness, as it had been put in a strong box and buried.  

Monsieur Druyfus-Barney was there and he translated many things of ‘ADU’L-BAHÁ’s.  

A Persian believer who had been with ‘ADU’L-BAHÁ many years said, that he was sitting by the Master at one time, when he was writing a Tablet for this believer to take to ersia, and he began to think, how everything depended upon the Master and it came to his mind “Whom can we have to succeed him?” and ‘ADU’L-BAHÁ called aloud, Shonghi Effendi and he came running very quickly to the Master, and the Master said to Shonghi Effendi “Here is a friend who very much wishes to see you.”  

He said, that after ‘ADU’L-BAHÁ’s death he understood this incident. The reading of the Will was a most solemn affair. The Will is all in His own hand-writing. At the solemn gathering, no one of all the Persian believers assembled, questioned It.  

Copied in London, England from the Official Minute Book, February 20th 1931 by Annie B. Homer, Secretary London Bahá’í Assembly.

Dear Horace,  

The Colonial Office have taken the stronger stand we hoped for, so it does not seem wise to ask the convention for a very drastic resolution of criticism or condemnation. Results, though, are what we wish and we ___ yet foresee what this stronger position we produce in Ba<u>gh</u>dád, so I suggest that the convention be asked to adopt a resolution expressing its ___ disappointment at the unexpected delay in the settlement of the matter and winging the incoming National Spiritual Assembly to leave ___ within its power undone to ___ the British and ‘Iráq Governments to see that their property restored to the Bahá’í ___ the earliest date possible. You will know just how best to word the resolution.  

My idea is that this will be just as effective for use by the N.S.A. with the British and ‘Iráq people or for publicity later on, if it should become necessary, without embarrassing things at the moment where it seems as if the Colonial Office anyway is doing the right thing. The difficulty has been in Ba<u>gh</u>dád where, on the ___ line, is nearest be remembered what we want done is by no means easy, further complicated, too, by these delicate and important ___ with ___, which to then loom so much larger than our matter. I must confess, though, that here in London official’s attitude has been all we could ask and has gone too few in our own direction to doubt its sincerity. But the ___ is to get the ‘Iráq government to ___ against the largest and most influential group of its own citizen, the Jhiaks, who also beside over the State Religion, a bad combination to antagonize and a most difficult task. We must be patient. Please regard this information as confidential to the N.S.A. It should not be allowed to get beyond them until the flaw is well going, with the ‘Iráq government started, or else has foiled. I’ll keep you advised, but it will be slow. Ba<u>gh</u>dád is a long way off.  

I have written Shoghi Effendi of this suggestion to you and said that I would ask you to do nothing about it unless he cables you his approval of the ___ resolution.  

As you see, all this can mean quite a stay over here for us if Shoghi Effendi should wish it. At his direct cabled instruction. I am here now, and this immediate work will ¬¬¬__ me beyond the date of the convention, as I feared would be the case when I last wrote. With all this uncertainty and the used of having members of the N.S.A who can be ___ at meetings and vote if my name should come up for election, will you kindly explain and have it withdrawn?  

And because give my dearest love to all the members of the N.S.A. be sure I freely know my lost in having missed this year of fellowship with you all as you have gone onward and upward together in your devoted service.  

And, if you think it all right, please give my love to all the friends at the Convention and tell them how closely my heart beats with them as they are gathered there together, in gratitude for the blessed privilege of being there, in joy and ___ in all our N.S.A has done for the Cause this year, and in humbly praying for His blessing in our efforts through the coming year before us.  

As ever, In His service, Mountfort.

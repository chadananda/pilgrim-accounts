##  Mrs. Sara G. Herron’s Notes 
###  Dec. 1900 

The Infinite Essence, so He was with God in the beginning, when the sun has risen, its light shines upon the earth, but before its rising, when the light is not perceived, it is still a sun with the quality of light in it. The rays from the sun are with the sun, and were with the sun before it shone upon the earth, so in the same sense they were with the sun in the beginning and in reality are the sun. Christ was with the Infinite Essence in the beginning and so He was God.

Once, some materialists came to ‘Akká to ask ‘Abbás Effendi what about the Immaculate Conception. He answered: <q class="">“A living body cannot come forth from a dead body. Only a living man can make a living child; this is a scientific fact.”</q>   

The scholars said it is impossible for a child to be born without a father, and said nothing could change their opinion regarding it. They left the subject and began speaking of geology — scientific facts well known. They were glad to speak of their idea of evolution of man from the atom and molecule all through the different stations until at last man was evolved from all these previous conditions. Then ‘Abbás Effendi said: <q class="">“Well, did the first man who was evolved have a father and mother, as you said a child must have that comes into this world?”</q> They said: <q class="">“Why no, of course not.”</q> Then the Master said: <q class="">“Well, if God could make the first man who came upon the earth without a father or mother, could not make Jesus Christ also without a human father”</q> They were confounded and said nothing more, but after that they were converted and went away believers.

Look at the favors of the Blessed Perfection in bringing together these people from different parts of the world to sit down at a table in Haifa, at the foot of Mt. Carmel. It is almost impossible for the people.

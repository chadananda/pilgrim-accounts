My Dear Mr. Lunt,  

It is a great experience to go to Haifa, and one changes one’s point of View on many matters. The Guardian is an example of now intellect can serve the spirit in a manner we of the West have never known. ‘There is nothing emotional about the Guardian; he is a perfectly controlled and mature personality. I have never heard him recite an incident in which he was the major figure or say anything which would in any way give him a chance to steel. This may sound very naive but the point is that Shoghi Effendi simply refutes all those theories with which our academies are surfeited; that every ego is trying merely to maximize itself.  

Shoghi Effendi is very impersonal end he speaks only of the Word and of Faith. His speech is rapid and his English is stunning; when he speaks, the hours pass tirelessly. I should say that his most obvious characteristic is Power, but there is nothing arbitrary or even personal about it. Again and again he seems to convey to one that the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh will reach its aim and that we have only to be superlatively faithful and to be active and obedient. There is something about him that makes one believes that one can do anything if he requires it; for example, he told me to write, and somehow I simply must begin to do it.  

Shoghi Effendi says that great world events will establish the Faith. It depends only partly upon the Bahá1’s. The war is inevitable and great changes will result there from. Greet Britain will lose her colonies. At present, the British Commonwealth is the greatest obstacle to the Commonwealth of Bahá’u’lláh. Russia will experience a change in regime. From America much can be expected. The form of the Administration established in America will become the form for the entire world. Also Germany has a great destiny. In an era of persecution they will exhibit a loyalty and devotion which makes than comparable to the Persians. Scholars, teachers and technicians from Germany will contribute much to the Bahá’í Cycle.   

Isn’t this fascinating?

MY DEAR BROTHER IN THE CAUSE OF EL ABHÁ:  {.greet}

Since I have had the great honor and privilege of being received in the home of The Master I endeavor to fulﬁll your request to write a few words to describe to a few believers in Washington some of the experiences during these few days in the Home of Peace.  

Outside the sea. is raging and the wind howling, which it has done since we came – and it is as if this were to show us the perfect contrast of Serenity and Gentleness in the spiritual atmosphere of The Master’s Home.  

Our Beloved Master holds in this home an absolute reign of Love and Peace, and those who visit here can but realize more and more that they must help in sending out over the different countries to which they return the rays of that love, kindness and courtesy.  

I, myself, felt so much awe when ﬁrst entering his presence that I was unable to ask the many things which I had intended; but the questions in my mind have been answered by him in his talks to us all together without my having asked them. This has been the experience of many beside myself. His explanation and knowledge seem to ﬂow endlessly as water from a fountain, and if one leaves ‘Akká with one spiritual hunger and thirst unsatisﬁed it will be from the unworthiness of one’s own soul to receive and not from any limitation of his power of explanation or enlightenment.  

I would wish all pilgrims who come here to look for Divine virtue and example and not for any supernatural experiences or astonishing visible signs, and to remember that in looking for the extraordinary or supernatural, the clouds of the human body will most surely veil such from their sight and prevent their eyes from being opened to the true essence of the Light and Teaching which is to last into the far future, whereas the presence and form visible to our eyes will be taken from us.  

Among the several talks which The Master gave us in the ﬁve days of our visit, I will close with the one he gave yesterday on the subject of the opposition and rejection of the Prophets.  

Moses prophecied and taught the people Truths which they scorned and rejected, whereas it was His Truth which lasted and was fulﬁlled and their words which were proven false and worthless. In the time of Jesus Christ, His Words were fulﬁlled and are now honored, and the words and thoughts of those who mocked have been exposed and judged. Thus it is in the Days of Bahá‘u’lláh, and the opposition of those who now scorn and reject will be proved worthless and His Word honored throughout the ages.  

There are ladies from Ashkabad (Russia) here who have taken a journey of 22 days to come. One lives in Ashkabad, in a room belonging to the New Temple, and serves the believers who come to visit.

### Haifa, March 6.—

Looking from here on that beautiful view of ‘Akká in the dim distance, we, who can enjoy the beauties of Mount Carmel and all the beautiful scenery on our journey home and have the good things of the world and freedom to use them, may well realize and remember that The Beloved Master who with kindness and limitless love receives one in his home, is a prisoner and exile for the sake of the Great Teaching and Truth he has come to bring to the world and has not passed through the gates of ‘Akká for three years, though he has come to bring the true Freedom to all Nations.

I am very sorry that I can express in so poor a way my impression of this wonderful week spent with the Holy Household whose kindness has been perfectly limitless.  

I am your sister gratefully, in the Holy Cause, {.sig}

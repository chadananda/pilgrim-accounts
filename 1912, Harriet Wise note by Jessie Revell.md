### Taken in New York City, July 9th to 21st, 1912.

Mrs. Goodall, Mrs. Ooper and Miss Wise reached New York on the evening of July 9th. After bath and dinner at the Hotel, they went to call on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to 309 West 78th St.  

“As we stepped from the taxicab, there sat ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on the steps of the house, as if waiting to welcome us.”  

“Very welcome! Very welcome! It is good that you have come.”  

“The prayer of my heart now is that, when the veil will be parted for me to step over to the other side, I shall hear His Heavenly Voice say, ‘Very welcome! Very welcome! It is good that you have come.’”  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked Mrs. Goodall to come and sit beside Him. “These are old friends and firm ones. These will be aided because they are firm and steadfast, and holding to the Covenant of GOD.”  

Was told the California friends were in great unity and harmony.  

“In reality, this is the cause of my happiness. In reality, the friends in California are very warm. I have felt it. Whenever the name of is mentioned, I am made happy. I am well pleased with the people of, California, especially the friends of GOD.”  

Mrs. Goodall said cone wished she might have brought all the friends in California.  

“They are here. You did bring them. You are here and that is sufficient. I am made happy by your coming. It is a great thing for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to be made happy. I am not always made happy. It is because Mrs. Goodall’s heart is so pure. Your hearts are so pure.”  

Message to the friends in Pasadena: “Although I am not present in your meeting, yet I have the utmost love for you in heart and soul, for you have heard the Divine Call and became exhilarated and happy. You became ignited through the love of Bahá’u’lláh and, like unto the meadows of GOD, you have become fresh and verdant through the down-pouring of the rain. Therefore I am very pleased with you, and for you I beg the protection and the providence of the Most Great Name.”  

I replied that it would brighten the eyes and gladden the hearts of the friends.  

“Tell Mrs. Duncan to turn her face towards GOD. GOD is the Provider. A soul must not put his trust in his art or profession, but rather rely upon GOD. She must be entirely fearless and confident of her future.”  

Message to a lady in Pasadena who is an ardent Socialist: “Tell Mrs. D. there are only two ways of correcting the social conditions: it cannot be done by force. One is changing the hearts of the people, so that hose w have great wealth will give freely and gladly. The other is by executing new and just laws which will not regulate all the economic conditions, so that there will not be the extremes, the very rich nor the very poor. For instance, go back to the foundation work, agriculture. Take a town of 100 people. If one man is only able to produce 100 bushels of grain and his family expenses arc balanced by that, he gives nothing to the common treasury. But if his expenses are only 90 bushels, he gives a certain proportion. Another examples if he has 39 sheep, he gives nothing, but if he has 40 sheep, he must give one. If has has 80 sheep or 200, he gives on increasing ratio. The 1/19 of the net income is for religious work.”  

19 day Prayer - how to use it: “This prayer is to beg GOD for our needs. Any need which is according to Divine Wisdom, GOD will answer. But a need which is not according to wisdom, the Mercy of GOD, through Compassion, would deny the answer, because it was not good for his soul. Then the prayer will not be answered. For examples when praying for money, money may become his heedlessness, then it will not be granted.”  

“Today whoever arises to serve the Kingdom, that soul is the holiest of all the people.”  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá told Miss Buckton not to tamper with the forces in this world. It hampers and retards the condition of the both in thin world and especially the world to come, These forces are real, but not to be active on this plane. He likened it to the Child in the matrix. It has eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc, but these powers are not in activity, not to be used in the matrix world. The Whole purpose of the matrix life in the coming forth into this world, so the whole purpose of this life is the coming forth into the world of reality, when all these forces will then be in their proper sphere for activity. They belong to that world.  

“Kheiralla has been spreading false rumors; he has become like Satan. He is not important enough to be mentioned. Such souls are of no importance, not even armies of such people.”

### Talk at Mrs. Krug’s, July 10th.

“It is a blessed meeting; you are blessed. Blessed souls are gathered hero. In reality, this house is illumined. The Supreme Concourse is descending. Today the hosts of the Supreme Concourse have assembled like unto armies made ready and they are waiting to see who will enter into the battle-field. Everyone whose heart is sincere and faithful will be assisted with the utmost power. Everyone who enters into the great arena will be assisted, and know this for a certainty. Here I am in Mrs. Krug’s home, have left the great prison and am allowed to raise my voice in churches and public places, and no one has opposed it, This is extraordinary. No one can think how wonderful it is. It is by the Confirmation of the Spirit. Think of an Oriental permitted to speak with utmost power in the churches and his speech against the established doctrines, and allowed to demonstrate the validity of Bahá’u’lláh, the validity Muḥammad, in the canter of the churches and no opposition! THIS IS A MIRACLE. AN EXTRAORDINARY MIRACLE!”

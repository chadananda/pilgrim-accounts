Part I Brightening Horizons of Israel
 
Part II Our Guardian Speaks
 
Part III Afterglow of Haifa  

The following are notes of table conversations given by the Beloved Guardian in the presence of Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum and the members of the International Council who heard them all. Most of these Notes were given when Ruth Moffett was the only remaining pilgrim. The notes are not verbatim and not in sequence but verified by Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum and members of the International Council at the table after the departure of the Guardian, and checked each night until midnight by Jessie Revell from her stenographic notes to be sure that the content be correct, and expressed as accurately as possible in the words of the Beloved Guardian.  

Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum wrote that if the friends could realize the selfless devotion, justice and loving forbearance of the Guardian, “They would love Him with a consuming, weaping tenderness and devotion tenderness and devotion, as indeed so many of them do. He is so golden-hearted, so pure-hearted, that sometimes when I catch a glimpse of it, I am stunned” As was this pilgrims.  

Now that our Beloved Guardian has gone to his great reward in the Abhá Kingdom, every word of his is more important and precious than ever and should be so soul stirring that we rise and spread the great, glad message of Bahá’u’lláh as one soul in many bodies.  

Our Guardian Shoghi Effendi had, on Ruth Moffett’s first visit, asked the Greatest Holy Leaf, the only daughter of Bahá’u’lláh for the spiritual names of Ruth and Robert Moffett. She said, “For Ruth, Rúḥíyyih, which means spiritual beauty.” And the name of Robert is Ḥabíbu’lláh, which means “beloved”. Then the Guardian said it is good to use these spiritual names as much as possible as it puts that spirit out into the others.  

### Part II A. OUR GUARDIAN SHOGHI EFFENDI, SPEAKS

The Guardian greeted Ruth with unusual warmth and the first night, placed her at the head of the table, which is a courtesy given to each incoming pilgrim. As he did so, he said, “Welcome, it has been a long time that we have looked for your return to Haifa. You will find things much changed from the time that you were here before. Did you see the Shrine of the Báb. I hope you can go there tomorrow. How are the friends in America? How is the Assembly in Chicago functioning now? What progress is there now? I hope that all friends in America are progressing.”

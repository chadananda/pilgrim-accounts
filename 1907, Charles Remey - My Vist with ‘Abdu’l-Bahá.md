Dear Bahá’í Friend:   {.greet}

Since attaining to the visit of the “Master” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, now one month ago, I have had it in my heart to write to the Believers in America but because of the unrest of travel and of meeting people this is the first moment when conditions have been favorable to letter writing.   

After some delays and trials of travel Mr. Phelps and I reached Acre on July 12th. We had arrived at Haifa on the previous day where we received word to go over to Acre for the day. Some trouble had recently manifested itself on the part of the Government authorities, so probably this was the reason that we did not remain over night in Acre. During that days visit we met the Master several times, and delivered to him the letters and messages which we brought, from the friends on the other side of the water. I was permitted to mention your name to him, together with those of some other friends and he said — <q class="abd">“Give my love and Greeting to each of these”</q>.	To the Believers in general our Lord sent his love and glad tidings of Joy and Peace, saying that it was through joy and love and peace, that the followers of the Blessed Perfection must meet and overcome the world. The more people oppose us, the more gentle, long suffering and loving we should be towards them. Between the Believers themselves, nothing but the most perfect accord, union and love should exist. They should sacrifice themselves for one another. This is conducive to unity and steadfastness which are the foundation of the well being of the Holy Cause.   

The Master also wished me to tell the Believers how impossible it is for him to answer each letter sent to him, or even to answer one in ten, so great are the demands upon his time. He said that the Friends were always in his prayers and thoughts and that in spirit he was with them always.   

Although we were with the Master but a few brief hours, our souls were rejoiced and filled to overflowing with that love which he alone can impart.

In this day the greatest {{p2}} blessing and bounty of God, is to realize the exalted station of Our Lord ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Exalted through his humility, servitude and daily martyrdom in the Path of God.   

He alone is making the way of the Kingdom possible to us. Without him as our leader we would indeed be lost. Let us loose no time in offering ourselves, our likes and dislikes and our all in his path.   

This Cause will only flourish through its followers giving themselves heart and soul in the Holy Work. If we fail God will raise up others to do His Work, so let our united prayer be to stand united and steadfast in His Service.   

On the second day after our first visit to the Holy City we again spent a few hours in the Masters house, and then with no desire in our hearts save that of going back into our fields of work we left His Presence.   

On returning to Haifa Mr. Phelps sailed immediately for Port Sa‘íd and America, while two days later I sailed for Beirut from whence I came to Paris, and will later visit London in accord with the Master’s instructions. God willing I will return to America the latter part of September.   

On leaving Acre after our first visit we stopped to worship at the Holy Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh. You have heard our pilgrims speak of worshiping at this Holy spot. It is an experience which finds no expression in words. While worshiping I made a supplication for you the blessing of which I already feel in myself, in that thereby we have been brought nearer together.   

Greetings in the Holy Name. {.sig}

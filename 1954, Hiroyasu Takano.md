The Pacific area is most important for the Bahá’í world, as well as the African continent.  There are two centers in this area - Japan and Australia. This may be explained in two different ways. First: They are like magnetic poles. Japan must work as the northern pole of the North Pacific Ocean. Japan is not only the North Pole, but she must be a light to shine in the North Pacific Ocean. She has the duty of serving the North Pacific Ocean as well as the Soviet Union upon which Japan in the East, Germany in the West America in the North and India and Persia in the South must function as the sources of light. In the ten year plan, Japan is the only country north of the Pacific Ocean to have a N.S.A. This matter is fundamentally important in building up the International House of Justice. We do not require China and the Philippine Islands to have N. S. A’s.  

### What should Japan Do?

Japan must have preparation in order to work as a center. She must become firm in the Cause to do her duty as a magnetic pole and source of light.  

For that purpose she must concentrate on establishing the N.S.A. For this Purpose it is necessary to have isolated centers. These isolated centers are like points which will make letters, and these letters will make words, and words will make sentences. In this way isolated centers will become local groups which will soon grow to L. S. A.’s. In order to attain this it will be necessary to have many isolated centers. Especially in Japan it is necessary that the members in large cities disperse to neighboring cities; for instance from Tokyo to Yokohama.......I believe now is the time for the Tokyo Bahá’ís to begin to disperse. The principle cities must have Bahá’í Halls as center of administration, worship and spirituality. The center of worship must be- come a House of worship. (From Mr.Takano: “Our beloved Guardian told me that since Mt. Fuji is the holy mountain in Japan, it would be nice if we could have a Temple there in the near future.”)  

The meaning of establishing the N.S.A. in Japan, as you understand from my words is to work letters for sentences at first, and then to function as centers of the principal districts, The N. S. A’s are now twelve and in the future it will be necessary to have at least sixty before the House of Justice will be established. Japan must not be content only to establish a N. S. A.  

In order to spread the teachings we must avoid being like jelly, but must be like mercury in that we must offer ourselves not only by money.  

Duty of Tokyo. The center of the development of the Faith is Tokyo. By this time it is also the center of the Bahá’í Faith. The L. S. A’s in other cities must consider the Tokyo L.S.A. as t N. S.A. and Tokyo should take the responsibility of developing the Bahá’í Faith in Japan. In order to attain this responsibility, the Tokyo L. S. A. should have a committee for translation and for spreading the teachings (afterwards pioneers), am educate. The spreading of the Bahá’í teachings should not be done through words, but through action and character. It is necessary for us to be spiritual, emptying ourselves and following the teachings of the prophets which have come from God, realizing according to our ability the divinity by which people will be attracted. Translations should be made of gleanings; some answered questions Iqaan. Important part must be learned by heart. Tokyo should prepare for National Hall, because it is so important for the Bahá’ís that they had Bahá’í Halls when they are persecuted. All Bahá’í should have opportunity to participate with the National Bahá’í Hall in Tokyo. Cooperate especially with Australia and also with Germany, America, India and Írán. Japan and the Japanese people are qualified to make this cooperation. The Japanese are diligent and capable and spiritual like the Germans, and moreover they have a balance in their hearts. They have ability as shown by the modern progress. They have already had experience in organizing things. Japan is the only country that has experienced the atom bombing. That was their sacrifice.  It is wonderful what the Japanese Bahá’ís have accomplished these past two years and this proves the fact of what I have said.  

### Conclusion

The Japanese Bahá’ís should be very careful in organizing, because organization is a very important thing to spread the teachings. They must not make haste in spreading the teachings. For example, if they should select any member, you must choose the one who is of good characters in haste, then they will interrupt the development of the faith in Japan. These words are spoken to the Japanese themselves, but not to the foreigners in Japan and this must be understood. That is, the Japanese should have responsibility and self government. Japan should send pioneers to islands of the Pacific Ocean, Formosa, Manchuria, Mongolia and Sakhlim, etc.

It will be quite an achievement when the Faith is recognized in Catholic Spain. I am looking forward to the day when it is legalized.   

We should store literature in Switzerland until things are settled in Spain. In other words, don’t put your eggs all in one basket.   

We must be very careful in any correspondence either in Spain or going in or out of Spain.   

We have two great enemies, Catholicism and communism. I wouldn’t be surprised if communism fought the Pope to the weakening of both. It is like in modern warfare-there is no victor; both sides are weakened.   

Spain should send people to Rio de Oro and Spanish Sahara. The Persians have tried to enter and cannot, but the spaniards can do so easily.   

The friends on the islands should correspond with neighbors (like Canaries with Spain) to strengthen bonds with the [Bahá’í] world.   

There will soon be oceanic conferences in preparation for the world conference; i.e. after the African conferences, the islands will have conferences. The islands of the Mediterranean may meet in Cyprus in the Atlantic it may be at Madeira.   

Later each island will be allocated to a LSA.   

The Canaries are now under Africa but later will be Spain this is because Spain is now weak and Africa is strong.   

The legalization in Spain will be a GREAT victory. We have our difficulties and we have our victories; first the seizure of records and the jailing of the [Bahá’ís], then the investigation then; then the legalization, then the victory.   

[Shoghi Effendi] wants a picture of Las Palmas and Santa Cruz assemblies for Mansion of [Bahá’u’lláh].   

Persians must learn administration from the Americans. The Americans know how to administer. The Persians will not face problems.   

The Persians will understand the Spanish; they are alike in many respects.   

Pioneers must not move on until LSA is FIRMLY established (15 in one place, and more than 9 active)   

Deep in the heart of every soul is a longing to know his God and to draw ever nearer to Him. In the House of Worship in Wilmette during the dedication, one had a slight implication of the feeling of the spiritual fragraces which supasses all space and time-it is as if one is suspended in one moment of eternity, and one wishes to stay there forever.   

When the pilgrim first enters the Shrine of the Báb and kneels before that sacred Threshold, there seems to rush upon him such a force from the Supreme Concourse that he can neither withold his tears nor restrain his emotions. Coming from the outside world to that sacred Spot, he immediatly senses the divine beauty, the perfecton, the all-embracing tenderness of the Báb, and the vastness of spiritual love that was showered upon the earth at His coming. As he touches his forehead to the threshold, he feels that at last he has come home, that no matter what his achievements or failures, God will accept him as he is and guide him along the pathway.   

Here, in the “heart of Mt. Carmel” one senses so well that it is the spiritual heart of the world, and from this center anew has throbbed the inspired Words of a Prophet of God. Here one feels the majesty, the peace, the tranquility that the whole world is seeking, and one sees the beautiful gardens being readied for the day when the rulers of mankind will mount the terraced stairs to pay their respects to the Prophet of God.   

The Guardian spoke of the arrangement of the gardens and buildings on Mt. Carmel that first night saying that both in Bahjí and in Mt. Carmel there were the outer gardens, then the inner gardens or Holy Precincts, and then the Holy of Holies where lies the remains of the Prophet. The gardens in Bahjí, he said, were started by Adbul-Bahá who brought many plants from Haifa. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and a number of pilgrims carried the flowers in their robes, and pots of water on their heads, from Haifa to the gates of ‘Akká. They camped there overnight and in the early dawn, lighted their lanterns and chanting as they went, carried the flowers into ‘Akká.   

At the present time, the Rivan feast is held in the outer gardens, following which the believers progress to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. In the future, because of respect, the feast will be held at an even greater distance from the Shrine itself.   

The Guardian asked if we had noticed that there is not one single bench in the gardens of the Shrine of the Báb. “It is a place of worship, not recreation,” he said. “If there were benches, the people would bring their lunch and leave litter. There would be litter around the benches, under the benches and on the benches. Even now we have difficulty keeping the ice cream vendor away from the garden entrence. We must be firm about this and prevent his entry.”   

The Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh to be erected in ‘Akká will be more ornate then that of the Báb, it will have columns of yellow marble to match the bricks; it will have ballustrades and urns, and something else. It must be very ornate.   

The endowments in Israel now are valued at $4,000,000.00 (4 million) and it is the only religion (Christian, Jewish, Moslem) which is allowed to have its properties tax exempt. This is because we do not sell or rent the property, and we give the produce to the poor. I.E. the others built houses and rent them, or rent out the property. We make olive oil from the olives, save a part for household use, give a portion to the workers for their labor, and give the rest to the poor.   

The International Endowments in the 10-year plan were taken care of at one blow (49 thousand dollars), enabling the believers to purchase the ground for Hazratu’l-Quds listed in the 10-year plan.   

In Persia they are now working on a 5-year plan to build their Temple. This Temple will be more elaborate than the one in Wilmette, but this will be easy especially since the dome is to be of gold like that of the Shrine of the Báb. This was a diplomatic move. The Temple in Germany will be more difficult to erect and money must come from outside. Also the believers in Germany have invited non-Bahá’í architects to submit plans.   

* line missing   

ground for the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds was nearly done. 108 of the 131 virgin territories are settled, and only 7 islands remain (one of which is Spitzbergen) the remaining territories being mostly behind the Iron Curtain. There is now the in Sikim a believer waiting to go to Tibet. Now we need to build the administration and do the teaching. The most difficult work is the work of teaching. In the U.S.by the end of the 10-years, the assemblies should number not 171 but 300. The Persian believers all want to converge on Ṭihrán and I am trying to get them to disperse. In Persia in Ṭihrán there are over 50,000 and if only one — tenth of them will disperse, the job of teaching would be all over. If the believers will disperse and ACTIVELY teach the receptive souls, it will be easy. The number of LSA’s all over should be doubled.   

The Guardian said he hoped the government will not prevent the building of the Temple in Persia. He said that it would be a miracle if the world congress can be held in Ba<u>gh</u>dád in 1963 because the <u>Sh</u>í’ahs oppose us there. Already they have seized the house of Bahá’u’lláh and the government wants to build a hospital on the spot of the Garden of Rivan. As they are enemies to the Cause there is no use protesting because this would make them more determined. This is one of the things that distresses the Guardian. “But,” he said, “we have problems and we have victories.”   

Teaching is the most difficult of all the things to be accomplished in the 10 year plan; but if the believers will disperse and teach, it will be easy. Teaching and the formation of Bahá’í courts will be difficult.   

Of the 49 Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds, 21 are now purchased and 28 will be purchased during the next Bahá’í year.   

The building on Mt. Carmel will be in the form of an arc. It is both the ark spoken of in the Bible, and the spiritual arc. In the Western part of the mountain, at the head, will be the Temple, and on the East, the administrative buildings: the Archives, the Seat of the Hands of the Cause, the Seat of the House of Justice, the Seat of the Guardianship, and other buildings to come later.   

This is just the beginning. The friends do not realize how great and extensive it is. It is the first time in the history of the world that there has been a spiritual crusade on world lines. There has been political crusades, but never a world spiritual crusade. Following the 10-year plan there will be other crusades on and on not only through the formative age but also into the golden age.   

The work territorially (expansion to virgin areas), administratively, spiritually and legally and financially are all progressing splendidly. But the work on teaching and the Bahá’í courts are not.   

The embellishing of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh will be even more beautiful than that of the Báb. This goes on AFTER the 10-year plan. We are doing preliminary work now only. Mr. Romey has made a few drawings but this is not enough. Temple land not purchased include: Columbo, Rome, Stockholm, Jakarta.   

The Guardian told the pilgrims before us that there was now only one line between the US and Russia and that things may happen at any moment. That all large centers of materialism are in danger from not only the East and the West but also from the North. After the suffering in the US it will lead and bring about the birth of a new civilization, and help to establish the Faith. The US will be the leaders.   

Reguarding the Temple Plan in Persia, the Guardian wanted the pinnicles to follow more the lines of those in Westminister in London.   

As some of the pilgrims related comments of visiter to the Shrine on the Báb, the Guardian said, “Those who are unothodox appreciate it the orthodox don’t like it.” Of the children who came to the Shrine he said, “Children are innocent and have good hearts. We have friends and we also have enemies. Now we are adding another building which will add to their jealousy.”   

The Bahá’ís revere the holy sites of all religions; we are not narrow-minded. We should visit Nazaret, Tiberias and Jerusalem.   

The Jewish Bahá’ís have done very well lately in both the East and the West.   

Jackarta is to have a NSA and will be the most important center in S.E. Asia. We have? [Bahá’ís] in Saigon, Soloman Is, 2 in Malaya, [Bahá’í] literature in Vietnamese, Indonesian, Burmese. “The friends are not content in the number of languages listed in the 10-year plan,” said the Guardian, “They have translated the Teachings into 24 supplimentary languages.   

Siezure of literature and jailing of believers ends in a victory. It started with disterbances and ends in victory for the Faith. We have a plan and all the [Bahá’ís] know it. Our plan is clear cut and definate. God has His Plan, which is mysterious and works in a disorderly way. They are complementary processes, but have the same end.   

One should visit Nazareth, Jerusalem, Tiberias, Bethlahem — four places associated with the life of Christ.   

The Persian government has helped Persians come on pilgramage inspite of the fact that they are not friendly with us.   

Johannesburg is the most un-Bahá’í city in the world because it is impossable for the races to meet together. The job of pioneers is to teach the negroes, establish the center, and move on. Bahá’ís should be constantly on the move. They should inspire their new believer to arise and teach in their turn; not just be dead believers. This is necessary if pioneers are to achieve their purpose.   

The Guardian said, “We are now establishing the Administrative center on Mt. Carmel. We have already established the spiritual center.” We have more than 50 acres on Mt. Carmel. The nine terraces below the Shrine and the 9 to be built above the Shrine will be named for the 18 Letters of the Living.   

The four NSAs to be formed in Africa will be four more pillars in the Universal House of Justice. (Cairo, Tunis, Kampala, Johannesburg). Johannesburg was chosen because it is the second largest city.   

The Guardian said that he would announce the 13 pillars more to be formed, in the Rivan message which he is now composing.   

Reguarding Americans he said: “Tell them to pay attention to my repeated messages. Tell them to disperse — the farther the better and the longer the better. They should not just stay a few years like tourists but settle and make their homes abroad. They should not plan to return to the States.   

In teaching, one should make a wide association of friend and search (like in the Valley of Search) for receptive souls. Look for the sincere regardless of class, those with sincere hearts and purity of motive. Be discriminating. Then concentrate on the few and teach them thoroughly. Bring them into the Faith and instill in them the desire to promote the Faith. This is the slow way but the sure way. It is the good foundation. Artificial LSA’s are not successful.   

The Spanish are warm-hearted. The Spanish temperment and American temperment are quite different. But in Africa where the American Bahá’ís went they have already changed to be more like the Africans. The same can be true with the Americans in Spanish territories.   

One must have moderation in all things. There should be a regional NSA of Spain and Portugal until it can be divided into two NSA’s because thesy are not strong enough This is only a provisional measure.   

It used to be hard to find the Bahá’ís. Now it is difficult to find a place where there are no [& Bahá’ís]. The Guardian said that his records are out-of-date from one day to another because things are changing so fast.   

He said not to take literally the suggestion of reading 5-10 non-Bahá’í books to I Bahá’í book: that we should read to deepen and to widen. To deepen with the Bahá’í writings, to widen-with other books. For deepening use DAILY Dawn-Breakers, God Passes By and Some Answered Questons. Prayer, meditaion, study and Action= Read history etc. to comare the times   

But the most important thing is to TEACH. Cook islands reports its first native believer. First native in Cyprus is ready to come in.   

Establish LSA then bring in natives; establish administration as a tool thru’ which to wrk. Choose people of good character and good heart to avoid problems in the community. Natives must have preference. The Spaniards are sensitive. The Persians would understand them. (R.K. said example of her mother’s great love can comsume all disagreement.   

Japan & Austrailia are the two of focal points of the Pacific. In expansion (territorial plan) the believers did in 1 year what they should have done in 10 yrs.   

This is the first spiritual crusade on the world basis. This is ony the beginnig. There woere political crusades etc. but never spiritual crusades on this basis. There will be other crusades going the through the formative age and golden age.   

Hainan Island is important. Bahá’ís must leave their homes FOREVER and settle elseweres.   

All kings must go.   

The pioneer is in the forefront until the LSA is firmly established, then the pioneer is in the background. Better still he must go elsewhere and form another LSA. This is doubly meritorious.   

Establish NSA’s then Bahá’í goverment... but do not speak of this, especially in [&AF] right now. We can talk abot this in England because they won’t believe us.   

Guardian will advise us, such as things of the Faith. But on secondary things such as buying land and building etc. he never advises.   

“The friends did in 1 year what they were to do in 10 years.” “They would have, too, if you had let them”, R.K. said to the Guardian.   

The negroes have broken all records.   

For 10 years there were no pilgrims to Haifa.   

Seek the pure of heart and good character. Don’t be in a hurry to get the in. Make a wide acquaintance. Sort out a few and concentrate on the receptive ones. Try to et all classes represented.   

Believers in the large cities will be evaporated if they don’t move. People in the villages are more receptive.   

Africa leads. It is the only continent where all territories And islands were opened — 55 territories and 12 islands.   

“I am glad I don’t have to pronunce on the atom or space ships. Thank goodness there is notheing in the Writings about this.   

Temple site on it. Carmel overlooks spot where Bahá’u’lláh pitched tent and revealed Tablet of Carmel.   

America leads becouse it has 1) Temple and has started dependency. Then comes 2) ‘I<u>sh</u>qabád which has the Temple then 3) Persia & Germany which have purchased land and are starting plans and 4) Mr. Carmel which is now in the process of being purchased.   

Olive trees around Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh are very old; some go back to the time of Christ. Some will be left & some removed for the work of enlarging gardens.   

Gold on pinacles of Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh to be carried down to give effect that the gold comes from dome to permeate building.   

“I have many things to do, little things, big things, all kinds of things, and am exhausted... but good news revives me.”   

Some expert must be found in Israel to study authentically the races in the Faith. We have 30 now and maybe 15 more.   

5 years ago there was no negro Bahá’ís in America. Now there are more than 1,000 in 230 localities, in 52 territories and speaking 40 languages.   

One woman who came to visit the Shrine said, “It is so beautiful it makes me weep.”   

One man said, “It is the most beautiful thing in the holy land. In fact, is the most beautiful thing in the whole world.” (some kind of architect)-went up on foot to see it... his wife and he having viewed it from the sea as they docked.   

One man said, “My wife and I came to the Holy Land to see the Holy Places. But after being here 3 weeks I am less a Christian than I was before. This is the first ray of hope I have seen since coming here and it is so marvelous I want to bring my wife. She didn’t come because she thought it was just another one of those dull tombs and she was tired and stayed in the hotel this morning.”

A lady from one of the Scandinavian country has gone to Spirtzenberg and one of the islands is a leper colony and the other a penal institution. The Guardian says the Soviet countries will be open before too long.   

The L.S.A. are the foundation of the New World Order, the N.S.As are the pillars and the International House of Justice will be the dome. Everything is representative of an institution, and we can not put the dome on until the foundation is strong enough to support it. So it is up to the Assemblies to become strong.   

Blood will run in the streets of America from Racial prejudice. He says the Bahá’ís have failed on this subject. We said that we were having some racial trouble here now and he said “YES”, but it will get worse.   

The Western Pilgrim House can accommodate 5 Pilgrims at a time, the Eastern House 8 and the Pilgrimage lasts 9 nights. You strain so hard when the Guardian is speaking, trying to get every word and remember it until you can jot it down in notes, that it tires you out. You can’t possibly remember all the figures and statistics as they seem to roll from his lips like water rom a fountain.   

He says the Jews are expecting the return of Elijah but you cannot tell them now that He has returned in the Báb. Their destiny is to return to their homeland. They are natural administrators and when they see the Bahá’í Faith they will be the upholders of the administrative Order.   

Freddie Schofflager and Msi Banání were the only two hands of the cause who received their appointment face to face with Shoghi Effendi. All the others received their appointment by mail, except Rúḥíyih <u>Kh</u>ánun, and she said the Guardian had to tell her because she was right there, The first Hands of the Cause were appointed by Bahá’u’lláh.   

No one knows who’s names are on the Pilgrim list. The Guardian attends to that personally and very often the friends do not know who is coming until they arrive. We were told that he has over 500 persians waiting to be called.   

Occasionally some one asks about some of the mystical questions. He does not answer only when he has the exact writings in front of him. He says that he is not the Guardian of the Mysteries but of the Administration, and if we cannot understand that, how could we understand the mysteries. No doubt a future Guardian will answer these questions.   

He had just received two cartoons from Bill Sears in Africa and he was much amused by them. Rúḥíyyih told the stories at lunch. Two Bahá’í’s who had pioneered to a desert island, both very bedraggled under their one lone palm tree, with their feet hanging in the water. A bottle comes floating by and as one grabbed at it, the other very anxiously said, “What does it say?” On reading it they found it said “Stick to your posts.”   

Also two Bahá’ís walking down the street in a middle eastern town when they saw a skull hanging from the eaves one of the shops, said one to the other I told you Sam didn’t know enough about Administration. The Guardian had a wonderful sense of humor, and it probably provided a chuckle in his very busy life.   

On our next afternoon dr. Nakin (caretaker at the Shrine and Eastern Pilgrim house took the 3 Western Pilgrims thru the Archives. It takes about 3 hours and they have so many precious relics. All of ;the writings of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The writings have all been illuminated which makes them very beautiful and they are all in beautiful frames.   

In the afternoon when there are Persian believers there, Ruhuyyih <u>Kh</u>ánun has tea for the ladies at 4, and Shoghi Effendi goes to the Shrine to be with the Persian man. While at tea you talk very informally about most anything and if there is any work to be done you help with that. My first day we all cleaned little berries, very much like our currants, which they use in making pillau, some days it might be mending, or sewing something for the household. Then the Guardian returns a five and he talks to the Persian ladies and the Western ladies goes home to get ready for dinner.   

Shoghi Effendi has three aunts still living in Haifa, in fact one of them lives just across the street form the Western Pilgrim house, and they and their families are all covenant breakers. Also he has 2 sisters and a brother living there and they too are Covenant Breakers. This again proves the power of the Faith, as he had no help with those who should have been firm.   

The friends who are able to make the pilgrimage now are very privileged because in the future the Shrine of the Báb will not be open even to Bahá’ís. Also the Pilgrims will not be allowed to eat with the Guardian.   

There are four steps for service to the Faith. Prayer, Mediation, Study and serve. Prayer with out action is not good. We need deeper concentration closer association and then the body of the believers will grow.   

There are 2 duties in the Faith. The Faith comes first and we should think of ourselves last. If we have the means to take care of ourselves then we must omit the last duty. He is very unhappy with the American believers because they do not respond.. They are tainted with materialism. We should study more because we work the Administration backwards. We are want to be captains in America and that proves our immaturity. He said we would never ask for that position for ourselves if we knew the responsibility it entails.   

There are three covenant breakers left at Bahjí. Perhaps you wonder as I did how this could be, but in the early days, Bahá’u’lláh urged the friends to buy property and they took it out in their names. Bahjí is like what we would call an estate, a large mansion and several of the buildings and in tone of the buildings these people live. They are slovenish and have allowed their property to become run down. The day after we arrived Leroy Ioas returned from Jerusalem where he had just finished signing the necessary papers to oust them. He was elated when he related the details to Shoghi Effendi at dinner. But the Guardian said now Leroy we must be generous and we must be patient. When this property is finally restored to the Bahá’s they will restore the building and this part will be beautified too. The gardents at Bahjí defies all description as their beauty and the immense amount of work that has been done there.   

We visited the Monumental gardens where, the Greatest Holy Leaf is buried, as well as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wife and Mother and Brother. A most wonderful place to rest for those who served so long, and so well.   

One day each city will have three institutions. The local Spiritual Assembly, Ḥaẓíra and Archives.   

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant as well as the Shield for Bahá’u’lláh.   

There are two distinct copies of the Bayán in the Archives. One in Persian and one in Arabic. Their implications are entirely different as well as the two copies of Hidden Words.   

Bahjí is the Greatest Holy Place i the world. The Shrine of the Báb is the second. At the present time the Báb’s is the most ornate, but no doubt Bahá’u’lláh’s will exceed it in the future.   

When Bahá’u’lláh left the conines of ‘Akká to go to Bahjí, all of his wives children, sisters and in-laws as well as the relatives of the Báb went with him. His wife Navváb, Greatest Holy Leaf and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stayed in ‘Akká. It is said that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was broken hearted because he wanted to be with his father, but the ones who went with Bahá’u’lláh became the covenant breakers and only those who stayed behind were firm in the Faith. No doubt Bahá’u’lláh was aware of this and took those he had to keep his eye on. Most of the ones who went with him to Bahjí died of strange diseases.   

Most Bah”is pray and then jump and do things or go to work. This is not good as one must mediate. We are so busy that we don’t hear the answer when it comes. The Americans do not know how to meditate but we must learn.   

The center of the temple is for worship, the alcoves for meditation.   

The question was asked, What day do the Bahá’ís observe as the Sabbath? Shoghi Effendi says that in your Bahá’í Life all days are worship days, but in all the Holy Books it is said we must work 6 days and rest one, so the Bahá’ís observe whatever day is the Sabbath in the country in which he lives. It presents quite a problem in the Holy Land, as there are so many religions the Moslems observe Friday, The Jews Saturday and the Christians Sunday, so those who want to take advantage of all of them do so.   

There are so many ways to show respect to the Faith, some wear long sleeves, head coverings, veils, kneel, stand and many methods of display. He does not want any ritual, but pray in the way your heart tells you. That is respect for the Faith. The Persians all prostrate themselves when entering the Shrine and are provoked that the Westerners doesn’t. The Guardian says if they are offended, that is good. In that way they can develop their own spirituality. He doesn’t want the Persians to think this is a Persian Faith.   

Bahá’u’lláh once said in a poem that he wrote that He was Gods shadow and he hoped this shadow would illumine the world. Isaiah has said that Mr. Carmel is the mountain of Lord to which all nations shallflow. Bahá’uk’llah pitched his tent in the vicinity of the Carmelite monastery, and visited Mr. Carmel 4 different times, one time staying four months. As he sat in the grove of Cypress trees, he pointed his fingers to the spot and said to ‘abdu’l-Bahá, “ This is where the Báb must be buried.” Mt. Carmel is unique in that it is quite a large mountain and quite steep. About half way down from the top, there is a shelf and that is where the Shrine sits. Certainly it was designed that way by the hand of God, for no setting could be more perfect. The Shrine is illuminated every night for a half hour, and it reminds one of a jewel in a ring.   

We must encourage minority groups. He wants the write race to be the minority, as a minority group should not be the majority in a major religion. He wants more interracial marriages, and wants more assembly representation. Jews must be attracted and they are very receptive. He should teach and work with his own race.   

The man who established the first Bahá’í community in Chicago became a Covenant breaker also the first one in Germany and Canada. He says the Covenant breakers are working diligently and warn the believers to BEWARE. Aḥmad Sorab is making a list stand and is working under cover. He has now established the Caravan of the East and West, and one can join for $.50. It is some thing like a pen pal club, but its works within is destructive. The Guardian is not worried because he says it is the work of a dying order.   

Warn the believers so do not innocently become involved.   

The cradle of western civilization (Europe) is declining and America is worried about it. America is greatly exposed to danger. The time for destruction can happen anytime. It will come fast and no one knows just when this can happen.   

When people oppose the Faith they purify it for eventually they leave it. When they are inside they act like poison. Those who reject Administration loose their judgement. They act hastily and make mistakes.   

Many pioneers choose places they can live comfortably, and pleasantly. He chuckled over this and said I wonder why the — - -Chose Brazil.   

The Bahá’í property is the only property in Israel that is exempt from taxes.   

A man from Chicago was the only Westerner present when the Báb was interred. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked that no photographs to be taken but this party sneaked a camera in and took a picture. Shoghi Effendi help bury the Báb. He was a very little boy and was down in the grave when they lowered the coffin. The Báb is in a marble sarcophagus.   

Shoghi Effendi does not say what the nature of the catastrophe will be but says it will be more disastrous than the fall of the Roman Empire. Says he has done everything to wake people up but they still sleep.   

The persecutions in Írán have practically stopped with the exceptions of some isolated areas. He says that during the Ramaḍán Fast Period, the Moslems work themselves up into a frenzy and then their cruel nature come out and they must kill. A the Bahá’ís are a real threat to them now, that is where they struck. While it is to bad for the believers the Faith received more publicity then it cold have had if we had to buy it. Regardless of what happens it is good for the Faith.   

You know that while you are in the household of Shoghi effendi you are protected by his love, and one can feel it, because you feel utmost peace of mind, but the minute you step your foot from there you have a very great responsibility. You won’t know until you pray and meditate about it, then the door will be opened.   

Everything the Guardian does denotes Unity. For instance in one of those gardens next to the Shrine, one sees Cactus growing from the tropical countries and red roses from the cold countries. If the flowers can grow and flourish from different parts of the world, then surely humans can.   

The Guardian tells you at dinner at night when you go to Bahjí. He says it is the culmination of your pilgrimage no matter at what time during your stay, you might go. The pilgrim from Mew York, Millie collins, Mason Remey Elmer and myself went. We arrived there about 5 in the afternoon, and went first to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. It is similar inside to that of the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá must have welcomed them after his many years of confinement. It is in the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh that I felt I wanted to say prayers for the many different new who had asked to be remembered. AS for myself I could not ask for anything other than understanding and tolerance to be able to serve.   

To ask for material things does not enter your mind. In the evening we visited the Mansion. The room where Bahá’u’lláh passed away and the same one Prof. browne visited him in. It is just exactly as Bahá’u’lláh left it, even to his slippers being placed beside the bed. There are many beautiful things at Bahjí, along with priceless relics belonging to the different members of the family. Here, I think where one feels the individuality of your pilgrimage. Needless to say I did not sleep the first night. A thousand questions thru my mind, and I pictured many things back over the years. Then to the nightingales sang so loud all night, that sleep was impossible. I remembered the passage in God Passes By, where Bahá’u’lláh made that statement. I would have thought that I imagined it if the pilgrim from New York had not mentioned it too. One wonders if they are greeting you or issuing a warning. This I can not answer. The second night the birds did not sing, and I did not sleep either. Elmer being very tired slept like a babe. So I will still wonder. The questions were all gone in the morning. The house reeks with a great power and it seems to descend down upon you.   

The second day we visited ‘Akká. First to the prison. The government now is using it for a mental hospital and no doubt has fixed it up, but it is most distressing. I know that all I needed to see was the prison room where Bahá’u’lláh spent two years of his life, to convince me that the e Bahá’í Faith is God’s Bounty for today. No one but a Holy One would have given up a life of luxury to spend his life in this place. It was here the Purest Branch fell through the roof and the family was confined in two adjoining cells. The room is bare with the exception of a pallet on the floor. From there we went to the house of abud, so named because Abud was the man who owned it, Here again one sees many things belonging to the family. Also the room where the Azdas was revealed and the room where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was married.   

Selah took us on a tour of the ancient walled city and the air is so foul that it makes me sick. It is an Arab city with many strange habits. Veiled woman and turbened men. The streets are narrow and dirty. We measured one street and found it to be 5ft. wide. The great thick gates that clanged shut when Bahá’u’lláh entered the city. Here also we saw the mosque of Eskar, meaning Butcher, it was so named because the governor who built it was so called and caused so many people to be put to death. It was here we heard the call to prayer at 6:30 from the minaret. The Arabs come in their garbs and wash their hands and face in the fountain and then wash their feet. They take their shoes and place them in front of the Mosque and go in to pray.   

We saw several of the houses Bahá’u’lláh lived if for short periods of time when first released form prison, along with the house where Shoghi Effendi was born.   

From ‘Akká we went to Mazreth. The first house Bahá’u’lláh lived in after he left the prison city. One is greeted with such hospitality by the lady who lives there. She shows you through the house and the rooms occupied by the Holy Family. Fresh flowers are kept by the bed at all time. She served us a delicious lunch, including a pudding she makes, which looks and tastes something like cornstarch pudding ,This she put the greatest name on top in chocolate.   

Then we next went to the garden of Riḍván. Again perhaps you wondered why they spoke of the garden in different ways. The garden of Riḍván where he spent 12 days with his family is at Ba<u>gh</u>dád. This garden of Riḍván is about 5 miles orth of ‘Akká, and where he used to wander and sit in the shade of the trees. Anice stream runs through the place and no doubt it was cool and pleasant to sit in. Then back to Bahjí. The second morning at Bahjí, we all visited the Shrine by ourself. One can stay as long as one likes. This is a great privilege because Shoghi Effendi says the time will come when even Bahá’ís cannot go there. I hope I shall always keep the high ideals I realized at these Holy Places.   

About smoking. The Báb forbade it... Bahá’u’lláh revoked the law and never spoke of it again... The Tablet of Purity was written by ‘abdu’l-Bahá and it was his wish. However He was not the lawgiver. The Guardian says if you want to smoke... go ahead and smoke. No one is going to stop you. How ever it is still a dirty, expensive habit, and is better if we quit. The greatest Holy leaf, who is the highest symbol of Purity, smoked up until she died at about 85 years old. ‘Abdu’l Faz’l was a chain smoker. It is not forbidden.   

They were tearing down an old building at Bahjí that was owned by the Covenant breakers that the Bahá’ís had been trying to buy. It was finally condemned by the officials and torn down. They found in a small room at one end of a building a grave and a Christian Altar. Built by the man who built Bahjí, Shoghi Effendi says this must be preserved.   

The first night back at the Pilgrim House Shoghi Effendi explains things connected with the shrines. The Most Great Prison is at ‘Akká. The remote prison spoken of in the Tablet of Achmad is at Adrianople.   

The catastrophe is inevitable and needs be to purge the world. It will be something the world has never seen and will effect every nation country class and creed. The world has high blood pressure and this will be the e blood letting. Blood will run everywhere. It will purge the world and then cement the remnants together. The Administration is the Embryo of the New World Order. The New World Order is the child and it will mature into the World Civilization. There will be no decline in the future. It will be like a spiral, ever upwards. Tehre may be moments that stop, but no decline. This is &The day that is not followed by Night.”   

There are many ways that people pray. He wants no set ritual. Pray according to your heart. This is not a Persian Religion, but Divine in Origin, world embracing in scope, and spiritual in character. Once materialism is wiped away, it will not return, but a more spiritual world will exist. There will always be evil but it will be more restricted. Man will always have an opportunity to use his will. The next prophet will be persecuted and will bring His own book and laws. There will always be tests. We are approaching the darkest before dawn. no one knows when this can happen but any time/  It will come fast. Anything that happens even to the destruction of the temples in this world for they knew their reward was greater in the next world, but suffering is our greatest development. It gives us the chance to develop our greatest opportunity, The Life God gave Us to live.   

In the future there will be no white race.   

The new York pilgrims last night came and Shoghi Effendi told her that the first part of her pilgrimage was over and the 2nd part was to impart. Go back and tell the people of New York to get out and particularly pioneer to France. Stay out of Paris. It is the only way to save the individual and also the Faith. Regardless what the government does it cannot prevent the catastrophe.....12,000,000 people in New York cannot be saved. It will come swift and sudden and whole cities will be leveled to the ground.   

New York is named the City of the Covenant because it is the most corrupt city in the world..therefore it needs the greatest transformation. Persia is the cradle of the Faith, America the cradle of Administration. America is named because it is the most corrupt nation. Bahá’ís are wasting their time in cities. They must go out to small towns. Cities will not respond until after destruction.   

America and Persia must suffer. Bahá’ís must suffer. Bahá’ís must learn to sacrifice because this materialism is hindering our progress in the next world. Life in this world does not matter.   

Lack of love in communities hinders our growth.   

Bahá’ís cannot belong to the Masons because it is a secret organization and there can be no secret meetings in Bahá’í. Also their policy is not Universal...it is different in the East than the West. Even if your old age depends on it, you must give it up. In no way can you sacrifice Spiritual Principal. A member of any organization must first ask the L.S.A. if they can belong. Even though they are not political in character, their implication may be political. If the L.S.A. cannot answer, contact the National and they must investigate and report back.   

I had been noticing the non-use of the Pronoun I. Shoghi Effendi has used it twice both times in referring to “I have incorporated that in God Passes by”.   

If a believer should be forced to quit his job and is destitute because of an organization the L.S.a. must see that he is taken care of, even to raising a special funds. This is good for the Faith. So many organizations today are corrupt but only the top authority knows the full extent of their principals. The Faith should always come first, regardless of what hardship it entails. We must remember that now all World Forces are against the Bahá’í faith, so Bahá’ís must learn to lean on one another, show forth love that people will be attracted.   

There is too much lethargy in American committees. To much committee activity which hampers teaching work and kills the spirit. Teaching is the most important and it is the duty of each believer to teach.   

Guardian says he feels things and no doubt but what he knows everything going on in the Cause.   

 The new Pilgrims arrived from New York, Bob and Keith Quigley. Once again the Guardian talked of the catastrophe. Says America is the most corrupt nation in the world and is contaminating the other nations; therefore it will suffer the worst. I asked if this was war. He sad yes and other things too. The most fiery ordeal the world has ever known. The whole world will be like a compulsion. This must be so that it can be cleansed. The flame will cleanse and also weld.   

The Báb gave the mandate to scatter, assistance was promised by Bahá’u’lláh. The desire by Bahá’u’lláh. The desire by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and now the Administration says we must disperse. The foundation of this cause was laid by God, the Administration by the institutions and the teaching by individuals. He says: Maintain the Heros, increase the Saints and lessen the Administrators.   

The Islands in the Pacific is most important, and the brown race. He wants young people to go these places and they will be difficult.   

Go back and tell the people to disperse. He says it is not enough to be converted to the Faith, You must have the desire to serve and teach.   

The first night after we returned from Bahjí, Shoghi Effendi said “Now that you have been to acca, read the two chapters in God Passes By about ‘Akká” and before you go to Ba<u>gh</u>dád read the Chapter referring to Ba<u>gh</u>dád. The friends told us afterward that they had not heard him make that remark to any other pilgrim. So now we wonder if ours will be the privilege to make that journey.   

When the Guardian realizes you have absorbed to capacity, he makes a humorous remark which breaks the tension. One lists so closely.   

In the Shrine of the &Báb over the Arcade there are blocks designed with a green border and spots of red in it. This denotes the lineage of the Báb and the red denotes blood. In the future there may be inscriptions in these blocks.   

Finally the last night of our pilgrimage came, and I felt a little nervous because I was wondering what our duty would be. The Guardian talked at what seemed lengths about the latitudes and longitudes where the Faith was now established. One wonders how he had all the figures at his finger tips. He said those that reject the Administration loose their judgement. They act hastily and make mistakes. Sa’íd to take our filled cup back to Spokane and let it spill over. A plan without organization is not good; and an organization without a plan is not good.   

Then quickly he turned to us and said “now tell me your plans for pioneering. We told him that we had thought of going to Central America and as far as we had gotten with plans and He said that is good, that’s what I want you to do. You have the special blessing of Bahá’u’lláh and I will say special prayers for you. Life will be different and there will be many hardships but do not get discouraged and be patient and you will be very successful. We both knew that is what we must do and we are proceeding with our plans hoping they materialize quickly.   

He gave us each a vial of attar of roses and asked that we anoint the friends with his love. The pilgrims from New York wept uncontrollably, as did the rest. Rhuyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum said later, that some times the Guardian got her down. It is a very tense moment and one realizes that the first part of the pilgrimage is over and you dread to leave, but on surely feels better prepared to face the next task.   

Rhuyyih gave me a pair of prayer beads that had been in the Shrine and Elmer a key ring made from an old persian coin o the Guardians and also a picture of the Guardian when he was a baby.   

A few after notes. While in Haifa we visited the cemetery where Esselmont is buried.   

Went shopping with Rhuyyih <u>Kh</u>ánun one afternoon.   

When Shoghi Effendi was a little boy he used to say to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that he wished he had a name, as people in that part of the world was known by the name of the place that they lived, but Shoghi Effendi wished it so hard that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave him the name of Rabbání.   

Shoghi Effendi spoke one night at the dinner table that the Faith progressed like an automobile it needs a motor and a battery and Rhuyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum said “But Shoghi effendi it must have a driver too”, and he said #Yes, that is the finger of Bahá’u’lláh. No glory for himself, He is truly humble.   

I do not feel that my notes would be complete without telling you of Athens. As we were planning to stop there anyway, we delivered some books to the friends there. It is so difficult to mail anything as mail is censured in Greece. The evening of the Declaration of the Báb, the first Bahá’í in Greece was enrolled. A young man of about 25 years old, and as he did not speak English and they did not speak Greek he was taught through a paid translator. Note: this translator is now studying the Faith for enrollment. This enrollment completed the last virgin territory in Europe. It was a thrilling evening for all.   

When we arrived in England, we were so tired of large cities, castles, palaces, and churches, we decided to go to South Hampton, where we would stay for four days until time to embark on the Queen Mary. We had been there about an hour when a man spoke to us and offered to direct us to any place we might want to see. Sa’íd hewas just walking around and recognized us as strangers. One does not pick up with strangers in strange countries but he looked so kind that we talked a long while with him. He finally invited us to his house for tea. So after calling his wife we call da cab and went. She was just as lovely and while drinking tea they asked the reason for our trip. So the conversation turned towards telling them of the Faith. They were most receptive, and to make things brief we spent all of our time with them. They got special permit to board the queen Mary so they might be with us and brought a bouquet of roses for our cabin. AS they went up the gang plank their last words were, “You are the first BAha’is we have met but you won’t be the last for we will hunt them up.” AS our boat sailed we received a telegram from them. We feel that this visit was a wonderful part of our pilgrimage and hope that the first to Bahá’ís in SouthHampton will be the lovely friends we met in England.   

It is our wish that each one of the friends can some day make the pilgrimage and we know that no sacrifice, in order to make it.   

Gladys and Elmer Beasley.

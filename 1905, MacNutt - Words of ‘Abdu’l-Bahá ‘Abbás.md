### (Anointing with rose water)

Now have we, the beloved of God, gathered together to partake of material and spiritual food. As this perfume is to the nostrils, so many spiritual fragrance refresh the soul.  

‘You are in prison here, my partners in imprisonment, prisoners of love, God be praised’  

### (Serving the food)

This is a blessed supper of the Lord for we have gathered under the shadow of the Blessed Perfection.  

Christ said: “I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever.”  

This meeting is through the love of the Blessed Perfection. Jesus said, “Lovest thou me, Perfect? Food my lambs”  

It is prophesied in the Heavenly Books that so shall they sit down at the Lord’s table. From the east and the west so shall they come to sit down in His Kingdom. In the last day, all the sheep shall be gathered together.  

In this manner shall ye gather together in America. Then shall the bounties of the Blessed Perfection descend upon you, divine Assistance will be given to you and from your meeting the love of God will be spread to all men.  

Strive, strive always that ye may be united. If one single sheep strays away from the fold, do all in your power to bring it back. Kindness and love must be your means of gathering all together.

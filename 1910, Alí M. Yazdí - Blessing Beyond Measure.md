##  Blessings Beyond Measure 

###  ‘Alí M. Yazdí 

                 Ages, cycles, nay, thousands of generations
                   must pass away before the Sun of Truth
                          may mount its zenith and
                     shine again in its full splendor.
                   Now that...ye have been called to life
                    and gathered together in this Age,...
                          how thankful ye must be! — ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ

##  FOREWORD 

When, as <span data-pg-empty=""> a girl, I heard of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the son of the Founder of the
Bahá’í Faith, and became a believer, I had an overwhelming longing to see Him
and to attain His presence. But I was young, World War I was raging,
communication with the Holy Land was cut off, and travel out of the question.
I did write asking permission, but the letter was apparently lost, and there
was no answer.   

Later, when I entered the University of California at Berkeley in the fall
of 1920, I again wrote to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and asked how I could serve the Faith,
what studies to pursue, and for permission to make the pilgrimage. His loving
reply was sent to me by Kathryn Frankland after her own visit to the Master in
November of that year. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá answered all my questions in His Tablet
and said, “I hope that you... <span data-pg-empty="">
may make the visit, but at present it is not possible.” [^] A year later
‘Abdu’l-Bahá passed away.   

[^ ] See Marion C. Yazdí, “Youth in the Vanguard: Memoirs and Letters Collected
“by the First Bahá’í Student at Berkeley and at Stanford University”,
foreword by ‘Alí M. Yazdí (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1982)
34, 36, for the text of her letter to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response.


A young Persian Bahá’í came to the University of California at Berkeley
in the fall of 1921 to study civil engineering. He was remarkable in every
respect, well-versed in the Bahá’í teachings, and devoted to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Who was called the Master. This exemplary and fascinating student was
<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí Yazdí, or ‘Alí for short. []() As a boy and youth, he had often been
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His grandson, Shoghi Effendi. It was three months
after our meeting that we faced together the catastrophic loss of the beloved
Master. []()   

[^ ] See ibid., 36, 40, for a description of ‘Alí on his arrival in Berkeley,
California. 
[^ ] See ibid., 46, on the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

When I was with ‘Alí, I would beg him to tell me about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:
“What was He like?” His descriptions filled me with awe and joy; I was
enchanted and uplifted. Throughout our friendship and later our marriage, I
loved to listen to him talk about the Master; I came to feel that I, too, had
actually seen Him and been in His presence.   

I often hoped ‘Alí would write down his early experiences in the Faith for
our children and grandchildren and for the Bahá’ís and other friends. But he
was reluctant to speak or write about his intimate experiences with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his unique years with Shoghi Effendi. Then one day in 1975,
though gravely ill and suffering, ‘Alí stood up from his desk and with a radiant
smile gave me a number of pages entitled “Prophetic Days — Memories of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “ herein called “Blessings Beyond Measure”. The account
that follows is essentially as my husband wrote it. <span data-pg-empty=""> I have included a few
details from a talk he gave on 2 November 1975 at Haas Clubhouse on the
Berkeley campus of the University of California.   

‘Alí’s wish to write down his recollections of young Shoghi Effendi was not
realized. However, he did speak on his memories of Shoghi Effendi at the
above-mentioned occasion, and I have included the transcription of that
recorded talk here. I have also added sections from a 1 July 1975 interview
with ‘Alí that Beth McKenty made for the National Bahá’í Information Office,
as well as excerpts from a talk he gave at the home of our daughter and
son-in-law, Barbara and Jim Markert, on 23 October 1977. In addition, I have
quoted passages from the diary and from the youthful letters of Shoghi Effendi
to which ‘Alí alluded in his talk. The very personal letters of Shoghi Effendi
to his young friend ‘Alí, written before and after matriculating at Oxford
University, are published here for the first time.   

A word of explanation regarding these intensely interesting memoirs is in
order. The accounts of ‘Alí’s years with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his grandson Shoghi
Effendi — filled as they are with experiences that affected ‘Alí profoundly all
his life — should still be considered as pilgrim’s notes, one person’s
impressions sincerely given. It should also be pointed out that the spoken
words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi reported here may or may not be
exact quotations. <span data-pg-empty=""> The translations of the tablets of the Master (with the
exception of the one to Roy C. Wilhelm, the original of which has not been found)
and the letters of Shoghi Effendi, however, are all authentic.   

I acknowledge with thanks the publication in 1986 of an earlier and
shorter version of my husband’s recollections of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in “The Bahá’í
“World”, volume 18.[ ]() An earlier version of ‘Alí’s memoirs of Shoghi Effendi will
appear in volume 19 of “The Bahá’í World”. ‘Alí’s recollections of Shoghi
Effendi as a youth were reviewed for accuracy by Shoghi Effendi’s widow, the
Hand of the Cause of God Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum.

I want to express warmest appreciation to Dr. Betty J. Fisher and Anne
Atkinson for their proficient editing and no less for their insight and feeling
for the subject matter.   

It gives me pleasure to make available to others these blessed experiences
with the Master and with Shoghi Effendi in the early life of ‘Alí Yazdí.

##  PART ONE — Recollections of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  

###  ‘Alí M. Yazdí 

We live in an age in which God is openly denied and religion is ignored
and discredited as archaic and even harmful.   

Yet paradoxically, we live in an age that has witnessed the appearance of
a new Manifestation with a Message for this Day — with solutions to the problems
that are plaguing people everywhere. A Prophet of God has actually walked the
earth in our time! Such is His claim, and such is the claim of those who have
rallied to His call. His life, His teachings all testify to the validity of
His station. His name is Bahá’u’lláh.[]()   

[^ ] Bahá’u’lláh, the Prophet-Founder of the Bahá’í Faith lived from 1817
to 1892. His title means “The Glory of God.” — Ed. 

We are fortunate to live in an age when the Manifestation
has walked the earth; <span data-pg-empty=""> it is an experience that is not given to many
generations. For even though those who have seen Bahá’u’lláh are all but
gone, there are some now living who have known people who have known and seen
Bahá’u’lláh.[^] There are some who have known and seen His son, the Center of
His Covenant and His appointed Successor, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. And there are more
who have known His great-grandson, Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Cause
of God.[^]   

[^ ] When ‘Alí Yazdí wrote this account in 1975, there was probably no one still
living who had met Bahá’u’lláh. No one who met Bahá’u’lláh is now
alive. — Ed.
[^ ] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was born in 1844 and died in 1921; Shoghi Effendi was born
in 1897 and died in 1957. — Ed.

Now, obviously, knowledge of the Manifestation and the Center of the
Covenant does not necessitate being in their physical presence. Yet being in
their presence, feeling the spell of their power and love, is an experience of
inimitable value and bounty. It is something that those of us who have
experienced it feel over and above even the holy words. It is a blessing that
imparts a tangible feeling of things spiritual. It enables us to reappraise
and change our outlook and gain perspective, insight, vision. It adds zest and
new hope to life.   

It has been my privilege to have had a father who knew and served
Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi. <span data-pg-empty=""> His name was Ḥájí
Muḥammad Yazdí.   

It has been my inestimable privilege to have known ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His
chosen successor  — Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian. While it is still possible, I
would like to share the experience with others. I hope to give as best I can a
little of the living Faith.   

What can I add to what is already known? I dare-say very little. There
have been many books on the subject. Shoghi Effendi’s history “God Passes By
has wonderful chapters on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and there was no one in the world,
after Bahá’u’lláh, who was closer to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá than Shoghi Effendi. He
not only loved Him, but he understood Him. “The Chosen Highway” by Lady
Blomfield is a remarkable book on the subject, and there are others.[]() My
contribution will be mainly personal, a firsthand account of the feelings and
thoughts evoked in me when I was in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. I will
include incidents I learned from my father, Ḥájí Muḥammad Yazdí.

But first, I would like to give some background — a few highlights about
the Yazdí family and the early days of the Faith — beginning with the period
just after the martyrdom of the Báb and before and after the declaration of
Bahá’u’lláh.[]() <span data-pg-empty="">   

[^ ] The Báb, Whose title means “the Gate, “ was the Prophet-Forerunner of the
Bahá’í Faith. In 1850 He was executed by a firing squad in a public
square in Tabriz, Persia (now Írán). In 1863 Bahá’u’lláh made His public
announcement that He was the Promised One Whom the Báb had foretold. — Ed.

------

###  FAMILY BACKGROUND 

Around 1856 the little city of Yazd, in the very heart of Persia, was
carrying on its lackluster existence, its people mostly ignorant and
poverty-stricken, unaware of what was going on in the rest of the world. But
there was something special stirring. There was hushed talk of the Báb, the
new Prophet Who had been martyred, and of the Message He had brought. There
were people secretly spreading the news at the risk of their lives.   

A youth, a mere adolescent only fourteen years old, contacted these
people, heard the Message, and wholeheartedly accepted it. His name was
<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí.[]() He was the oldest son of the well-to-do and highly respected
Ḥájí ‘Abdu’r-Raḥím Yazdí.[]() The family was alarmed. The boy was
in grave danger. His allegiance could bring ruin to the whole family. But
<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí was ablaze.   

[^ ] <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí, who was born in 1842, was the first member of the Yazdí
family to accept the religion of the Báb in 1856. He was the uncle of
‘Alí Yazdí, for whom ‘Alí was named at his birth by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. — Ed.
[^ ] Ḥájí ‘Abdu’r-Raḥm Yazdí (also spelled ‘Abdu’l-Raḥím
Yazdí, as the name is pronounced) was the grandfather of ‘Alí Yazdí. — Ed.

To distract him from the Bábí Faith, his father sent him to Kirmán with
enough goods to start a business. <span data-pg-empty=""> The shop was successful, but soon rumors
floated back that he was meeting with the Bábís. ‘Abdu’r-Raḥím went to Kirmán
and brought him home.   

In Yazd <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí again attended the secret meetings. He took aid to
the beleaguered Bábís who were imprisoned there. One night he was so late
returning home that his mother, terribly worried, waited for him at the door.
When he came in, without saying a word, she slapped him. <span data-pg-empty=""> Without a word, he
took her hand and kissed it tenderly and looked at her with deep love.   

Throughout this fearsome time, despite the calumnies and persecutions by
the enemies of the Bábís, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí displayed a kindness and
fearlessness unbelievable in one so young. As time passed, his character, his
behavior, the change in his life, his attitude, and his sacrifice, all the
things he did, gradually won over the whole family who, one by one, joined the
Faith.[]()   

[^ ] As a young man, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí went to ‘Akká to serve Bahá’u’lláh. He
performed many missions. In Khartoum, where he went to take messages from
Bahá’u’lláh to Mírzá Ḥaydar-‘Alí and other believers who had
been imprisoned, he contracted a disease and died in the Sudan. — Ed. 

They began having meetings in the Yazdí home, in secret of course.
Teachers came from other cities, each with new tales. Some came from Ba<u>gh</u>dád,
and they spoke of Bahá’u’lláh. Later others came from Adrianople, where
Bahá’u’lláh was banished, and then from ‘Akká, where He was exiled until the
end of His life.   

My father, Muḥammad Yazdí, who, like his brother <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí, had
joined the Faith when he was fourteen, left for the Holy Land with a friend, a
donkey, lots of faith, and very little money. they set out to see
Bahá’u’lláh and traveled over steep, rugged mountains and across hot, arid
plains until they arrived in ‘Akká around 1870. Other members of the family
came later.   

Ḥájí ‘Abdu’r-Raḥím, my grandfather, left Yazd
after he had been tortured, beaten, and bastinadoed. <span data-pg-empty=""> The story of this “precious
soul, “ as the Master called him, his arrival in the prison city of ‘Akká, and
his life there, is told with tender compassion by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in “Memorials of the Faithful”.[^]   

[^ ] See ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Memorials of the Faithful”, trans. Marzieh Gail
(Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1971), 64-66.

Each member of the Yazdí family arrived and was given an assignment by
Bahá’u’lláh. He always gave each person who came to see Him a special
mission, sending him out to serve the Faith in various places. <span data-pg-empty=""> Ḥájí
Muḥammad (my father) and two other believers were sent to Egypt.   

------

###  FIRST BAHÁ’Í SETTLERS IN EGYPT 

My father and his friends worked hard in Egypt for many years and
eventually built up a prosperous business. Through them, all young men, the
Faith was first established in Alexandria, Cairo, and Port Sa‘íd. In each of
these cities the believers formed a well knit society where they not only
joined in Bahá’í activities but in social and business life as well. They
married almost exclusively within their own community, so that many of them
became related to one another. Thus they were a family in fact, as well as in
practice.   

They were not free to teach the Faith openly because of the suspicion and
accusations of the authorities in Turkey and Palestine, which carried over into
predominantly Muslim Egypt. They had a few Egyptian and Syrian believers, but
the great majority were Persian. The Bahá’ís formed a Persian colony as well,
maintaining Persian customs, language, and Bahá’í convictions. They were on
good terms with the larger population around them and were generally liked and
respected.   

My family and I lived in Alexandria, or, more exactly, in a suburb of
Alexandria called Ramleh, a beautiful and peaceful residential district
stretched right along the sandy beaches of the blue Mediterranean. There were
gardens on one side; on the south side, east of the Nile, were the Nubian
plains. <span data-pg-empty=""> The best section, owned by Europeans and rich Egyptians, was next to
the shore.   

There was another section, a middle-class area, which had some villas, but
mostly there were older, once luxurious houses. It was in two of the latter
that we successively made our home. The house where I was born and grew to the
age of four or five had a separate guest house and a large garden surrounded by
a wall of rough-hewn stone covered with broken glass on top to secure both
privacy and safety. Within the garden there were many rose bushes and many
lime, sweet lemon, orange, and pomegranate trees. <span data-pg-empty="">In the summer a tropical
scent hung in the air.   

Later we moved to another house. It, too, had a large garden with a huge
wall and an annex where we cultivated eggplants, green peppers, dill, melons,
corn, sugar cane, and the like. In the main garden we had mulberry trees,
green lawns, and a bed of violets. Jasmine grew over the veranda, a large open
porch adjoining the garden. Here our family often had breakfast, with Father
presiding at the samovar and dispensing hot tea in hot glasses to the adults
and hot water with a drop of tea floating on top to the children.   

Before breakfast, however, we chanted our morning prayers ad heard Father
tell wonderful stories about his experiences with Bahá’u’lláh and the Master
or read the latest communications from the Holy Land.   

One of the stories was about Bahá’u’lláh and a money belt.
Bahá’u’lláh had sent my father and his friends to Egypt as pioneer settlers.
When they arrived in Egypt, they did not have much money. Money was not in
abundance among the Bahá’ís. For one thing, it was taken away from them;
they were persecuted. For example, my grandfather was a rich man when he
became a Bábí, but all he had was seized. Not having money did not stop my
father from pioneering. He and the others got notions — spools of thread,
needles, thimbles, ribbons — and they went to the European homes up and down the
Mediterranean coast from Alexandria to Ramleh, like peddlers. People invited
them in and bought those things. <span data-pg-empty=""> My father became very popular. He looked
quite different from the Egyptians; he was very fair complexioned,
very white and pink. He was honest, as were all the Bahá’ís. People were
not used to that. And so the pioneers became famous. People told their
friends about them, and gradually they prospered. They would meet at the end
of the day and pool their resources, put their money together, and work in a
truly Bahá’í fashion.   

Before too long they had enough capital to open a store. They called
themselves the “Societe Rúḥáníyyih," meaning “Spiritual Company", and
the store, the “Grand Bazar Persian.” It became bigger and bigger until it was
the largest and best department store in all of Egypt. The Faith had prospered
also, in spite of the restrictions, and was well established in Alexandria,
Cairo, and Port Sa‘íd.   

My father and his friends wanted to show their gratitude to Bahá’u’lláh
and also help the Faith. So they took a wide belt, a money belt, stuffed it
with gold, large gold coins, and sent it to Bahá’u’lláh. A tablet was
received from Bahá’u’lláh expressing His appreciation.   

In the 1880s there was a rebellion. An Egyptian general by the name of
Aḥmad Arabi Pá<u>sh</u>á arose, and he wanted to destroy all the Europeans in
Alexandria. There were riots. Of course, the wealth was in the hands of the
Europeans, and they were robbed. All the populace wanted was an excuse to
pillage, steal, and destroy.   

The French and British sent their fleets to Alexandria and threatened a
bombardment if the pillage did not stop. All the European people left in
ships. <span data-pg-empty=""> My father and the friends took the last ship out of the harbor before the actual
bombardment.   

When the rebellion was over, about seven months later, they came back and
went to the site of their business. There was nothing there but rubble and
ashes — absolutely nothing. They were desperate. People asked when they would
open a new store, and they had no answer. Their credit had been good, but now
they needed some down payment, and they did not have it.   

One day they were meeting together, consulting and praying, when
unexpectedly the postman came with a card — a notice of a package at the post
office. They went to the post office, got the package, took it home, and
opened it. There was the belt they had sent to Bahá’u’lláh, untouched and
full of gold. They reestablished credit and started their business again. It
flourished more than ever.   

------

###  MEMORIES OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ IN RAMLEH 

Stories like the one my father told about Bahá’u’lláh and the money belt
left an indelible impression on me. It was in such a setting, when I was a
child, that I heard the news of the coming of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Ramleh. I
heard that suddenly, without warning, He had left Haifa on a steamer bound for
Europe, that He had stopped in Port Sa‘íd because of ill health and fatigue, and
that He was coming to Alexandria. Then the news came that “He was coming to
“Ramleh!” To Ramleh where we lived! What a miracle! <span data-pg-empty=""> There was intense joy within my family, within the
Bahá’í community, within me. Of all the places in the world, He happened to
choose Ramleh as His headquarters for His trips to Europe and America during
the period between 1910 and 1913.   

I was a schoolboy, eleven years old. Excitement swirled through my mind,
and along with it curiosity and anticipation. All I knew about Him was what I
had heard my father tell us. No one in the family that I knew except Father
and Grandfather had seen Him.[]() There were no pictures then, except an early
one taken when He was a young man in Adrianople. He was a prisoner beyond our
reach — a legendary and heroic Figure.   

[^ ] This grandfather was Ḥájí ‘Alí Man<u>sh</u>adi, ‘Alí’s maternal
grandfather, who lived in a guest house on the family’s property in Ramleh
and who was very close to ‘Alí. — Ed. 

Now He was free. And He was coming to Ramleh. What would He be like?
How would it feel to be in the presence of the Center of the Covenant, the son
and successor of a Manifestation of God? I knew that He was not only a holy
man, but a divine man, that although He was not a Manifestation, still He had a
divine station. Much went on in my mind as I prepared for His arrival. But I
kept it all to myself.   

The Bahá’í Faith was an integral part of me, not something superimposed.
In Ramleh I was surrounded by it. I lived it. I believed it. I cherished
its spiritual concepts as well as its goals and its principles. <span data-pg-empty=""> I
realized its fundamental importance, its necessity for the world today. Yet my
studies at the French school I attended had opened other areas to my mind. The
logical and systematic approach and the discoveries and applications of science
fascinated me. I believed they provided us with effective tools for the
implementation of the teachings of the Faith. I prayed that I might be guided
to play some role in this endeavor. The feeling came over me that my contact
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would provide the inspiration and the impetus to a move in
this direction.   

Hence, I waited eagerly for the day, which came in October 1910.   

A crowd gathered in front of the Hotel Victoria for His arrival. Suddenly
there was a hush, a stillness, and I knew that He had come. I looked. There
He was! Then He walked through the crowd — slowly, majestically, smiling
radiantly as He greeted the bowed heads on each side. I could only get a vague
impression of Him, as I could not get near Him. The sound of the wind and the
surf from the nearby shore drowned out His voice so that I could hardly hear
Him. Nevertheless, I went away happy.   

A few days later a villa was rented for Him and His family not far from
the Hotel Victoria. It was in the best residential section, next to the
beautiful Mediterranean and the beaches. Like all the villas in that area, it
has a garden with flowers and flowering shrubs. <span data-pg-empty=""> It was there that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá chose to receive a great variety of notables, public figures,
clerics, aristocrats, and writers — as well as poor despairing people.   

(* photograph *) <span data-pg-empty="">   

I went there often, sometimes on the way home from school, sometimes on
weekends. I spent most of my time outside of school in His garden. I would
wait to get a glimpse of Him as He came out for His customary walk or conversed
with pilgrims from faraway places. To hear His vibrant and melodious voice
ringing in the open air and to see Him exhilarated me and gave me hope. Quite
often He came to me and smiled and talked. There was a radiance about Him, an
almost unlimited kindness and love that shone from Him. Seeing Him infused me
with a feeling of goodness. I felt humble and at the same time exceedingly
happy.   

I also had many opportunities to see the Master (Sarkár-i-Áqá as we
called Him) at meetings and festive occasions. I especially remember the first
time He came to our house to address a large gathering of believers. The
friends were all gathered, talking happily, waiting. All of a sudden there was
quiet. I could hear from the outside the voice of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá — very
resonant, very beautiful — before He entered the room. Then He swept in, His
robe flowing.   

He was straight as an arrow. His head was thrown back. His silver-gray
hair fell in waves to His shoulders. His beard was white. His eyes were keen;
His forehead, broad. He wore a white turban around an ivory felt cap. He
looked at everyone, smiled, and welcomed all with “<u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ámadíd.
<u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ámadíd” (“Welcome. Welcome”).   

I had been taught that in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá I should sit or
stand with my hands crossed in
front of me and look down. <span data-pg-empty=""> I was so anxious to see Him that I found myself
looking up furtively now and then.   

He spoke often and on many subjects. For nine months it seemed like
paradise. Then He left us and, after three months in Cairo, sailed for
Europe.[]() How dismal everything became. But there was school, and
there were duties. Exciting news reached us from Europe, and there were
memories.

[^ ] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá moved to Cairo early May 1911 and left for Europe on 11
August 1911. — Ed. 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá came back four months later. <span data-pg-empty=""> Paradise returned. He spoke to me on several occasions.
    He always called me “<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí", the name He
Himself had given me, after my uncle <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí, who was the first member of
the family to join the Faith. When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke to me, I would look
into His eyes — blue, smiling, and full of love.

###  ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ’S DEPARTURE FOR AMERICA 

Again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left us, this time for America.[]() I will never
forget the scene of His departure, as He came out of the house and turned to
wave His last farewell to His disconsolate family looking down from the
veranda above. They were greatly concerned about His safety and well-being.
He was sixty-eight years old. He had suffered many hardships and gone through
severe trials. He had been in prison for forty years of His life. And now He
was undertaking a journey to a far-off country utterly different from any to
which He was accustomed.   

[^ ] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sailed from Alexandria for New York on the SS “Cedric” on 25
March 1912. — Ed. 

But ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had made up His mind. <span data-pg-empty=""> And when He made up His mind,
nothing could change Him. He strode out of the garden gate without looking back. He walked for
several blocks near the shore to take the electric train to Alexandria, where
He would board the ship that was to take Him to New York. He was followed by
about thirty believers who walked silently behind Him. I was one of them.   

What ‘Abdu’l-Bahá accomplished during His nine-month stay in America is
now history.[]() From there He went on to Europe and then back to Ramleh on 17
July 1913 to stay until the following December. After that visit He left for
Haifa, never to return.   

[^ ] See Shoghi Effendi, “God Passes By”, 281-83, 287-90; Balyuzi,
“‘Abdu’l-Bahá”, 171-316; Allen L. Ward, “239 Days: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Journey
in America” (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1979); and Marion

“First Bahá’í Student at Berkeley and at Stanford University”, foreword by
‘Alí M. Yazdí (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1982), chapters. 2 and
8. 

That was the first chapter of my experience with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, when I
was a child between the ages of eleven and fourteen.

###  MEMORIES OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ IN HAIFA 

Destiny had it, however, that in 1914 my family would move to Beirut, not
far to the north of Haifa.[]() This opened the second chapter in which I was
privileged to be in the presence of the Master — but only on special occasions.

[^ ] When ‘Alí was fifteen years old, he had qualified for the French
baccalaureate, the equivalent of a degree for two years of an American
university. But when the war broke out between France and Turkey, the French
Brothers’ schools were closed. He hoped the war would end soon, but it
went on relentlessly. Then when Germany invaded France, he knew the
French schools would not reopen soon. In the fall of 1915 his parents
moved to Damascus with his younger brothers and sister, but he applied at
the Syrian Protestant College (soon to be known as the American
University of Beirut). Since he had never studied English, he decided to
enter as a sophomore instead of a junior, although it meant losing another year. — Ed.

My first occasion to visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa was in the summer of
1917. World War I had been raging for about three years. The Allied blockade
had completely cut off Syria and the Holy Land from the outside world — no mail,
no trade, no telegrams, no travelers. The Turks were ruling the area with an
iron hand. The military commander, Jamál Pá<u>sh</u>á, was ruthless, cruel,
unreasonable, and inefficient. He destroyed all in his way. Everybody was
under suspicion. Many of the aristocratic families of Syria found their sons
hanged in the public square. There was a shortage of everything. <span data-pg-empty=""> Nothing
could be obtained from abroad. There were no means to produce anything. Even food such as wheat
was scarce. Whatever little grain was raised was largely sequestered by the
Turkish army without payment to the farmers, and what was left of the crops
was decimated by swarms of locusts. Famine was rampant. Poverty was
everywhere.   

Such was the situation when I came to spend my summer vacation with my
uncle, Mírzá Ḥusayn Yazdí, in his home on Mt. Carmel. It was a
memorable summer nevertheless. For over two months I lived on God’s holy
mountain.   

Every evening before sunset I had the bounty of being with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
I would join other believers gathered in front of the Master’s house. The
entrance had an iron gate, and inside the gate there was a garden. We would
sit on the wall or parapet on each side of the wide gravel walk that led from
the garden gate to the steps and wait for Him. He would come out with a
cheerful and warm greeting, welcome all, and take His seat on the platform at
the head of the wide stairs. The sun would be going down, and I remember it
being very quiet in Haifa.   

Sometimes he sat relaxed and did not speak at all. But usually He spoke
in His commanding voice, looking straight ahead as if speaking to posterity.
He talked on Bahá’u’lláh, on Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings, and on significant
events in the history of the Faith. He told stories sprinkled with humor. <span data-pg-empty=""> And
often He spoke of the believers around the world and of their progress
in spreading the Faith. Then He became wistful. For <b>three</b> years He had heard
little or nothing from anywhere. The isolation and constraint weighed heavily
on Him.   

Now and then He addressed individuals in the audience, asking them about
their families, their work, their problems. Then He offered advice and help.
Toward the end He asked one of the believers to chant verses from the
Ma<u>th</u>naví of Bahá’u’lláh. When the chanting ended, the meeting was over.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá arose and entered the house. Dusk descended over Haifa.   

There were frequent trips to the Holy Shrine of the Báb. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
rode an old horse-drawn, bus-like vehicle up the mountain. The rest of us
walked the rocky road, past the Persian (or Eastern) Pilgrim House to the
terrace overlooking the city of Haifa and the blue bay beyond.[]() In the
distance lay the hazy outline of ‘Akká. We gathered on the terrace until
‘Abdu’l-Bahá appeared and entered the Shrine. He generally chanted the
Tablet of Visitation, but sometimes He asked Shoghi Effendi to chant it. When
it was over and the believers started to come out, He stood at the door with a
vial of rose water and put a little in each one’s hand.   

[^ ] The Pilgrim House referred to is located on Mt. Carmel near the Shrine of
the Báb. — Ed.

I remember following Him as he walked among the pines,<span data-pg-empty=""> past the Holy Shrine on Mt. Carmel, deeply absorbed in thought,
while the setting sun came down into the Mediterranean Sea. 

There were also trips, though less frequent, to ‘Akká and Bahjí to visit
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. 

There were times that summer when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went in the horse-drawn
carriage to Tiberias and the biblical Sea of Galilee. His purpose on these
trips was to oversee the grain crops which, under His supervision, had been
planted by the believers in the Jordan Valley.<span data-pg-empty=""> It was hot,
and He was tired, but nevertheless He did not hesitate to go.
I could “see” how hard it was for Him. I could also see His foresight in
planting these large crops, long before the need arose for them. He was
looking ahead, as He always did. When famine overtook the area, there was
rescue for the hungry and the poor. The Master had plenty of grain stored in
the ancient pits that the Romans had prepared a long time before. <span data-pg-empty=""> He
distributed it to everyone who needed it, Bahá’í, and non-Bahá’í alike. 

When the British arrived later, they also did not have enough provision;
an officer came and talked to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the situation. When asked
for His advice, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied, “I have grain.” 

“But, Master, for the British Army?” 

“I have grain — for the British Army, “ ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded. He was
later made a Knight of the British Empire for His services in relief of
distress and famine.[^] [^ ] See Balyuzi
“‘Abdu’l-Bahá”, 443-44 for an account of the knighting of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá on 17 April 1920. 

Another concern of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s that summer
was Jamál Pá<u>sh</u>á, who, as I mentioned before, was ruthless. <span data-pg-empty=""> He was
supposed to cross the Sinai Desert and the Suez Canal, then drive the British
out of Egypt. He never got there. But what he did was destroy the whole
country over which he passed. 

Jamál Pá<u>sh</u>á had heard charges from the Covenant-breakers that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was against the Turkish state. He was suspicious and made plans
to execute Him. <span data-pg-empty=""> The Master met with him on at least two
occasions. Commissions were sent to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to investigate His
activities.[^] [^ ] See Shoghi Effendi, “God Passes By”, 304, and Balyuzi, “‘Abdu’l-Bahá”,
412-14, for an account of Jamál Pá<u>sh</u>á. 

I would sometimes go into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s garden and talk with Ismá’il
Áqá. He was the gardener, an old man whom ‘Abdu’l-Bahá loved. I would
sit with him in his room there and talk. I happened to go to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
garden one day. Everyone was quiet, and I asked why. 

They said, “There is a commission of inquiry up in the Master’s room.” I
listened, and I could hear His clear, commanding voice through the open window
right above, talking to the Turkish commission with dignity, as if <u>He</u> were the
investigator and they the culprit. Although the Master was humble in many
ways, He never really bowed to anyone; He was proud in His nobility. Through
sensing His confidence, I acquired confidence and faith that He would be
spared. 

During these difficult and dangerous days He took time to write the
momentous Tablets of the Divine Plan, sometimes in Haifa, mostly in ‘Akká, thus
conferring upon the American Bahá’í community its world mission.[^] 

[^ ] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote the Tablets of the Divine Plan, which included
fourteen letters addressed to the Bahá’ís of the United States and
Canada, in 1916 and 1917. These letters, or tablets, constitute
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s charter, or master plan, for the promulgation of the
Faith throughout the world. See ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Tablets of the Divine
“Plan: Revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the North American Bahá’ís”, rev.
ed. (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1977). 

I was impressed that summer by the German colony, descendants of the
Germans who had come to Haifa in 1844 expecting the return of Christ. As I
looked down from the Shrine of the Báb on Mt. Carmel, I could see the
straight, steep path, a succession of flights of stone-and-masonry steps, that
were in line with the main street of the German colony. <span data-pg-empty=""> Their main avenue
looked straight up at the Shrine of the Báb on Mt. Carmel.
On their houses were inscriptions from the Bible.[^] 

[^ ] The German colony, known as the Society of the Temple, or Templers, had
cordial relations with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Who utilized their doctors and
called upon others to assist in business transactions pertaining to
acquiring land on Mt. Carmel. About twenty-five of the homes of the
Templers had religious inscriptions carved into the stone over their
doorways. One house, adjacent to a spot where Bahá’u’lláh once pitched
His tent, has the inscription “Der Herr ist nahe 1871” (“God is nigh
1871”). — Ed. 

There were also memorable little details such as eating at the table with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He ate very simply, but He insisted on others having the
proper amount of food. Quite often He would come behind the guests and talk to
them. He came behind me and said, “Why aren’t you eating?” I was shy; I was
hungry, but I did not dare eat. “Why aren’t you eating, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí?” He would
repeat. He would then put a large helping of rice on my plate. I had to eat
it! 

One day I was walking back from the business section of town. All the
streets were winding there, and the roads were dirt roads, not macadam. I was
going around a curved street up the hill toward the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
As I turned the corner, there He was. I saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with two of the
believers behind Him, walking down the hill. As was the custom, I stepped to
one side and bowed. He stopped and walked over to me, right in front of me,
and He looked me straight in the eyes. <span data-pg-empty=""> That is something I will never
forget — looking at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá face to face. 
(*photograph*) <span data-pg-empty=""> 

How to describe Him? I cannot do so adequately; I can only give a few
brushstrokes, hoping that together they may form a rough sketch of the Master. 

Imagine a strongly built man with a bearing at once majestic and genial.
Snowy white hair and flowing aba. Broad forehead, a strong intellect,
unswerving will, wondrous blue eyes that could look into your soul or melt into
infinite tenderness and reassurance. A face, now calm and meditative,
mirroring the very essence of peace, now radiant and full of life. A man of
contrasts, He was dominant, and yet He was humble. He was strong, and yet He
was tender. He was very loving and affectionate, and yet He could be very
stern. He was intensely human, keenly alive to the joys and sorrows of this
life. There was no one who felt more acutely that He did the sufferings of
humanity. 

He had a great sense of humor. I will share with you a few stories from
here and there, which I heard from others. One time, when He was in Paris, I
believe, some British journalists came to interview Him, and He answered their
questions in English. They were surprised and said, “Your English
pronunciation is very good.” 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá smiled and paced back and forth. (Quite often He walked
back and forth as He talked-even in His public speeches.) “Oh yes, “ He said,
and then He recited a few words such as “hippopotamus” and “rhinoceros”. “Yes, I
speak “difficult” English for you!” 

Another time He was in Palo Alto. This story was
told to Marion, my wife, by her favorite professor of English at Stanford,
Samuel Swayze Seward. <span data-pg-empty=""> Dr. Seward said he asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at dinner, after
he had spoken at Stanford University, “Who are the people most responsive to
your teachings?” 
‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied, “The Persians.”
    “Who are the least responsive?”
    “The Turks.”
    “What about the Americans?”

“Well — the Americans never want to stay on the same streetcar very long.
They always want to transfer. <span data-pg-empty="">But when they come to the Bahá’í Cause, they are firm and strong.”[^] 

[^ ] See Marion Carpenter [Yazdí’s] personal interview with Seward, 14
February 1924, in Yazdí, “Youth in the Vanguard”, 118-19, 167. 

Once Harlan Ober, one of the early believers, was asked by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
to go to India. Harlan had traveled all over the world for the Faith, but he
didn’t feel too keen about going to India at that time. Of course, he said
nothing, and he was perfectly willing to obey. A few days later ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said, “Harlan, you are going to America; you are going to the United States.” 

Harlan said, “But Master, I thought I was going to India.” 

‘Abdu’l-Bahá answered, “So did Columbus!” 

To return to my story: Summer vacation was almost over, and I went to see
my family in Damascus before going back to Beirut to graduate from the Syrian
Protestant College in May of 1918. After graduation I returned to Damascus.
The Allies ruled the seas. A ship stood in the Beirut harbor; I could see it
as I left. Bombardment was expected at any time. 

----

### THE END OF WORLD WAR I  

The war dragged on and on. There was nothing to do in Damascus. My
father had a small store, and I would help him with it. There was very little
business. I got a book and learned German just by reading and talking with the
soldiers who came to our store. <span data-pg-empty=""> I used to meet with the German soldiers. I
was trying to do something with my time, and I thought I could learn
the language and eventually study at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin. 

We lived on a terraced hillside above the city in an area called
“muhájirín”, meaning “immigrants.” It was so named because there was a
group of Turkish citizens who had emigrated there from European Turkey when the
Greeks had occupied their land. They preserved their own habits, costumes, and
language. It was a nice section, and I could look down over all of Damascus,
all the plain, then up at the mountains in the background. 

Every day we walked downtown because the streetcars were not running; they
did not have any coal or fuel to produce power. (The trains were running on
wood. I had the experience myself of climbing the Lebanese mountains in a
train powered by wood, and it was not exactly rewarding.) We had to walk “up
the hill at night. However, it was very pleasant, because Damascus, as my
father told us, was a little like Persia. It was still like the old, old
country. The walls were made of pressed mud and straw, and the wood was not
finished wood but just peeled trees put up instead of lumber. There were
beautiful orchards, and when I walked, I could see all those trees laden with
fruits. The weather was nice. I actually enjoyed my stay there. So we went
up and down, counting the days, not knowing when the war would end. 

One evening after sunset we had finished dinner and were up on the little
veranda when we heard a loud noise like an explosion — cannon shots. We looked
out ahead and saw a big fire. <span data-pg-empty=""> Then there were more explosions and more noise.
We realized that the British were bombarding the military section of Damascus.
At last the British had come. We had been hoping for deliverance from the
Turkish yoke. 

That was the beginning of the British occupation. Instead of the Turkish
army’s crossing the Suez Canal, the British had come and conquered Jerusalem.
Before this time we had had no news. All we heard was fabricated by the
Turkish authorities. This came as a complete surprise. What would happen to
us, we did not know, but somehow we were not afraid. After awhile, the
bombardment stopped; we went to bed and went to sleep. 

Before dawn we awoke to strange noises. First we heard the Turkish and
German soldiers filing away, right in front of our door, on a little tortuous
path, and escaping up the hill to the north. Then we heard a funny, squeaky
noise, which we found out later was from the “Tin Lizzies, “ the little Model-T
Fords, going up the hill. We had never heard sounds like that before. That
morning I was bold enough to go out and walk downtown to see what was going
on. There were Australian cavalrymen with their big hats, riding up the street
eating tomatoes. I had never seen anybody eating tomatoes as fruit before. I
waved at them, and they look at me suspiciously. Then I spoke English, and
they brightened up, responded, and were very friendly. 

Our great concern was Haifa. <span data-pg-empty=""> What had happened there? For a time we had
no word. We were very anxious. But soon the news came: General Allenby and the British had occupied
Haifa. There is a long story behind that. In short, the British Intelligence
Service, headed by Major Tudor-Pole, one who was very friendly to the
Bahá’ís, if not a Bahá’í himself, had uncovered a message telling that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in danger, that Jamál Pá<u>sh</u>á had vowed to crucify Him,
and destroy the Holy Tombs and all the sacred buildings of the Bahá’í Faith
before the British came. Immediately, the wires were busy between London and
Cairo as the British arrived in Palestine. Forces were set in motion to take
the town by surprise. General Allenby was to come around the promontory,
around Mt. Carmel and into Haifa, and flank the Bahá’í properties. The
British at once put a cordon of soldiers around the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
took steps to protect Him. All the generals and officers came to pay their
respects to Him. And thus He was saved. We learned this fact later; we did
not know at the time how close we came to losing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. 

The doors to the outside world were opened up. Now we could see ahead.
We, too, were free and could make plans for the rest of our lives. There was
much thinking and counting of pennies. I had been working for the Public Works
Department of the new Arab government. I had studied civil engineering and was
hired as a draftsman. I was able to work for several months and save a little
money to help me get started, but it was not enough. <span data-pg-empty="">
News got to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá through my uncle, Mírzá Ḥusayn, and the
Master offered me one hundred pounds, which in those days was worth about five
hundred dollars.[^] That made it possible for me to go. I did not waste any
time. In the fall of 1919 I went to Haifa to say farewell to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
I was on my way to Europe (Switzerland, then Germany) for my graduate studies.
I was twenty years old. 

[^ ] This gift from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was gratefully returned to Shoghi Effendi,
the new Guardian, soon after ‘Alí was employed by the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company on completion of his graduate studies at the University
of California at Berkeley. — Ed.


This was to be my last experience with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. 

----

### FAREWELL TO THE MASTER  

I was in Haifa for two or three days. Just before I left, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
called me to His room. I was there alone with Him; the only other person was
Shoghi Effendi, who was in and out. The Master asked me to sit down, and He
directed Shoghi Effendi to bring me some tea. As He spoke to me, He gave me
instructions on how to live. He told me He had hopes for me. He said, “You
are a good boy, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí.” 

Then Shoghi Effendi brought the tea. They serve tea in glasses there,
boiling hot. I took the tea, and I tried to drink it, but I could not.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Drink. Drink your tea.” <span data-pg-empty=""> So I had to drink it. It didn’t
matter! 

At the very end He gave me His blessing. Then He stood up and beckoned me
to Him. I went to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and He put His arms around me and kissed me
on both cheeks. 

I never saw Him again. but the tablets, or letters, that the beloved
Master revealed on my behalf followed me to Europe and America. One of the
tablets, in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own handwriting, introduced me to the German
Bahá’ís: “O ye friends of God! His honor <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí is one of the firm
friends; exercise toward him love and kindness.” To the Bahá’ís in the
United States ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent two introductions. In the fall of 1920 He
wrote to Roy C. Wilhelm: 
His honor, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí, is going to America. He is a
       youth of good manners and temperament and is of an accepted
       family at the Threshold of God. Therefore, you will do your
       best to help him in managing his affairs.


On 8 October 1920 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote, in His own hand, to William H.
Randall: 
Jináb-i-<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí, the distinguished son of
       Ḥájí Áqá Muḥammad, is a sensible and cultured
       young man of good behavior. He will be going to America to
       complete the courses of sciences and arts which he has been
       studying in Berlin. Probably he will remain about two years
       in America. Thou shouldst treat him with the utmost
       consideration and kindness.


On 9 December ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote again, this time to Mrs. Ruth W. Randall,
regarding the selection of a suitable university for me to attend. <span data-pg-empty=""> Finally, in
late 1920 or early 1921, I was greatly strengthened and inspired as I began my
life in the United States to receive a tablet from the Master inscribed to “The
spiritual son, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí, upon him be the Glory of God, the All-Glorious:” 
O <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí who are dear to the spiritually minded.
           Render thanks unto God that in this blessed
       age thou hast stepped forth into the world of existence,
       been nursed from the breast of the love of God and hast been
       reared in the bosom of divine guidance, and that now with
       the permission of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and by His leave thou art
       proceeding to America to study the sciences. <span data-pg-empty=""> Thy father is
       here with us at the Holy Threshold, and we both pray on thy
       behalf and beseech for thee the assistance and favor of the
       Blessed Perfection. And upon thee be His glory.[^]

### REFLECTION 

Looking back, as I have so many, many times in my life, I can see that the
passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá marked the end of an era. He was a man passionately
devoted to a single goal: to spread the teachings of His Father, Bahá’u’lláh;
to bring people together; to establish the brotherhood of man on earth in “fact
as well as in principle. He had spent His whole life in the midst of severe
and uninterrupted persecution and imprisonment, yet He had not flinched. With
His brilliant mind, His indomitable courage, and His unbounded devotion He had
directed the spread of the Faith to the peoples of Europe and America, while at
the same time protecting this Faith in the country of its origin
from concentrated and merciless attack. <span data-pg-empty=""> Nothing stopped Him — not His enemies,
the military, disaster, dangers, the Turkish authorities, the difficulties that
met His efforts — nothing ever deflected Him from His purpose. And yet it was
not easy, for despite His high station, He was also intensely human, and He
suffered a great deal. 

He was often <b>very</b> happy and always asked the Bahá’ís to be happy: “Be
happy! Be happy!” That was His counsel to the believers, and he set the
example. But there were times when I would see Him with the burdens of the
whole world upon His shoulders. 

There is something we should never forget, something I learned from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá: His life was not really His life alone; it was the life of
every one of us, an example to every one of us. If we always keep His life in
mind, I think it will help us find our way. 

We have a new generation of Bahá’ís coming in from the outside and a new
generation growing up from the inside. They know what they have read in the
books. But do they know that this is a living Faith? Do they truly realize
that the Manifestation of God has actually appeared and initiated a new era?
Do they know that people have lived and worked and died for the Cause? Are
they fully aware that the Bahá’í Faith is not just something extraneous,
something beautiful, logical, just, and fair? Do they know that it is part
and parcel of our blood, our very life? 

I cannot help wondering what the world would be like if people flocked to
the teachings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá <span data-pg-empty=""> and followed His example, if men and women all over the world arose in
ever-increasing numbers and made His way of life their own — ten thousand, ten
million, a hundred million people — each pursuing His goal with zest and
confidence. <span data-pg-empty=""> What <b>would</b> the world be like? And what would the individual’s
life be like, transformed by the example of our Master?

   <h2 class="title"> PART TWO — Recollections of Shoghi Effendi 
   <h3 class="author"> ‘Alí M. Yazdí 

It has <span data-pg-empty=""> been a blessing for me beyond measure to have personally known
Shoghi Effendi, the extraordinary grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, during the years
of our youth, before he became the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, as well as
after. 

Shoghi Effendi was very close to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Master always
treated him a little differently from other people, even when he was a child.
He was devoted to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. From his earliest childhood, from the very
beginning of his life, he was dedicated to the Faith.

### MEMORIES OF SHOGHI EFFENDI IN RAMLEH 

I first met Shoghi Effendi in 1910 when he came to Ramleh, shortly after
the Master came. He was thirteen, and I was eleven. <span data-pg-empty=""> I had heard about him but
had never seen him before. Now, in Ramleh, he went to the same school I did: the
French Brothers’ School. We slowly started to get acquainted; you know how
children are. Then we got to know each other better. I would see him at
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s house, and gradually we became friends. Even as a child he
was always dignified, but he was also friendly. <span data-pg-empty=""> He was always full of
zest — always energetic and eager, always full of life. 

The first thing of importance that happened during his stay in Ramleh
proved to be a shattering experience. When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá planned to go to the
United States, He wanted to take Shoghi Effendi with Him, along with a few
other believers. <span data-pg-empty=""> Shoghi Effendi was in seventh heaven. He had heard so much
about America, and he longed to be with the Master as He traveled throughout
North America and gave the Message. He looked forward with great anticipation to the experience. 

The day before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left, Shoghi Effendi came to see me and
asked, “<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí, “ — he almost always called me <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-‘Alí — “do you want to go
to the ship with me and see my cabin?” 

I said, “Surely!” So, with some other believers, we took the electric train
to Alexandria and then to the harbor. Before us was the <b>Cedric</b>, a White Star
Liner. 

It was a beautiful ship, one of two that plied regularly between
Alexandria and New York, and stopped only at Naples. Shoghi Effendi and I went
on the boat, and he took me upstairs and showed me his stateroom, the dining
room, and everything on the ship. He was extremely happy, and so was I very
happy for him. I made him promise to write to me when he got to America, and
he said he would. 

The next day, 25 March 1912, was the day of departure. Earlier I
explained how ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walked silently to the train and how he went to
Alexandria and took the ship.[^] Shoghi Effendi went with Him. In Naples
there were physical examinations; eyes were tested, for no one could enter the
United States with trachoma. The Italian doctors said that Shoghi Effendi had
this infection. He had never had trouble with his eyes. There were no signs
of trachoma, yet they insisted he must leave the ship. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was very
sad. He said, “They think we are Turks.” Italy was still at war with Turkey.
Through this, and perhaps other machinations, Shoghi Effendi was sent back.
When he returned to Ramleh, the doctors said firmly that he did <b>not</b> have any
problem whatever. Shoghi Effendi was heartbroken. He wanted to be with his
beloved Master, and he wanted to be in America and see the teachings of the
Faith he loved spread all over the
country. <span data-pg-empty=""> That dream was denied him. I saw how he lost weight and actually
became sick because he was depressed. It took quite a while before he regained
his health.[^] 

[^ ] See pp. 20, 22. — Ed. 
[^ ] Shoghi Effendi’s wife, Rúḥíyyih Rabbání, explains in “The Priceless
Pearl” ([London: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1969], 19) that Dr. Amin
Faríd, one of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s secretaries, was party to the
machinations that prevented Shoghi Effendi from accompanying the Master
to North America. — Ed.


After ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels in the United States and Europe, He
returned to Ramleh for five months. Shoghi Effendi, who had been in Haifa part
of that time, came to be with Him. On 2 December 1913 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left
Alexandria to return to the Holy Land. I did not see Shoghi Effendi again for
almost three years. 

----

### MEMORIES OF SHOGHI EFFENDI IN BEIRUT 

At the Syrian Protestant College, Shoghi Effendi and I were both students.
There was a group of Bahá’í students who met to discuss the teachings. That
was our extracurricular activity and our time for comradeship. Shoghi Effendi
was one of the group, and so was I. These students were mostly Persians who
were marooned there. <span data-pg-empty=""> They could not get home because of World War I and the
blockade of the coast; during the summers they went to Haifa and spent their
vacations on Mt. Carmel. There was an anteroom to the Shrine of the Báb that was
assigned to them, and they spent very happy summers there. When I was in
Haifa, I greatly enjoyed being with Shoghi Effendi and with them. 

At the college Shoghi Effendi was always jolly, optimistic, and hopeful.
He had a wonderful personality. All of a sudden he would burst forth with loud
laughter. Or sometimes a smile would break on his face. He had a very small
mouth; beautiful, expressive eyes; and very regular, handsome features. He was
bouncy. He just bounced. 

At college we were in the same dormitory. Shoghi Effendi’s room was right across the hall from mine. <span data-pg-empty=""> I have stated that there
was a shortage of everything, including food, which led to famine. I remember
being downtown and seeing women dying on the streets. No one paid any
attention to them. I did not go back again; I preferred staying on campus, for
it was terrible to see those people dying when no one was able to do anything
for them. <span data-pg-empty=""> Luckily, because of President Bliss of the college, even though
America was in the war, rations were allowed to come to the college. The main reason for this was
that the Syrian Protestant College trained doctors, engineers, and so
on — professionals who were useful to the Turkish authorities. We were not
actually deprived of anything, but we had not luxuries either. 

From time to time Shoghi Effendi would have things sent from Haifa. He
would receive good, brown, home-baked bread; honey; dried fruits; and nuts.
the fruits from Haifa and Lebanon were absolutely delicious. Shoghi Effendi
would invite me to his room, and the two of us would sit together, feasting,
talking, and enjoying ourselves. He was always very generous. 

We would converse on many subjects. Actually, our relationship was now of
two young men, two personal friends, as we were beginning our life on our own,
and we had much to share. We often talked to each other about the future. His
vision was always of the Faith spreading all over the world and of everybody
serving the Cause; these were his only ambitions. We shared a common goal of
personal service to the Faith. He himself did not know he was going to be the
Guardian. Even at Oxford, where I later visited him, he never gave any
indication that he knew he was to be the Guardian.[^] 

[^ ] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appointed Shoghi Effendi the Guardian of the Bahá’í
Faith in His Will and Testament, but Shoghi Effendi did not learn about
the appointment until his grandfather passed away in 1921.<span data-pg-empty=""> — Ed. 

Though Shoghi Effendi was of holy lineage, and I was a member of an old
pioneer family in the Faith, we forgot about that and were just two young men
being very happy together.[^] We both had logical minds, and we both liked to
discuss things analytically. We also enjoyed sharing our creativity and
vision. These were aspects of our relationship then and later. 

[^ ] A pioneer in the Bahá’í context is one who leaves his or her home to
serve the Bahá’í Faith in another country. — Ed.

### MEMORIES OF SHOGHI EFFENDI IN HAIFA 

In 1917 I spent the summer vacation in the home of my uncle, Mírzá
Ḥusayn Yazdí, on Mt. Carmel. The trip from Beirut to Haifa was something I
will never forget. I had never been on a horse before, and yet I had to go
from Beirut down the coast by horseback. There were other Persian students
riding too, but they all knew how to ride. 

Despite my inexperience, I managed fine. The horse was not exactly an
Arabian steed, but we trotted along until just before Tyre. I remembered
something about the land of Tyre in the Bible. At that point we had to go over
steep mountains. <span data-pg-empty=""> There was only hard rock, and we were high up looking down,
way down, onto the waves of the Mediterranean beating against the rocks — I not
knowing what I was doing.But I trusted the horse, and I prayed all along the way. 

There were compensations. We traveled by day and by night. It was
strange to pass through the fields right along the seashore as people had done
in Biblical days, and to see women working through the night, gathering
vegetables. The fresh summer night air made it a delightful experience. Best
of all, we made it safely to ‘Akká. 

There were compensations. We traveled by day and by night. It was
‘Akká is an old city paved with stones. <span data-pg-empty=""> By the sea-
shore there was an old fortress made of stone, brick, and masonry blocks. It
was built out over the ocean with holes in the walls through which guns could
be fired. The waves would beat against the walls. There I looked down and
could see the house where I was to stay that night. Later I heard about all
the things that had happened in that same house in the history of the Faith.[^] 

[^ ] It is not known to which house ‘Alí is referring. — Ed.
It was exciting. <span data-pg-empty=""> I was always quite a romantic child and youth; I liked to let
my imagination run away. That night I slept on the floor, exhausted. 

The next day we went to Haifa and were in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
During the summer I was frequently in the company of Shoghi Effendi. He was
part of the group — not just with me; we were all together, enjoying one
another’s company. 

----

### COMMUNICATIONS AFTER WORLD WAR I 

Shoghi Effendi graduated from the Syrian Protestant College the same year
I did.[^] He went back to Haifa; I went to Damascus. Later on, when the way
was opened for communication and travel, Shoghi Effendi was exceedingly happy.
His diary and his letters at that time are a truly remarkable record of what
the Bahá’ís were doing, as well as of his own feelings. They show how
excited he was, after the long spell of silence and isolation, to see the mail
flooding in from all over the world — from the United States, from Germany, from
France, India, Burma. Letters came with news of the Faith; telegrams
expressed the joy of the believers that they could again communicate with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. <span data-pg-empty=""> Shoghi Effendi was thrilled by all of these greetings as his
letter of 26 December 1918 shows: 

[^ ] Shoghi Effendi and ‘Alí Yazdí graduated on 15 May 1918. — Ed.
Every day carries with it its fresh tidings and happy
       news. From the Far-Eastern land, the center of news has
       shifted today to Persia, in the Middle East, and thence to
       the extreme West in the U.S. of America. Many telegrams
       have arrived, and each contributed its share of consolation
       and solace. From the dear land of Persia, the doors of
       which are still practically closed, in a material sense to
       the face of the Beloved, this bit of good news is wired:
       “Good news made all extremely happy; friends well safe and
       united; desiring only Thy will.” From France a similar cable
       is at hand expressing joy at the receipt of the Beloved’s
       cable and conveying love to all. From Boston and Chicago
       alike the news arrive[s] that the friends rejoice at
       ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s deliverance, supplicate Tablets, and even
       beg the Master to come to their shores. 
We shall wait to see the response of the Beloved. 
Early this morning I was ushered to His Holy presence,
       and there facing the Beloved on the sofa, enwrapped in His
       mantle with masses of supplications scattered around Him, I
       sat, pen in my hand, putting down the words that flowed from
       His lips. A Tablet was revealed to Miss Juliet Thompson of
       New York....[^] 

[^ ] Juliet Thompson (d. 1956) was an American portrait artist who learned of
the Faith from May Bolles [Maxwell] when she was studying art in Paris.
Her vivid recollections of her meetings with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are recorded
in “The Diary of Juliet Thompson” (Los Angeles: Kalimát, 1983). — Ed. 

Another Tablet was addressed to Aḥmad Yazdí [an uncle
       of ‘Alí Yazdí] of Port Sa‘íd....[^] 

[^ ] Diary-letter, Shoghi Effendi to Aḥmad Sohrab, 26 December 1918, copy in
Marion Yazdí Papers (hereafter cited as Yazdí Papers). <span data-pg-empty=""> 

Now the friends were again free to teach the Faith. My father received
permission to come to Haifa. Shoghi Effendi described the visit in letter of
13 February 1919: 
The call of the Beloved bidding the friends of God to
       arise...has resounded throughout all regions....The city of
       Damascus...has awakened to the spirit of the new age. The
       prominent figure among its friends [Ḥájí Muḥammad
       Yazdí, the father of ‘Alí Yazdí] has attained to the court
       of the Beloved’s presence and has brought with him...good
       news...This morning he was ushered to the Beloved’s presence
       and the first thing he did after seizing the hem of the
       Beloved’s garment and repeatedly kissing it, was to offer a
       supplication from an erudite Arab, a native of Medina, an
       influential and responsible personage in Damascus, an
       authority in the Muslim creed who had been attracted and
       moved to write to the Beloved....In short the news of our
       beloved and dear visitor, Áqá Ḥájí Muḥammad
       Yazdí was refreshing, numerous, and significant. With a
       smile and a nod of appreciation the Beloved greeted every
       bit of news and was glad to know that a reaction to the
       passiveness and inactivity of the past had set in. “Deliver
       the Divine message with prudence and wisdom” was the
       Beloved’s recommendation to the teachers who are serving in
       these regions. Having said this, He arose, again welcomed
       our guest...leaving us with our friend whose source of news
       and glad tidings seemed inexhaustible.[^] 

[^ ] Diary-letter, Shoghi Effendi to Aflat, 13 February 1919, copy
in Yazdí Papers. 

Two days later Shoghi Effendi wrote enthusiastically that the pilgrims
were arriving as before the war: 
Tonight, around the Master’s table for supper sat
       Messrs. <span data-pg-empty="">Aḥmad Yazdí, Ḥájí Muḥammad Yazdí,
       Mírzá Ḥusayn Yazdí [‘Alí Yazdí’s uncle, father, and a
       second uncle, respectively], Áqá Muḥammad Taqí,
       three of the Parsee friends of ‘Adasíyyih who have
       recently arrived, Badí’ Effendi, and my father. The Master
       was tired and did not converse long. That night the
       recollection of those prewar banquets wherein believers from
       every part would gather came to my mind, for new faces I
       saw, and delicious dishes were placed.... 
Major Tudor-Pole due to a slight indisposition has had
       to postpone his departure from Cairo....
       When he arrives, our joy will reach its utmost....[^]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá worked all hours. One morning Shoghi Effendi was sleeping
when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called him to get to work. This tender description was
written later that day: 
Early this morning I was awakened by a gentle knock at
       my door, followed by the sweet voice of the Beloved calling
       me to rise from my sleep, to shake off my drowsiness, and to
       attend to my work.[^] 

[^ ] Diary-letter, Shoghi Effendi to Aḥmad Sohrab, 21 February 1919, copy in
Yazdí Papers. We have used house style for capitalization, spelling, and
the transliteration of Persian and Arabic words.

‘You could see the Faith was Shoghi Effendi’s life; his joy was service to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He kept repeating all the time, “I am in the service of my
Beloved.” He was happy in those days and intent on the future of the Faith. 

But Shoghi Effendi was also aware that all the Persian students of our
group were leaving, some for
Persia, some for Europe, some for America. <span data-pg-empty=""> He wrote of the separations in his
diary on 24 August and noted that I was coming to Haifa to say good-bye to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá: 
This week has been, viewed from one aspect, a sad and
       depressing one. It has witnessed the scattering of friends
       who during the war and prior to it have been for years held
       closely and affectionately together by bonds of fellowship
       and common interest. The student Bahá’í group at the
       American University — that company of young, brilliant,
       active, and upright men, which has all throughout the war
       retained, notwithstanding its vicissitudes and blows, its
       cohesion, is now splitting up, its numbers mostly graduates
       of that university departing from that common center....Mr.
       ‘Alí Yazdí is just starting from Damascus to Haifa
       where, after meeting the Beloved, he will proceed to Berlin
       to engage in higher studies. 
Sad has been the farewell..., but the idea that these
       young men, enlightened and active as they are, may one day
       each in his own sphere of action render a service to the
       Cause, affords sufficient consolation for the hearts that
       remain behind.[^]

### STUDIES IN GERMANY 

I left Haifa by train to go to Port Sa‘íd where I would take the ship to
Switzerland and Germany. Shoghi Effendi came to the station in Haifa to see me
off. <span data-pg-empty=""> He sat in the compartment until the train was ready to leave; then he
said good-bye, and he asked me to write to him. It was the end of August 1919 — the last time I was to be in
Haifa until 1928, after my marriage to Marion Carpenter when we both made the
pilgrimage and were in Shoghi Effendi’s presence. 

There were five other young Bahá’ís, one of whom was older than the rest
of us, who had been students at Beirut and were now being sent by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Stuttgart to contact the believers after the war. We all had
passage on a small, old Italian boat of the Lloyd Triestino Company. <span data-pg-empty=""> The route
was from Port Sa‘íd to Alexandria to Venice. In Alexandria I went to the offices and arranged a
transfer to a new ship, which was just ready to sail. The others followed
suit. We had the most beautiful trip along the Adriatic by the Dalmatian
coast, with its sunny little hamlets and islands, to Trieste. In Venice we
were marooned for a couple of weeks with passport difficulties; things were not
easy right after the war. I stopped for a short time in Switzerland. But the
university had already begun, and I went on to Germany. 

I studied for a year at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin and spent a
summer in Stuttgart. It was a wonderful Bahá’í summer. There I came to know
Consul and Mrs. Albert Schwarz. He died in 1931, but she served the Faith
actively for many years and died much later. They were both remarkable people.
They took me to their house many times. The Bahá’ís there were most kind.
The southern Germans were very friendly, mild, and loving. 

There was also another family with whom I became close. The head of that
family, the father, was Herr Hauff. He had a factory outside the city that made
photographic equipment. He was quite well-to-do. He had built a large house
that was a replica of an old castle. He invited me to stay there. His family
were all Bahá’ís; he was the only one who was not a believer. He offered me
some of the choicest wine from his cellar and was rather shocked when I turned
it down. He could not understand such a thing. 

Herr Hauff and his wife had two daughters and a
son. <span data-pg-empty=""> The older daughter, Johanna Hauff, was a very sweet, lovely girl, and we
became good friends. When I was in Berlin, she and her father came to see me,
and we went to some of the interesting places together. Later I read in “Star
of the West”, in 1922, that she was in Haifa at the time of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
passing.[^] 

[^ ] See “Letters telling of the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Star of the West
12 (2 March 1922): 296-99, for two letters dated 28 November 1921 and 3
December 1921 from Johanna Hauff, at Haifa, Palestine, to her parents in
Stuttgart, Germany.

Germany was a marvelous experience for me, but all of Shoghi Effendi’s
friends had gone, and he was left behind — until 1920. But he was happy in his
work. <span data-pg-empty=""> 

He was busy translating all the incoming mail in French and English into
Persian and translating the tablets revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in reply to
these people. He was very much occupied and extremely happy. I corresponded
with him now and then. 

After I arrived in Germany, I received this letter from Shoghi Effendi
written 9 December 1919: 
My dearest ‘Alí 

> For a long time have I awaited your letters as I was in
       the dark as to your whereabouts. But now that your father
       has come for a few days from Damascus, I secured your
       address and am sending you herewith some news of the Holy
       Land. 
The Beloved is in the best of health and so are the
       friends and pilgrims. Your dear and devoted father is as
       ever warmhearted, loving, rosy-cheeked, and in full bloom.
       Your brother is studying at the S.P.C.[^] and all runs
       smoothly. I was told last night that he is growing
       wonderfully in height and his studies above par. 

[^ ] ‘Alí Yazdí’s brother, ‘Abdu’l-Raḥím Yazdí (named by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
for their grandfather ‘Abdu’r-Raḥím), was studying at the Syrian
Protestant College, now called the American University of Beirut. Later
he served for many years as the chairman of the National Spiritual
Assembly of the Bahá’ís of North East Africa. — Ed. 
As to myself, the same work and the same room. 
So please write me and forget me not as I do not and
       cannot forget the dear <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>! 
Yours affectionately
 Shoghi  

Eight days later he wrote that fifty pilgrims had arrived from many parts
of the world. <span data-pg-empty=""> He enclosed a tablet revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá commending me to
the believers in Germany: 
Dearest ‘Alí!
Your letter from Stuttgart dated Nov. 27 is at hand. I
       exposed its contents to the Master, and I secured this
       Tablet for you in His own handwriting addressed to the
       German friends. I herewith enclose it.[^] 

[^ ] See pages 42-43 for the text and facsimile of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s 17
December 1919 tablet concerning ‘Alí Yazdí addressed to the German
Bahá’ís. — Ed. 
Your dear father is here, and we exchange the news of
       your letters to me and to him. He is well and happy. I
       trust you have received my letter to you dated Dec. 8, which
       I sent to the Technische Hochschule and in which I enclosed
       some diary letters of mine which I thought might interest
       you. 
We are exceedingly busy here. Some fifty pilgrims,
       Arabs, Kurds, Persians, Americans, Europeans, and Japanese.
       How we miss you and the dear Trio, Bakers & Co.; I have
       written them letters, and I wonder whether they have been
       received. Áqá Mírzá Muḥammad-Báqir <u>Kh</u>án is on
       his way to Haifa and is now in India.[^] <span data-pg-empty=""> 

[^ ] With “Bakers & Co.” Shoghi Effendi is making a play on words using the
name of Áqá Mírzá Muḥammad-Báqir <u>Kh</u>án. — Ed. 
Give please my love to all the brothers and sisters in
       Stuttgart,
I am ever
 your brother
 Shoghi 
Most admirable Tablets have been revealed for Consul and

### SHOGHI EFFENDI IN PARIS 

The time came when Shoghi Effendi, too, would leave Haifa. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
wanted him to continue his studies. However, the hard work had broken his
health. The Master sent him to a sanitorium just outside of Paris to rest,
undergo treatment, and recuperate.[^] He was not to open a book while he was
there. His postcard, written 8 May 1920, gives some idea of what he was going
through at this time: 

[^ ] Maison d’Hydrotherapie et de Convalescence du Parc de Neuilly, 6,
Boulevard du Chateau. — Ed. 
Dearest ‘Alí! 
I have not forgotten you, but do you know and realize
       what crisis I have passed and into what state of health I
       have fallen! <span data-pg-empty=""> For a month I have stayed and am still staying
       in this “maison de convalescence” away from Paris and its
       clamor in bed until noon, receiving...treatment and
       following the Master’s instructions not to open a book during my stay
       in this place. Be sure, dear friend, that your place in my
       heart is ever reserved and warm! I wish, when recovered, I
       could come to see you. But I am afraid this is not
       possible. Your dear father had gone to Port Sa‘íd for a time
       when I left Haifa. The Master is in splendid health.
       Fourteen American pilgrims have arrived. The Holy Land is
       astir! 
Shoghi [^] <span data-pg-empty=""> 

[^ ] Postcard, Shoghi Rabbání to ‘Alí [Yazdí], 8 May 1920, Yazdí Papers.

On 28 June 1920 Shoghi Effendi wrote that he had almost recovered and was
waiting for instructions from the Master: 
My dear unforgettable ‘Alí! 
Your letter and the good news of you imparted by
       <u>Gh</u>ulám-‘Alí made me wish or yearn to come to you and see
       you for a few days now that I am better and almost fully
       recovered Shoghi [^] I shall wait and see the turn of events before
       I decide to pass a sojourn with you in Berlin. Now that I
       have recovered after three-months regime, hydrotherapy, and
       electric treatment, I am impatient to plunge again in a
       valuable, profitable work, to build the structure for my
       future and whether I shall resume my work in Haifa or go to
       England for two years study — it all depends upon the
       Master’s will, which shall be communicated to me within a
       fortnight.

I have deplored the hard financial situation you are in,
       and I really feel with you. I have just written home and
       exposed your situation to the Holy Mother, and I trust
       something will be done to remedy the situation.[^] Dr.

[^ ] After World War I Germany was in ruins, reparations and pensions had to
be paid, money was short, inflation was out of control, jobs — especially
for students — were scarce, and the cost of living was expensive. ‘Alí had
left Haifa with faith, his earnings as a draftsman, and one hundred
English pounds that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had given him. High university fees
and saving money for going to the United States to study irrigation
engineering, as the Master had directed, left ‘Alí virtually with no
funds. — Ed.

Later in his life Shoghi Effendi went to Switzerland during the summers to
climb mountains and walk a lot. He loved the outdoors and the mountains, and
he needed time with nature, because all his work was desk work. But in 1920
his stay in Paris was only a stop on his way to England and Oxford University.

### SHOGHI EFFENDI IN ENGLAND 

Shoghi Effendi was happy with the Bahá’ís in England. He saw Dr. John
Esslemont, whom he had known the previous winter in Haifa, and they struck up a
great friendship.[^] Dr. Esslemont had tuberculosis.
<span data-pg-empty=""> Shoghi Effendi used to go to his private sanatorium in Bournemouth; they
had meals together, and they enjoyed talking. 

[^ ] Dr. John E. Esslemont (1874-1925) heard of the Faith in England in 1914
and was instantly struck by the beauty and significance of it. He
rendered many services to the Faith, distinguishing himself through his
literary contributions, most notably his well-known introductory text
“Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era” (5th rev. ed.[Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í
Publishing Trust, 1980]) and through his collaboration with Shoghi
Effendi. After Esslemont’s death, Shoghi Effendi appointed him a Hand of
the Cause of God. — Ed. 

Then he went to Oxford, and there, of course, things were different
because he had to study very hard. <span data-pg-empty=""> He was working for a special certificate,
not for a Master of Arts or a higher degree. He was studying special
subjects — English, economics, history of religion, and so on, as described in
the letter below. <span data-pg-empty=""> He was not taking required courses for an advanced degree.
the best way to understand his feelings at that time is through the letters he
wrote: 
Balliol College
5.10.20
? 
Dear ‘Alí: 
Your letter reached me at a time I was immersed heart and
       soul in my manifold preparations for entrance at Balliol
       College, Oxford. I am fearfully anxious and occupied, but
       your letter absorbed my interest and diverted it from this
       phase for a time. I am glad and extremely sad in receiving
       your letter — glad at the knowledge that at last my efforts
       have proved partially successful and <b>some</b> pecuniary help has
       been extended to you. I wished, dear ‘Alí, to have had
       enough money at my disposal to share it with you! I
       immediately wrote to Mrs. George and exposed the case fully.
       I hope you will soon and easily sail. I am so grieved at
       the sudden turn of events and the complications and cost of
       travel have only marred the brightness caused by the
       knowledge that some financial help has been finally
       extended. 
I really wondered and got even angry at the delay and
       silence following my letter which I sent home concerning
       you. I wonder whether you have experienced brighter
       developments since you wrote me your last letter. I assure
       you, dear friend, that if some are free from pecuniary
       anxieties, they are nevertheless subject to another set of
       various physical, intellectual, and social drawbacks and
       preoccupations. Do you believe me when I say that I, the
       grandson of the Master, have been victim of painful
       experiences, sometimes of bitter disappointments, and always
       of constant anxieties — all justified — for my immediate work
       and future? <span data-pg-empty=""> If you have spent of late painful and trying
       times, my share of these troubled hours is by no means much less and
       my burden much lighter. 
My field of study is so <u>vast</u>, I have to acquire, master,
       and digest so many facts, courses, and books — all essential,
       all indispensable to my future career in the Cause. <span data-pg-empty=""> The
       very extent of this immense field is enough to discourage,
       excite, and overwhelm such a young and inexperienced beginner as myself.
       Think of the vast field of Economics; of social conditions
       and problems; of the various religions of the past, their
       histories and their principles and their force; the
       acquisition of a sound and literary ability in English to be
       served for translation purposes; the mastery of public
       speaking so essential to me, all these and a dozen more — all
       to be sought, acquired, and digested![^] 

[^ ] In a question-and-answer session following a talk on 2 November 1975,
     when ‘Alí Yazdí was asked whether Shoghi Effendi was a public speaker,
     Yazdí explained that Shoghi Effendi was intensely interested in the great
     speakers at Oxford. However, Shoghi Effendi himself did not speak
     publicly on any occasion as far as he knew. Shoghi Effendi felt,
     perhaps, that that was not his greatest contribution. — Ed.

Prayer, faith, perseverance and effort will alone do it.
       Praying for your success from all my heart!

### MEMORIES OF SHOGHI EFFENDI AT OXFORD 

In the fall of 1920 I left Germany and went to London, where I wired
Shoghi Effendi to tell him I was going to the United States. He immediately
telegraphed, “You don’t mean to tell me you are going to America without coming
to see me.” I wrote a note, and he answered by postcard on 3 November 1920: 
Oxford 45 Broad St.

My dear ‘Alí. 
When I received your telegram, I wondered to
       what address I should forward my answer. <span data-pg-empty=""> Now that I have
       been informed I hasten to tell you how glad I would be to
       meet you, shake hands with you, and perform the ceremony of
       “muṣáfiḥih”.[^] I am bound with my lectures and courses
       and feel sometimes depressed. I shall be your host when you
       come to see me. I don’t know how you have managed for your
       traveling expenses.

     and touching the right cheeks and then the left cheeks. In his postcard

[^ ] Postcard, Shoghi [Effendi] to ‘Alí Yazdí, 3 November 1920, Yazdí Papers. 

With this invitation I went to Oxford and stayed in Shoghi Effendi’s rooms
and spent a couple of nights there. He took me all over the university,
showing me the sights and unburdening his soul. There, again, we were two
young men, one of holy lineage and the other from a family that had long been
in the service of the Faith. We talked about the future of the Faith and our
part in it and of the opportunities that lay ahead. He told me, as he had
written me, that he wanted to go to Haifa to serve the Faith. He never
discussed his career in more detail — only that he hoped to be of service to the
Cause in whatever way the Master would say. <span data-pg-empty=""> It was always, “What the
Master would say.” Of course, translation alone would not have been enough for
him. He never gave <u>any</u> indication that he expected to become the Guardian. 

He was intensely interested in the outstanding speakers at Oxford and
especially those in Oxford Union, where their great statesmen had received
their training. He wanted me to attend the debates with him and to hear the
address by Bryce. <span data-pg-empty=""> He hoped we could discuss the talks together. After my
visit I received a card from him dated 6 November 1920, which bore the crest of
the Oxford Union Society: 
Dear ‘Alí: 
I have received your card, and I knew well that it would
       be difficult for you to come here again. I did miss you
       profoundly last night and the night before, particularly as
       I firmly anticipated that we would both enjoy and comment
       upon the procedures of the debate and lecture. I trust,
       however, that you will not be detained a long time and that
       you will have not any difficulties to surmount. I have
       written to Grandmother about you reminding her of your
       difficult and strained situation yet your patience and will.
        I hope that some help might issue by the time you prepare
       yourself for entrance into college. My best and tenderest
       wishes be with you always. May we meet again under better
       circumstances.[^]

A few days later, shortly before I sailed, I received this further
evidence of Shoghi Effendi’s tender heart, loving kindness, and generosity,
at a time when his own problems were almost overwhelming: 
Oxford
10.11.20

Dear ‘Alí: 
I really never realized how minute, intense, and urgent
       were your financial needs. I hasten, therefore, to send
       you all that I can for the present — namely, five English
       pounds banknote, which I enclose with this letter. I hope
       you are staying at Miss Herrick’s. She has some rooms to
       offer to friends who come to London. If you are not there,
       do apply. She is so kind. 
My studies and preoccupations are exerting an effect
       upon me almost as distressing as your
       own difficulties. <span data-pg-empty=""> Believe me it is so. I don’t know what
       I shall do at the end. 
Yours lovingly
 Shoghi 
For Heaven’s sake think not of sending me back anything. I
       flatly refuse and decline. Let your mind be at rest.[^]

### SHOGHI EFFENDI
                      THE GUARDIAN OF THE CAUSE OF GOD 

It was two years later, when I was in Berkeley, California, that I heard
the news of the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It is strange, but we never
thought that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would die. Though He Himself alluded to His
passing, our minds had not, could not, accept the possibility. Before the will
of the Master was opened, I wrote to my father expressing my grief, my
affection, and my concern for Shoghi Effendi. It was the beloved young
Guardian himself who answered my letter. 

You have read in the history books how the unexpected news of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing almost broke Shoghi Effendi’s spirit. Coming
suddenly, without any warning, it was too much for him. He actually had to
leave Haifa and put the affairs of the Faith in the hands of the Greatest Holy
Leaf.[^] He had to recover from the
shock and regain his strength. 

[^ ] The Greatest Holy Leaf was Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, the daughter of
     Bahá’u’lláh and the sister of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. <span data-pg-empty=""> She was in charge of the
     Bahá’í Faith until Shoghi Effendi recovered from the shock of
     ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing and his own appointment as Guardian of the Cause
     of God. — Ed. 

His answer to my letter to my father, which he wrote on 23 January 1922,
gives you some idea of how he felt at the time: 
My dearest brother: 
The touching letter you had written to your dear father
       has been such a relief and comfort to me and to those who
       have perused it. <span data-pg-empty=""> In the midst of our sorrows, one ray of
       hope gives us the solace and peace that the world cannot
       give — namely, His sure and repeated promise that He will
       send souls that shall gloriously promote His Cause after
       Him. My dear brother! The pure faith, the ardor and the
       services of your father, I am sure, as well as your own
       noble wish, will make of you an efficient and
       energetic servant in His Cause, and I assure you of my
       prayers at His hallowed Shrine, that whatever you do,
       whatever you acquire may in the near future be wholly and
       directly put to the service of His Cause. 
I am too overwhelmed to write more fully, but I assure
       you of my prayers for you, my attachment to you, and my
       fervent hope that we shall both cooperate to the very last,
       in our servitude at His Holy Threshold. 
The bereaved Holy Leaves remember you with tenderness
       and hope and wish you a bright future wherever you may be.[^] 

[^ ] The Holy Leaves were the female members of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s family. — Ed. 
Yours in His Love and Service
 Shoghi 

An envelope was enclosed on which he had written: “Rose petals that have been
laid upon His Sacred Threshold.”[^] 

[^ ] Shoghi [Effendi] to [‘Alí M. Yazdí], 23 January 1922, Yazdí Papers. We
     have used house style for capitalization, spelling, and the
     transliteration of Persian and Arabic words. 

I did not see Shoghi Effendi again until 1928, when
my wife and I went to visit him. <span data-pg-empty=""> He had been the Guardian for seven years.
Our friendship continued throughout the years of the Guardianship. Shoghi
Effendi encouraged me to write him. But I was reluctant to do this, for he
always responded warmly, and I felt I must spare him. I did write under
special circumstances, or with good news, and have his exceptional letters of
those later times. But that is part of another story. 

As to his Guardianship, you all know about Shoghi Effendi’s splendid
achievements. How did his contributions affect the Bahá’ís at the time? Out
of the whole world this one man undertook tremendous tasks in every phase of
the Faith. There were translations of important books that he did almost
single-handedly. Before his translations we had very few good ones. His first
translation was “The Hidden Words”. Mrs. Corinne True in 1922 brought back from
Haifa a copy of the manuscript. A college girl, a guest of Mrs. True’s, spent
thrilling hours copying by hand the new translation to take home to California.
This young woman was later to become my wife.[^] 

[^ ] Marion Carpenter [Yazdí], on summer vacation from the University of
     California, Berkeley, with her brother, Howard, was an overnight guest office
     Mrs. True. That night she copied the entire manuscript of “The Hidden
     Words” by hand. “The Hidden Words of Bahá’u’lláh” (London: Bahá’í
     Assembly) was first published in 1923. — Ed. 

I can recall the day in Berkeley when we heard that Nabíl’s “The
“Dawn-Breakers” had been translated
by Shoghi Effendi.[^] We could hardly wait to receive a copy of this
enormous <span data-pg-empty=""> book. We immediately established a class to study it. The beautiful English
translation gives the flavor of the Persian original. Through reading “The
Dawn-Breakers”, the believers in America could, for the first time, get the
feeling of what the early Bábís had gone through and the experiences they
had had. 

[^ ] See Nabíl-i-A’ẓam [Muḥammad-i-Zarandí], “The Dawn-Breakers:
     “Nabíl’s Narrative of the Early Days of the Bahá’í Revelation”, trans.
     and ed. Shoghi Effendi (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1932). 

There was also “Bahá’í Administration”, the Guardian’s letters to the
American National Spiritual Assembly and to the American Bahá’í community,
form January 1922 to October 1932. Through such messages the Guardian built an
administrative institution block by block. Then there appeared “The World
Order of Bahá’u’lláh” in 1938, in which he established the Bahá’í
Administrative Order as “the nucleus and pattern of the world civilization”
emerging under Bahá’u’lláh. His own comprehensive history of the Faith, “God
Passes By”, appeared in 1944. Before it was published, an eager Berkeley
believer got the galley sheets from Wilmette and read all night.[^] 

[^ ] See Shoghi Effendi, “Bahá’í Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932
     7th rev. ed. (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1974); Shoghi
     Effendi, “The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh: Selected Letters”, 2d ed.
     (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1974); and Shoghi Effendi,
     “God Passes By”, new ed. (Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1974).
     Marion Holley [Hofman] was the “eager believer” who received the galleys
     of “God Passes By” from the Bahá’í Publishing Committee’s office in
      Wilmette. 

Among his other achievements the Guardian completed the outer shell of the
Shrine of the Báb. He extended and beautified the gardens on Mt. Carmel and
at Bahjí. He carried on a vast correspondence with believers all over the
world — in Persian, in English, and in French. He had no staff for carrying out
major projects. Nobody went to Haifa to work with him when he needed help so
greatly — perhaps because they thought that he was indestructible. Actually,
they did not really realize how much he needed
assistance. <span data-pg-empty=""> In the early days of the Faith in America and elsewhere,
everything was happy-go-lucky and informal. Each one did what he liked. When
the Guardian came, he established the administrative order. It was not easy.
Some people did not like the idea; they were not used to it. Until the friends
could function properly, he could not use them. When that time came, he
appointed the Hands of the Cause of God. It was through that institution and
through the International Bahá’í Council (the precursor of the Universal
House of Justice) that he was able to get the help he so desperately needed.[^] 

[^ ] The Hands of the Cause of God were stewards of the Faith appointed by
     Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi to assist in the
     Faith’s unity and development. At the time of Shoghi Effendi’s passing
     there were twenty-seven Hands of the Cause alive. These individuals
     guided and directed the affairs of the Cause until the Universal House of
     Justice was elected in 1963. The International Bahá’í Council was
     established in 1951 under the direction of Shoghi Effendi. The
     International Council was, in the words of Shoghi Effendi, “the most
     significant milestone in evolution of Administrative Order of the Faith
     of Bahá’u’lláh in course of last thirty years” (“Messages to the
     Bahá’í World: 1950-1957”, rev. ed. [Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing
     Trust, 1971],7). 

Of course, his marriage
to Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum was a great blessing; <span data-pg-empty="">that was really the greatest
thing that happened to him during his Guardianship.[^] She meant so much to
him and helped him tremendously. 

[^ ] Nee Mary Maxwell, from Montreal, Canada. Shoghi Effendi appointed her a
     Hand of the Cause of God in 1952. — Ed. 

But despite the lack of help until later in his life, Shoghi Effendi
completed vast teaching plans and innumerable projects. <span data-pg-empty=""> It was incredible how
much work he could turn out through his determination to serve the Cause. He actually
broke his health, and that is one reason for his untimely death. 

Shoghi Effendi left us a majestic legacy. When I think of that brilliant,
devoted, and purposeful Guardian and his unbelievable accomplishments, I am
awed by the bounties bestowed upon us. 

Nevertheless, my mind keeps going back to the lively, handsome, happy,
young man I knew in my youth, who looked ahead eagerly to the future. He could
not have known, in those days, how unique, how momentous would be his destined
role in the triumph of our beloved Cause.

# Notes taken while In Haifa and Acca during my visit with our beloved Master

### 1900 

------

It is my great and blessed privilege to visit our Beloved Master in company with Mr., Mrs. Dodge and Mr., Mrs. Getsinger in the year 1900, and from September 25th, till October the 19th, we were permitted to meet with Him daily.  

We arrived in Haiji September the twenty-fourth, and were met by many beautiful believers, and escorted to our Hotel at three o’clock in the morning, Mr. Haddad’s face was the first to loan up in the darkness – and our happiness at seeing him was akin to that of being home.  

Word was sent to our dear Master that we had arrived and soon after a Messenger came bearing fruit and messages of love from Him, telling of His happiness at our safe arrival, and later in the day come the word that He was ready to receive us. He had been moving His tent to be nearer to us, thus preventing Him from sending us earlier.  

I shall not attempt to describe that visit, nor my first impression of Him, I could not put it into words what I felt. Nor can words describe Our Beloved Master. Nor does one fully realize His Greatness, His love and gentleness, humility and grandeur, till they have passed beyond that Presence for the last time, and then it comes gradually, and the farther one recedes, the greater He appears. Our Master was spending some time in Haija and the Greatest Holy Leaf, and two daughters of our Lord were keeping house for Him, so we were invited to take breakfast, with Him nearly every morning. We would arise at five o’clock and after a twenty minute walk we come to the little house at the foot of Mt. Carmel, almost in u straight line from the Tomb of the Báb. There we would sit for an hour with our Beloved Master, and in company with dear Abaul Fazal – would have such beautiful lessons.  

Our Master told us one morning that there is such magnetism between souls of the same belief that when the heart is pure, we are instantly drawn toward one another, and that the progression of the Truth, depends upon our attitude toward one another. That we must put away all feeling of envy or malice and love each other with our whole hearts, for that is doing God’s Will.   

He told us from the time of Moses, all the Messengers of God and prophets, announced the coming of “God”, Enoch the seventh from Adam used to preach the coming of “God” and with thousand of “His Sainte” Jude prophesied that “God” could appear on the earth for judgement. Also Job 19th Chap. 25-26 verse. “I know that my Redeemer liveth, and “that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, and in my flesh shall I see God”. The soul and spirit is an abstract essence, which is separable from the material body, as to its individuality and identity, but in reality is inseparable. There are many definitions for the soul; but the ones has been agreed upon by the learned people.

## The Feast of Naurcoz

### Munír Zayn

### 1909

Sunday morning, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá drove from ‘Akká to Haifa with His family and a few of the old believers. Along the shore, halfway between the two cities, there is now a small house which the government has built for the watch of the road. Here, in the middle of the dessert, He stopped and had luncheon; then, after an hour and a half, we reached Haifa.  

But few believers knew that nine years ago the remains of His Holiness, the Báb, had been quietly placed in the (piece of) Hasserrat-o-Ikeeda on Mount Carmel.  

A week before the Feast of Naurcoz ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had sent to Haifa two of the believers that they should prepare everything for the coming ceremonies.  

Nine years ago a believer from Rangoon (India) sent to Haifa a large casket made of marble, beautifully worked with the Greatest Name relief and gilded three times on each side. It was to later hold the remains of the Báb which had been kept sixty years (59 A.D. or solar year) in safety. Now they were to be definitely buries by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.  

A few weeks before some twenty men had pulled this heavy marble casket up the mountain.  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave the last necessary instructions and it was slowly slid down into the under part of the Tomb. This must have been performed with the Holy of the Hosts of the Kingdom of El Abhá, for though the work presented great difficulty and was done by inexperienced men, everyone wondered at the ease with which it was all done.  

The shrine under the ground was lighted with but one lamp. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá waited until all was well finished.  

He threw off His turban and hat.
 
He removed His shoca.
 
but what fooled was no impressive that it is useless for me to attempt to picture it. I will simply relate what happened. Our beloved Lord with His hair waving around His beautiful head, His face shining with light, looking inspired, fragile and majestic, rushed down and threw Himself on His knees. He placed the remains of the Báb in the large coffin (placed in the marble casket) and leaning His blessed head on the border of the coffin, He wept, wept, wept and all wept with Him!  

That night the Master did not sleep.

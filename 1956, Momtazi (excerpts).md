### 1956, Momtazi (excerpts)  

------


Our car is taking the TEL-AVIV Haifa road. We are near to our Beloved Guardian now. The time of attainment in near: our hearts; me and my wife’s: is beating fast, all we are thinking of now is how we must present ourselves before OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN.

We have come a long way but the DOME of the SHRINE is not visible yet. We cannot wait any longer and everyone is anxious to meet OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN.

Alas: here is the DOME; we can see it clearly now. Our hearts are beating faster; this sign speaks to us: it tells us that the time of attainment is near and that we do not have to wait much longer.

We are now in Haifa but we do not know where to go in this strange place and yet in this Holy city: to the pilgrim’s house or to the sacred Residence of our BELOVED GUARDIAN. One of us suggested that we ring to his residence and ask for his advice but while this state of confusion was prevailing FUGITA called a taxi and told him to drive toward our BELOVED GUARDIAN’S Residence.

We got into the taxi and with an extraordinary speed the driver took us to his sacred residence.

When entering our Beloved Guardian’s residence we saw the familiar “ABD-UL-BAHÁ… ‘ABBÁS...” all of which were reminding me of my previous visit to this Holy place in 1920 - 35 years ago.

We kissed these sacred words while we were Hell over Head in confusion. The sacred door was opened and FUGITA who was walking ahead of us was the first to enter it. From a far distance we could see our sacred second MARY AMAT-UL ROUHIYIH-<u>KH</u>ÁNUM

We are now in complete ignorance and no one knows when we are destined to meet our Beloved Guardian: who as we learned later was already informed that PILGRIMS from too Far-East the farthest place to the HOLY-LAND: have come to Him and with humble hearts are waiting to MEET HIM.

His ocean of mercy was touched and we were immediately called in HIS presence.

### THE VISIT

The time had come when the voice of son would speak to us. Finally our sufferings came to an end and HIS DOOR WAS opened UNTO US. FUGITA and I had lost our minds and all we knew was thus we were on his HOLY FEET; He tried to lift us up but Alas; our hands were tightly bound to his HOLY FEET. FUGITA and I had each of as; one of his HOLY FEET in our Hands. FUGITA was told to leave his HOLY feet and to stand up: but since he was told so in English. I took it as being addressed only to him and not to me:  and I was told to stand on FUGITA took advantage of the situation: and thus each of us was holding one of his HOLY FEET in his ARMS.  

Here was my reward after 35 years of depression and sufferings: I was depressed since I had been so far from our Beloved GUARDIAN; and yet I had suffered greatly as I was unable to attend and serve HIM from close.  

This was our situation for a few minutes until FUGITA and I were somehow unconsciously and with the help of our BELOVEB GUARDIAN lifted up and stood humbly at his presence.  

We were all wet with tears at this moment and only those who had the happiness and privilege to visit him know what these tears meant to us.  

It was at this moment that my wife arrived too and ignorant of our presence threw herself on his HOLY FEET; and since she was alone she had HIS two feet in her Arms. She was kissing his feet and her voice; which was coming deep from her heart; was repeatedly heard: saying “MY SOUL BE SACRIFICED TO THOU” ; until one too was unconsciously lifted up with HIS help and stood humbly at his presence; it was then and there that one observed us in his presence.  

Our BELOVED GUARDIAN asked us to seat: and then his HOLY VOICE APOKE TO US:  

“You had come a long way leaving seas and skies behind yourselves to come to me, you are welcome; I was waiting for you. Then he asked us if we had any delay in our way to the HOLY-LAND: stressing that we had come a little late.”  

Thanks to God that you have pioneered to Japan: said our BELOVED GUARDIAN. The faith of GOD has made great progress in Japan and with your efforts; devotions and determination BAHÁ’Í centres have been set up all over JAPAN for the activities of our friends in this country.  

I had always looked with appreciation to your services; all of which will be recorded in the history. Now we are at the beginning of the administration ORDER of JAPAN; in future you will face big victories and successes in this country. I am happy and delighted at your faithful services in JAPAN: do not weep now it is the moment of your happiness. Thanks GOD that you have made a great progress in JAPAN: this progress is both in spirit and in organizing the administration ORDER in that country.   

Then our BELOVED GUARDIAN asked me: How are our friends in JAPAN:   

All of them are continuing their sincere services to THOU with faith and diligence; I replied: and all they ask for is YOUR help and blessings.  

Thanks God; said our BELOVED GUARDIAN; that our friends are all determined and sincere to the faith irrespectible of their nationality and no matter whether they are IRANIANS JAPANESE OR AMERICANS.  

Our Friends in HIROSHIMA are presenting to your HOLINESS their humble and sincere devotions. I said to our BELOVED GULRDIAN.  

(The people of HIROSHIMA said our Beloved Guardian have suffered greatly during the recent war and they are therefore prepared to accept the faith simply. This is a new centre which was set up and opened to the faith of GOD after Mr. KHADES visit to the FAR EAST.  

You have had the great privilege of visiting the HOLY-LAND; said our BELOVED GUARDIAN; while this visit was very difficult during the time of BAHÁ-U-LIAH. Our friends bud to travel for six months in those time in Order to come to the HOLY-LAND: while they could our here only for a few minutes and his HOLINESS BAHÁ-U-LLAH could only have a look on them. They could never stay in his presence more than a few moments. Now the situation is changed but you must value thee, precious occasion.   

Turning toward JAPAN again He said: you must treat the Japanese with kindness: since as our BELOVED BAHÁ-U-LLAH says, “A KING WORD CAPTURES A HEART “. After speaking these HOLY words our Beloved Guardian up and left us.   

After his departure we got up too and started walking the KARMEL Mountain.  

On the way to the mountain we were praising GOD: while we were all astonished: Now we his humble servant are called here in this HOLY—PLACE.  

It is obvious that as everyone else we were all desire to come to the presence of HIS APOSTLE but the amazing thing now was that THE APOSTLE at the moment was waiting for us and he wished to see us.  

“It is for ease occasions that the IRANIAN POET said:  

“There in nothing unusual when a HUNTER fallows a DEER: “  

“But it is quite different; when our Fear deer comes to meet its HUNTER”  

“It in only the work of GOB and the wishes of our MASTER that such miracles happen”  

After all these spiritual inspirations which HIS presence had inspired in us we departed toward the BÁB—SHRINE through a guide; MISS REVEL. We walked through beautiful gardens and nicely decorated avenues until we arrived near the SHRINE.  

### OUR PILGRIMAGE TO THE SHRINE 

It was a sweet dream for us. We were in doubt whether it was our own persons here before the HOLY-SHRINE:  

Now beautiful are these flowers; and what an enchanting views we are facing now. The whole earth is now attractive and beautiful for us: with a sort at beauty and fascination that we not seen or touched before.  

A spiritual breeze is blowing on us. Here is the promised paradise of human beings: appeared onto us in the face of those enchanting Gardens.  

Thin garden with its beautiful flowers in it is the sacred residence of our Beloved Guardian and a single flower or everything which it has in it is a symbol of him and brings HIM into our memories. But above all those in the GOLDEN DOME OF THE SHRINE OF BÁB which according to our Beloved Guardian is “The White Dress of mankind’s Bride decorated with a Golden Grown. “  

We are now before the SHRINE and the doors were opened UNTO US, Suddenly all the lamps are lighted and the whole sacred Place turned into 3 piece of Bright-jewel.  

We all fell into worship and prayed for the prosperity of mankind; our Japanese friends and for our close relations. A spiritual enchanting breeze is blowing on us while our heads are bowed on the THRESHOLD of HIS HOLY PLACE. We feel as if the spirit of all GOD’S prophets are now pilgriming in this HOLY PLACE.  

In our hearts addressing his HOLINESS BÁB we were repeating the words:  

“OH DEAR BÁB OUR SOULS BE SACRIFICED TOT THY SACRED BLOOD and THEY OPPRESSED BODY: THOU WERE PRISONED IN TCHERIGH and MAKU while thou HAD NONE BESIDES YOU THERE WAS not even a servant to light A LAMP FOR THOU and finally THOU WERE MARTYRED IN AZARBAIJAN BUT SINCE THOU GAVE TO THE WORLD and PROMISED YOUR ETERNAL & FUTURE KINGDOM TO MANKIND; THOUSANDS LAMPS ARE NOW LIGHTED IN YOUR HOLY PLACE LIGHTING OUR HEARTS”  

Although our Beloved Guardian is not with us in this PILGRIMAGE but his first visit had such a spiritual effect on us which is if he is always with us and we now feel his presence.  

### THE PROGRESS OF THE CAUSE OF GOD IN JAPAN

In the afternoon of 27th Dec. 1955, our Beloved Guardian came toward the Gardens of the Pilgrim House and called us unto his presence. We now had the privilege to walk with HIM. He was a shining STAR before the dark sky of our lives. The light of his appearance had given a special dignity to these gardens and it was at this time that our Beloved Guardians mind and spirit turned toward JAPAN and said,   

“The faith of God will make a great progress in JAPAN as our Beloved BAHÁ-U-LLAH has promised us: he says If you cover the light in the middle of the EARTH it will come out from the middle of the OCEANS and SEAS and it will speak unto you saying: BEHOLD’ I am the light and the saviour of the world.”  

Our Beloved Guardian then explained what this meant: by the Middle of the Earth; he said Our Beloved BAHÁ-U-LLAH meant ÍRÁN which is in the middle of ASIA and by: the middle of OCEANS and SEAS he meant JAPAN which is an Island among the ocean and seas.  

He then added that if they would try to hide the faith of GOD in PERSIA it will appear and come out from Japan saying, “That I am the true light and the savior of mankind. Still; said our Beloved Guardian; they have not been successful in eliminating the faith of GOD in ÍRÁN and the same situation will continue for a time.”  

HIROSHIMA: I then spoke to our beloved Guardian of our NEW center in HIROSHIMA which is set up by the local Japanese inhabitants of this city.  

Of course; said our Beloved Guardian such Centres must be set up though the efforts and determination of the Japanese people: as in the case of AFRICA where our friends are so active and enthusiastic in their works that they extended their activities and pioneered to other countries. Japan; he then told us; will become a second AFRICA one day. Our faith was introduced in this country fifty years ago but now it is the moment of obtaining positive results from our activities.  

ADMINISTRATION ORDER: The National Spiritual Assemblies in AFRICA this year. One in the heart of AFRICA; second in the WEST and the third one is SOUTH.  

Turning to the question in Japan: our beloved Guardian said: the surrounding Islands will be ordered to send delegates to Japan to participate in selecting the members of the National Spiritual Assembly (N.S.A.) of Japan which is to take place next year.  

Then this National Spiritual Assembly can be called the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan and the FAR EAST Island, I said.  

But our Beloved Guardian corrected my statement by saying “not all the islands” as there are too many of them in the Far East: but only the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan and the surrounding islands.  

### NEW BELIEVER IN KOBE JAPAN

I then informed our Beloved Guardian that in Kobe a prominent educated personality; newspaperman in career has been recently converted into our faith: and has registered his name just before our departure to the HOLY LAND.  

This is very important said our Beloved Guardian after blessing the New Believer; (Mr. SAKO).  

Editors, authors and educated people are important provided that when converted to our faith they leave aside all their political activities and never interfere with such affairs again. Politicians and political affairs: said Our Beloved Guardian must never be an attraction to our friends but on the contrary their activities and work must be of such nature as to convince these politicians of GODS great work, the Importance of their Motto and the nothingness of their worldly ambitions and activities before HIS wishes.  

### THE NATIONAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY OF JAPAN AND NEW ZEALAND

The National Spiritual Assembly of JAPAN; said our Beloved Guardian is the foundation of the NORTH PACIFIC for our Administration Order and the National Spiritual Assembly of the NEW ZEALAND and the foundation of the South Pacific for this Administration order. And between these two; he then added; we will have two National Spiritual Assemblies: One in PUGI in EAST of Australia and the Second in Indonesia: EAST of Asia.  

Therefore we will have four National Spiritual Assemblies as followed:  

1.	One Spiritual Assembly for Japan and the surrounding Islands: to be set up in Japan.  

2.	One SpiritualAssembly in SOUTH: to be set up in NEW ZEALAND.  

3.	The third National Spiritual Assembly will be set up in the East of Australia at the FUGI Island.  

4.	Another N. S. A. or the Fourth one is to be set up in INDONESIA.  

5.	And finally the fifth N. S. A. in Australia.  

Then he turned to the Iranian pilgrims and said:  

These five National Spiritual Assemblies will form the foundations of our ORGANIZATION in PACIFIC OCEAN.  

A HAZIRAT-UL-GUDS is now set up in Tokyo through Mr. Momtazi’s efforts and devotions and the Local Spiritual Assembly of this city is already REGISTERED.  

The HAZIRAT-UL-GUDS has been purchased and the Local Spiritual Assembly is registered in Tokyo: both of these works: again confirmed OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN have been carried out are completed now.  

And all these had come to us through the efforts and devotions of Mr. Momtazi who is the DISTINGUISHED servant of the FAITH OF GOD.  

These all: I replied had been accomplished through THOU blessings and guidance; and through the Spiritual Inspirations that THOU has extended to your humble servant.  

You have come a long way; almost half of the GLOBE said Our Beloved Guardian and he then Blessed me.  

### BAHÁ’Í NEWS FOR JAPAN

Are you receiving the Bahá’í News in Japan regularly and in time: asked our Beloved Guardian;  

Yes; Our Beloved Guardian I replied.  

Through which channels he again asked?  

Through U. S. A. regularly and sometimes from ÍRÁN: I replied  

Our Beloved Guardian then gave Instructions so that we may translate the Main parts of our News and circulate them.  

We have a BULLETIN, I said; which is called the Bahá’í News and this is printed in Japanese Language in Tokyo.  

Although this is published in Japanese language; said our Beloved Guardian you should send a copy of it regularly tot the HOLY LAND.  

Praise be to THY knowledge and wisdom; I said to myself: THOU surely knowest Japanese too.  

### TRANSLATION OF THE BAHÁ’Í LITERATURE IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE

Our Beloved Guardian: then pointed out that the BAHÁ’Í literature has been translated into most languages while up to now very little of it has been translated into Japanese Language.  

The translated of this literature: I replied is very difficult but still our translators are working on it with keen interest.  

You must be very careful; said OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN so that these translations are accurate and correct; these translations must be very accurate and precise expressing all the expressions and the beauties of our literature. They must be translated i n such a way as to leave the real meaning the spirit of the original text untouched.  

He then asked us to send a copy of everything we translate there, to the HOLY LAND. I will keep these works; said OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN; since I have books from 180 languages in the international ATRCHIVE of the HOLY LAND.  

### THE NEW ORDER OF JAPAN

Now the Bahá’í’s of JAPAN said; our BELOVED GUARDIAN must think of selecting their National Spiritual Assembly. Hither to they were selection of the Local Spiritual Assembly. Now they must make preparations for their National Spiritual Assembly.  

We have two Local Spiritual Assemblies in Japan said OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN. One in Tokyo and the other in … he waited a few moments to name the second place; while I said the local Spiritual Assembly of Hiogoken. I then explained to our BELOVED GUARDIAN that in Japan the collection of several cities in one place is called KEN: I wanted to give further explanation to our BELOVED GUARDIAN about the type of organization in Japan starting with KEN I was going to explain the rest; but before being able to continue our Beloved Guardian said; and after KEN comes FU and after FU.. TO and TOKYO is TO; Is not so? I bowed and it was at this moment that I realized that Our Beloved Guardian knows everything.  

### SPECIAL ATTENTION TO JAPAN AND ITS REASON

I said to our Beloved Guardian:  

Previously and when our Beloved Guardian and informed us that on 1957 the JAPANESE National Spiritual Assembly will take place: we were all amazed and were wondering has this is to happen. We had no Local Spiritual Assemblies in Japan; the believers of the Cause of God were so few and many requirements were to be met. But now that through GODS Grace and Our Beloved Guardians Blessings and assistance this is going to take place we are all certain that this has become a possibility from a DREAM through the blessings of our Beloved Guardian. It is obvious that the cause of God has worked its way in this matter.  

Our Beloved Guardian then turned his face toward me and said: Do you know why and how all these had come into reality? It is because of the obedience to the Administration Order that all this have been performed; he then replied to his own question.  

By the Administration Order our Beloved Guardian meant that one must be faithful to his covenant as it is the wish and desire of our Master ABD-UL-BAHÁ.  

### THE UNITY OF THE BAHÁ’ÍS OF JAPAN

Are all the BAHÁ’Í’S of JAPAN UNITED and FAITHFUL to the cause of GOD; our Beloved Guardian asked me then.  

Although they are different Nationalities and Races; such as Iranians, Americans, Japanese and the Unity of these divert types and races is difficult thanks GOD all of them are united and faithful in our GREAT MOTTO and the Cause of GOD.  

Our Beloved Guardian was delighted at hearing this and we could see happiness and delight in his face and in his whole appearance.  

### THE JAPANESE YOUTH AND WOMEN

The Japanese youth and women must be encouraged to be brave in serving the Cause of GOD: said our Beloved Guardian while he was turning his face to me.  

Have you many young people in TOKYO?  

Our Beloved Guardian was told that we have not many young people in TOKYO.  

Special and private committees must be organized for young people and woman: added then our Beloved Guardian. The privilege of our faith he said, is that women will progress and improve far above men in the EAST.  

How are the BAHÁ’Í women of JAPAN; he then asked me?  

All of them are active and faithful to the cause of GOD: I replied: especially the young girls of Japan who are newly converted. They take an active part in our organizations and have become members of the Local Spiritual Assembly.  

You must encourage them very much; said then our Beloved Guardian.  

I pointed out then that the Japanese women are mostly educated.  

I know it: said our Beloved Guardian.  

They are very polite, hardworking and patient when being oppressed: I then added.  

Still they are oriental; said our Beloved Guardian and more or less under the influence of man but you must encourage them; make them brave; and change their conditions.  

Again our Beloved Guardian added: that the young people and BAHÁ’Í women must be very CLEAN and Virtuous: especially in Írán.  

Our Beloved Guardian then pointed out that the moral of society is Low in U. S. A., Is it the same in Japan?  

“Yes” I replied; it is the same in Japan.  

People have realized themselves from fanaticism in twentieth century but on the other hand they have turned to material and have become materialistic. They escaped one disaster but are now involved in another one.  

NECESSITY OF OBEDIENCE OF JAPANESE BELIEVERS FROM UNITED STATES N. S. A.  

The Japanese organizations are under the supervision of U. S. A. Organizations and I have entrusted JAPAN to U. S. A. as I have entrusted TURKEY to ÍRÁN. The National Spiritual Assembly of JAPAN must be organized by U. S. A.’s organizations: confirmed our Beloved Guardian.  

Then our Beloved Guardian asked if the BAHÁ’Í’S of JAPAN are obeying the BAHÁ’Í’s of U. S. A.?  

“Yes” I replied: our Beloved Guardian;  

Our Beloved Guardian then confirmed again; that the U. S. A. Organizations are supervising and taking care of the JAPANESE Organizations and that this is the NEW WORLD’s ORDER.  

The L. S. A. of Tokyo must be an intermediate between the U. S. A National Spiritual Assembly and the BAHÁ’Í’s of JAPAN. It must take the required information from the U. S. A. and give it to the BAHÁ’Í’s of JAPAN. As now it is the beginning of JAPAN’s organization: said our Beloved Guardian; all the measures and the steps which we take with regard to forming these Organizations must be progress of the Cause of GOD: said our Beloved Guardian depends on having plans and means: plans he then added are very important in performing this Great work.  

### THE IMPORTANCE OF YOKOHAMA AND KIYOTO

Yokohama and Kiyoto said our Beloved Guardian are two important cities in JAPAN and you must pay them a special attention.  

### THE PROGRESS OF THE CAUSE OF GOD IN JAPAN

Thanks to God said our Beloved Guardian; that the cause of GOD has made a great progress in JAPAN. Then he turned to the IRANIAN PILGRIMS and added: Mr. MOMTAZI is the distinguished SERVANT OF THE CAUSE OF GOD; and turning to me he said: You must assure that the Japanese people that their country will turn into a second AFRICA one day: the fire started from U. S. A. but its flames are now appearing in JAPAN. Like ÍRÁN, many BAHÁ’Í centres will be formed in JAPAN: It will have an N. S. A. and the National Spiritual Assembly of JAPAN is formed the faith of GOD will make a great progress there. There will be a convention for selecting the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of JAPAN.  

Are the members of the Convention to be selected by the Local Spiritual Assemblies or by the BAHÁ believers of JAPAN I asked?  

The members of National Spiritual Assembly: said our Beloved Guardian will be selected by the members of the convention; and the members of the convention will have already formed and established their Local Spiritual Assemblies.  

Are the members of the convention to be elected by the Centres which have Local Spiritual Assemblies or the other centres with no Local Spiritual Assemblies can also participate in selecting these members: I asked?  

Only the centres which have formed their Local Spiritual Assemblies must take part in selecting the members of the convention: replied our Beloved Guardian. This decision has been taken for the purpose of encouraging all our centres to set up their Local Spiritual Assemblies as soon as possible.  

How many Local Spiritual Assemblies we must have in JAPAN to set up a National Spiritual Assembly: I asked?  

The more Local Spiritual Assemblies you have in JAPAN; the better replied the BELOVED GUARDIAN.  

### THE REGISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY OF JAPAN WITH THE GOVERNMENT’S CONCERNED AUTHORITIES

First of all said our Beloved Guardian: we must set up the National Spiritual Assembly of JAPAN and then comes a question of registering it in JAPAN and finally comes the question of registering the same in the HOLY LAND.  

The Government of JAPAN has already register our Assembly: I replied at this moment.  

This is the Local Spiritual Assembly which is registered: said  our Beloved Guardian when the National Spiritual Assembly of JAPAN is set up you must try to register it too.  

This will become a problem for us: I replied as the government of Japan according to their Laws and regulations must have one person responsible for this assembly and not a Committee.  

Our Beloved Guardian replied: that the Assembly must be registered in the name of a Committee and not a person. He then added; that first of all we must investigate about this matter: secondly we must consult and ask the advise of specialists and finally to work hard for the solution of this problem – and when you do all these; He said you will certainly succeed.  

### ENDOWMENTS OF JAPAN

Thanks God; said our Beloved Guardian that we have now two HAZIRAT-UL-GUDS and our endowments too must be included to them.  

With the blessings of GOD; I replied; the required land for JAPAN’s Endowments is already prepared.  

I know it; said our Beloved Guardian; thanks GOD that the privilege of contributing this land for this purpose has been yours too. These are important matters; said our Beloved Guardian; they will be recorded in HISTORY, both the contributed land and the name of the contributors.  

### THE DUTIES OF THE 1957 L. S. A’s

It is the order; I said that only the Local Spiritual Assembly which were set up in 1956 are entitled to select delegates for the National Spiritual Assemblies: in this case what the duties of the Local Spiritual Assemblies of 1957.  

These L. S. A.: replied our Beloved Guardian must wait for a year and then they will select the delegates of the National Spiritual Assembly of 1958. The same applies in U. S. A.: added our Beloved Guardian.  

We have very little for setting up the National Spiritual Assembly of 1957 and therefore we are in great need; for THEIR BLESSINGS AND ASSISTANCE.  

The time is short: said our Beloved Guardian: but the blessings and assistance of GOD will come in time.  

### THE SYMBOL OF THE JAPANESSE BAHÁ’Í’S LOVE IN THE MANSION OF BEHJI

We then presented a symbol of Japanese BAHÁ’Í’s love to our BELOVED GUARDIAN; an embroidered piece of cloth of PUGI maintain at the bottom of which the following words were embroidered.  

“THIS PIECE IS A SYMBOL OF OUR MOST EXALTED LOVE TO THOU; OH OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN”  

We then thought of the extraordinary work and the many occupations and important matters which our Beloved Guardian has and the correspondence which he must carry out with 242 countries; and were of the opinion that He will come to our present after a period of at least one or two months. But a wonderful thing happened on the day of tomorrow; when we re visiting the MANSION OF BEHJI.  

The servant of the Mansion told us the good news that our present was accepted and that our Beloved Guardian had ordered him to hung it in a visible place in his own private ROOM in the Mansion; together with a picture of NIKKO’s conference: which was to be hanged somewhere in his sitting place.  

All I was wishing now was ; that all our BAHÁ’Í friends of Japan could be here to see us present in the HOLY PLACE.  

I started crying and was going almost to faint when I heard the servant of the Mansion speaking to us: saying that “We have all received the special blessings of HIS HOLINESS and that despite all the occupations and the troubles which our Beloved Guardian has to bear to MANKIND; He has noticed us so early and has given us his special blessings.”  

### THE PROGRESS OF THE CAUSE OF GOD IN THE WORLD

In our second visit on 27th Dec. 1955 our Beloved Guardian spoke of the progress of the Cause of God all over the world saying:  

The faith of GOD has made a great progress in the world: 160 assemblies: some of which are National Spiritual Assemblies and others Local Spiritual Assemblies are registered ; and you will see their respective Documents in the BEHJI mansion.  

Our literature; then continued our Beloved Guardian; is translated into 190 languages; our Centres have reached the figure of 3700 throughout the world; of which the 1500 are in U. S. A.: Then comes ÍRÁN which has between 700 to 800 Centres. But our Friends in this country must try to bring the figure to 1000. Also we have more than 400 centres in Africa; 100 in Canada and another 100 in England.  

### OUR PIONEERS IN THE NORTHEST PARTS OF AMERICAN CONTINENT

Our pioneers; said our Beloved Guardian: have reached to the 73 latitude above the equator ZONE. This is the Northest BAHÁ’Í world: It is around the Northern POLE. The highest inhabited point above equator in 68: but our BAHÁ’Í friends have reached to 73.  

But in Europe they have reached the 70 latitude above the Equator ZONE. Then Our Beloved Guardian added; “HIS HOLINESS BAHÁ-U-LLAH in “KETABE-AGHDASS” has spoken to us about these Islands… in that book he has ordered us to pray the OBLIGATORY PRAYER in regular intervals in the places and cities where they have long nights and long days.”  

This saying is for such Islands: since in the middle of winter there is no SUN in them; and in the middle of summer the sun disappears from them.  

The number of the countries where the faith of GOD has reached them is now 242. In the ten years crusade it was originally planned that another 131 new countries should be open to the faith of GOD.  

You must communicate these GLAD TIDINGS to our BAHÁ’Í friends in JAPAN: then said our Beloved Guardian.  

Two countries which are newly opened in the faith of GOD and which were not mentioned in our plan –the ten year crusade: are TRINIDAD and SAIGON. Another country which was not originally named in the ten years crusade is TIBET which is a country beyond the IRON CURTAIN and the centre of BUDDHISM.  

### THE RACES WHICH HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO THE CAUSE OF GOD

The various race converted to the faith of GOD are above FOURTY now: the white race comes first and has the majority but later the NEGRO race will take over the Majority as the number of the believers of the BLACK race has exceeded the figure of 2300 within a period of less than 3 years.  

After the black comes the RED race or the natives of America: of whom only few have been converted up to now.  

### THE ISLANDS OPENED TO THE FAITH OF GOD

The converted Islands are over 95 of which 30 were converted before the ten years crusade. Another 65 Islands were converted to the Cause of GOD while 65 Islands were converted during the period of crusade.  

During 100 years only 30 Islands were converted to the Cause of GOD while 65 Islands are converted and opened to the faith of GOD during three years.  

Our delight was beyond description when we heard all these GLAD TIDINGS; and we all wanted to have all our BAHÁ’Í friends from all over the world to hear HIS words and to share our Delight and Happiness.  

There is so much Good News arriving from all over the world; said our Beloved Guardian; that I have not time either to write or to communicate it.  

I am therefore communicating these good news to our pilgrims who are visiting the HOLY LAND so that in their turn they may communicate the same to our BAHÁ’Í friends all over the world.  

### PURCHASED OF NATIONAL HAZIRAT-UL-GUDS’s ALL OVER THE WORLD

In the ten years crusade we had planned to purchase 50 national HAZIRAT-UL-GUDS : while up to this moment thanks to GOD 32 National Ḥaẓírat-UL-Guds are purchased and during less than 3 years; including the Ḥaẓírat-UL-Guds of Tokyo.  

### THE BAHÁ’Í NEW ORDER

Then our Beloved Guardian said: His Holiness BÁB in His HOLY BOOK has spoken to us about the BAHÁ’Í NEW ORDER.  

In his prison at MAKU at the time of distress and depression His Holiness said:  

“HAPPY BE THOSE WHO CAN SEE THE NEW ORDER OF BAHÁ-U-LLAH”  

His Holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH in his turn had spoken to us about the NEW ORDER and says:  

“The Order of the OLD WORLD HAS BEEN ABOLISHED AND REPLACED BY THIS NEW ORDER.”  

His Holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH has spoken of two orders: said our Beloved Guardian: the first is the OLD order which will be abolished and the second is the New Order which will replace this abolished order.  

In his “WILL & TESTAMENT” his Holiness ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ has spoken to us about how this New Order is to be performed.  

It is through organizing Local Spiritual Assemblies and National Spiritual Assemblies and the International Houses of Justice that the NEW ORDER will be put into work all over the world; said our Beloved Guardian.  

The foundation of the NEW ORDER which is the establishment of LOCAL SPIRITUAL Assemblies; are already performed on the other hand: the pillar of this construction namely the National Spiritual Assemblies are ready and therefore only the ROOF of construction: which is the International Houses of JUSTICE is left to be constructed.  

The members of the International-Houses of Justice; said our Beloved Guardian must be selected by the National Spiritual Assemblies. Now it is the beginning of this NEW-ORDER: he then added.  

His Holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH: has ruled this NEW ORDER and his Holiness ABD-UL-BAHÁ has explained to us how how this will be performed; in his WILL & TESTAMENT.  

Now it is the time to perform it This is the GREAT HAPPY TIDINGS.  

### PILGRIMAGE OF THE SHRINE Of BÁB AT THE PRESENCE OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN

While speaking with us our Beloved Guardian was proceeding toward the HOLY SHRINE OF BÁB and we were following him. At intervals he would worship the place and when entering the SHRINE he worshiped and kissed the THESSHOLD of the SHRINE. Following his we kissed the places which he had kissed and by this; as the Iranian PUET says: we were performing two performances by a single ACT: both of which had given us a great delight and happiness. I wish all our friends from all over the world could be here to her our Beloved Guardian’s Voice; while he was reading with HIS OWN SACRED VOICE the TABLET OF VISITATION.   

We fell into a sort of unconsciousness and we were almost going to faint when HIS heavenly MELLODY was heard. Our souls were flying in the skies and HIS HOLY VOICE had taken us into HEAVEN and in the DWELLING PLACE of the Angels.  

We are sure that whatever we had asked from our LORD-GOD then and there it will be GRANTED unto us: since we had all these blessings and were received with kindness; affection & mercy by our Beloved Guardian.  

### OUR BEELOVED GUARDAIN’s SPEACH AND HIS WALK WITH US

Up to now we had been always presented to our Beloved Guardian while he was walking in the garden. He was speaking to us; while making these walks and we knew in our hearts that all tune kings of the world were envying us as we were at the presence of our Spiritual King and had his blessings.   

### PURCHASED OF LAND FOR MASHREGH-UL-ASKAR IN THE HOLY LAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

Our Beloved Guardian said: that 100,000 Meters of land has been purchased at the TOP of the month KARMEL and a MASHREGH-UL-ASKAR will be build there soon. In the ten years crusade he added: we were supposed to purchase 11 pieces of Lands in 11 countries for this purpose while up to this time 10 pieces of these lands are purchased and only one is left.  

### HE KNOWS ALL THAT IS IN OUR HEARTS

One day when I was at our Beloved Guardians presence I thought of telling him about my visit to the HOLY LAND and our MASTER ABD-UL-BAHÁ which took place 35 years ago on 1920.  

You have been hero on 120 and have visited our MASTER 35 years ago; said our Beloved Guardian; before I could say a word to HIM and open my mind.   

### TWO PLANES FOR THE PROGRESS OF THE CAUSE OF GOD IN THE WORLD

We have two plans; said our Beloved Guardian to improve the faith of GOD in the world. One of these plans is our ten years crusade which is to be performed by National Spiritual Assemblies and Local Spiritual Assemblies and by our committees and BAHÁ’Í friends all over the world.   

This however is our Minor project and the second plan which is our Major plan is the of the unseen hand of our GOD: which at his order word out through the recent revolutions all over the world.   

While entering his CAR; the corner of our Beloved Guardian eyes would turn UNTO US and it was then and there and at o-serving snob affection by HIM that our souls and BODIES would not have the capacity to swallow all this affection and HIS WEDS. Then the door of his CAR would open and he would leave us: at those moments we would fall into a state of unconsciousness; a state which is spiritual and which can not to explained by words. This state was the effect of his HOLY WORDS and his Spiritual power on us. Here with our own eyes we were observing the Riding of the King of KINGS. He would lift up HIS hands and would look with affection to HIS devoted servants through the corner of his MS. We vented to have hundred lives at than, moments and sacrifice them all for his and before HIM.   

### THE BEGINNING OF THE RISE OF ISRAEL AND THE FALL OF ISLÁM

Since the Melons of Arabian countries have not realized the valuable and outstanding privileges of the faith of GOD; said our Beloved Guardian; GOD has blessed the I SRAELS victorious over that. The Arabs were 40,000,000 and the ISRAELS 700,000 but still as GOD was with the ISRAEL people they succeeded. All these lands added our Beloved Guardian has been purchased from the ISRAELS and these endowments are declared FREE from all sort of TAXES by the ISRAEL government.  

The ISRAEL governments Endowments are not free from taxes while our endowments are. It was the work of His Holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH that the ARABS were defeated.   

JAMAL PÁ<u>SH</u>Á opposing the faith of GOD was killed in PARIS: both the OSMAN Empire and the OSMAN religious Centre - Khalafat - were disappeared and destroyed from the world. SULTAN ‘ABDU’L-RAMID and SULTAN ‘ABDU’L-‘AZÍZ both of whom had opposed the CAUZE OF GOD were detrowned and prisoned.  

All the enemies and opponent; then added our Beloved Guardian with dignity and authority were defeated and destroyed.  

### THE REVOLT AND OPPOSITION OF THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD AGAINST THE BAHÁ’Í”S ALL OVER THE WORLD. 

The opposition against us; said our Beloved Guardian; has started from ÍRÁN. First it was only from SHIA sect but later the SONI’s too; joined in and started their opposition. Then came the turn of Protestants who started opposing us in U.S.A. Later the Anglican CHURCH joined this movement and began to oppose us. And finally came the turn of the Orthodox Church. The Catholics too will oppose and revolt against us one day. POP will start opposing us but at the end he will be DEPOSED.   

His holiness our Beloved ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ has spoken to us about those events; saying “Soon the voice of AMERICA & AFRICA will be heard”. This sentence means; added our Beloved Guardian: that the Christian missionaries of America and Africa will start to oppose us. Again our Beloved ABD-UL-BAHÁ says; that “the VOICE OF PARANG and TAJIK will be heard” and by FARANG; said our Beloved Guardian his Holiness meant the countries of EUROPE and by TAJIK he meant RUSSIA: who will oppose us when the time comes.  

Then the Voice of India and China will be heard: says His Holiness ‘ABDU’L-BABA. This means that the INDIANS whose religion is HINDU will oppose us. Then comes the turn of CHINA whose inhabitants are BUDDHISTS and finally the opposition will reach to JAPAN.   

Our Beloved Guardian then turned to me and ordered as to communicate these all to our BAHÁ’Í friends in JAPAN so that they might expect these oppositions and events.  

Then our Beloved Guardian spoke to us again: ‘‘Great opposition will, start against the Cause of God all over the world; but as his Holiness ABD-UL-BAHÁ has informed us in advance at the end at the wishes of GOD the Soldiers of Truth and the APOSTLES OF his Faith will appear all over the world and will defeat this revolt and opposition. In JAPAN; I replied; the BUDDHISTS are not fanatic and they are not opposing us.  

Because the Cause of GOD has not made a great progress there yet; replied our Beloved Guardian. But when the Cause of God will progress there they will start to oppose us. And when they start opposing us they will be defeated.  

Only if they do not oppose us they will be safe and will not face defeat.  

I am waiting for these historical events: added our beloved Guardian. There is no doubt about these events; they will all take place in due course and when the time comes.   

I asked then if the opposition was to begin soon.  

No; replied our Beloved Guardian; “it will take some time. It will certainly take place in due course. but the movement will be gradual. This movement has already started in ÍRÁN; where it had ended to the advantage and victory of the CAUSE OF GOD. The Iranian Governments policy is changed now; In the beginning it was a policy of attack now it is a policy of defense. This and our victory is due to the Unity of our BAHÁ’Í friends all over the world.   

### THE BEAUTIES OF KARMEL MOUNTAIN AND THE BUILDING, WHICH WILL BE CONSTRUCTED THERE

During the period of our stay in the HOLY LAND; one day our Belated Guardian turned toward to SHRINE OF BÁB and said   

“This is a beautiful dignified and outstanding SHRINE it is all light; there are step of light in this mountain; and in future it will be turned into a mountain of lights.”  

While speaking these words to us; his holiness Chair was placed in a high place and we were ordered to sit in his presence.   

Here was the MASTER OF THE WORLD Shining like the SUN and speaking to us; telling us of the past and the future of the WORLD. The future of the world; the events which will take place for the cause of GOD were spoken to us in such a dignified way and with such a Spiritual power and authority which was as if we could almost see and observe them with our own eyes.   

We will have two CENTRES in this mental; said our Beloved Guardian: One is the Spiritual Centre and the second our Centre for the Administration order.   

The Spiritual Centre is the SHRINE OF LAB but we will construct here the following buildings for maintaining & organizing the Administration ORDER.  

•	A building for the International Archive whose construction has already started.  

•	A Building for the International House of Justice where the unwritten Orders of our HOLY BOOK: KETABE-AGHDASS will be composed and ruled for the people of the world.  

•	A building for the guardians of the cause of GOD where they will explain the written but unknown orders of the HOLY BOOK - KETABA-AGHDAS.   

•	Also a building is to be allocated to Science-industry and Scientific researches.   

•	And finally there will be constructed a building for teaching the Cause of GOD. The hands of the Cause of GOD will meet in this Building.  

I asked; if the building for Teaching – The Cause of GOD is a spiritual Building or &irk Administrative CENTRE. It is an Administrative Building; replied our Beloved Guardian.   

Is the SHRINE OF BÁB our Spiritual centre only; I asked then.   

Only the SHRINE OF BÁB in the month of KARMEL and the SHRINE OF BAHÁ-U-LLAH in AKA are spiritual Centres; again confirmed our Beloved Guardian.   

BAHÁ-U-LLAH’s Revert: Extension of BAHÁ’Í’S IN THE WORLD UNTIL 500,000 YEARS  

The orders of our HOLY BOOK, said our Beloved Guardian; are only for 1000 years and it is possible that after 1000 years we might have new orders and New advents; but for 500,000 years no prophet who could be compared with His Holiness BAHÁ-U-LIAH will appear in the world.  

We will witness the coming of prophets during this period; said our Beloved Guardian but all of them will be under the guidance of his Holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH.  

### THE REGISTRATIONS OF THE BRANCHES OF NATIONAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLIES IN THE HOLY LAND 

Now we have 10 National Spiritual Assemblies in the world but in the ten years Crusade we have planned to have another 50; and this will bring the total figure of Our National Spiritual Assemblies to 60: said our Beloved Guardian. In future all the properties & Lands of the HOLY-LAND will be registered in the name of these 60 national Spiritual Assemblies. Through this registration we will unite the National Spiritual Assemblies of the world together. The National Spiritual Assembly of Japan is one of these Centres and we will register a piece of Land here in its name.  

We have already registered the branches of U.S. A.’s N. S. A.’s here. Later the N.S.A.’s of England; Canada; India; AUSTRALIA and finally ÍRÁN were registered here; said our Beloved Guardian. A piece of land has been purchased here for 28,000 Dollars and it is registered in the as of the IRANIAN BAHÁ’Í’s; but still the IRANIAN government has not recognized the BAHÁ’Í faith.  

### OUR PILLRIMAGE TO HOLY CITY OF AKA

At the order of our Beloved Guardian; we then left for the HOLY CITY of AKA; together with a Group of BAHÁ’Í PILGRIM from U.S.A. and ÍRÁN.  

At entering the city the first thing we did was to visit the GREAT prison of HIS HOLINESS BAHÁ-U-LLAH “GHESHLE”. We were walking in the same dark narrow streets where our Beloved Oppressed APOSTLE; HIS HOLINESS BAHÁ-U-LIAH had walked guarded by the soldiers of the OSMAN Empire. The tick Walls of that historic prison could be seen now from the distant: We are now closer and have entered it through the Front Door.  

While we were entering ha prison old memories came back into our minds; we remembered the period of HIS Holiness when people were forbidden to approach and enter the place.  

We could see shadows of those soldiers accompanying his Holiness and forbidding people to approach HIM: and then we could see among them Mr. JARAH AFANDI who became converted to His Holiness and who prayed that he is given the privilege of serving the cause of GOD. Now his Grand Children are blessed and honored by being privileged to serve the cause of God as Gardeners of the SHRINE OF BAHÁ-U-LLAH.   

We entered the prison with a confused and disordered mind. The humble and sad atmosphere of this prison are signs and symbols of the oppression which our Beloved BAHÁ-U LLAH had endured.   

After going up through narrow and unregular steps; We entered the special room where his Holiness BAHÁ,U-LLAH was prisoned. This Dark and small room is still covered with a rough Mat as a souvenir of those days.  

The OSMAN Empire was in vain using this prison with Tick Wails as a mean to prevent the world from being informed of his appearance and advent. No one knows whether there was ever lamp in this Prison where our Beloved One was prisoned for years; but every observer is sure of one thing and that is: the Sun has never touched HIS PRISON.   

But it was in this dark room that his Holiness made preparations for the salvation of the world: and He set up here and in this dark and sad Room the foundations of an international and world, peace.  

We sat there for some minutes and reminding the oppressions which he had endured said a PRAYER. We worshiped the place and kissed the round; and then we left the prison and went to the HOUSE OF ABBUD.  

### THE HOUSE OF ABBUD

Although His Holiness was a little comfortable here with his family but still the HOUSE a ABBUD was humble small and unsuitable for HIS HOLINESS.   

Our Beloved One lived here with his family for seven years: we saw his BED; hat and several other Items of his Household belongings and furniture: there. We than went to the ROOK where the Holy BOOK KETBE-AGHDASS had descended. It was in this room that the foundation of the NEW ORDER of the world was set up; and the old ORDER was destroyed and abolished. After worshiping the place and kissing its HOLY THRESHOLD we left the HOUSE.   

### THE GARDEN OF REZVAN 

I have not seen a Green grass; said his Holiness BAHÁ-U-LIAH for over 9 years. When his Holiness ABD-UL-BAHÁ heard this ne went and prepared the garden of RUYAN where his Holiness BATA-U-LIAH was walking in it sometimes. Now we had the privilege to walk in this garden: We sat under the Brook where his Holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH used to sit in those times and we were feeling a sort of delight at this simple and yet noticeable privilege. One chair and a BED was left there from his holiness personal belongings: We kissed them. There was also a written Tablet from is Holiness there; we read it and while reading it; it ware as if his Holiness is present there and is watching us. After visiting this Garden we left it to go to the Garden of FERDOWSS.  

### THE GARDEN OF FERDOWSS

The garden of Perdowss has a swimming pool where his Holiness would sit in front of it sometimes: We visited this garden too and enjoyed its beauties.   

### THE MAZRAE MANSION

We then entered the MAZRAE mansion and visited some of the personal belonging of His Holiness BAKA-U-LLAH. It was after this visit that we realized...” that his HOLLINESS was not very comfortable here; the mansion in which he dwelt after his release from prison.  

We saw beautiful views in this Mansion.   

### THE MANSION OF BAHJI

This mansion is a symbol of his kingdom.  

Now there are beautiful gardens and wide avenues with the shadow of big trees in this Mansion; all of which have come into existence through the special attention which our Beloved Guardian is paying to the residence of HIS HOLINESS.   

The beautiful flowers & the extraordinary Handsome Statues of the mansion took our breath away from us. The wide avenues shadowed with its big trees are something which a visitor can never forget.  

The Mansion is lighted with strong projectors in the evenings. We visited it in the evening when all its gardens were full of light.  

We then visited the ROOMS of the mansion one by one. In the HALL of the mansion were the certificates of the registrations which the governments of the world had issued in recognition to the BAHÁ’Í faith and religion.  

There was a written Document from every country; & pictures of His Holiness family were decorating the HALL. We visited all the rooms until we entered the private ROOM of His Holiness. This is the same Room where the British Professor and Historian BROW 14 had been presented to His Holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH and who said; when visiting his Holiness BAHÁ-U-LIAH I could obviously see that kings of countries were envying me as I was visiting the King of the Kings and the One WHOSE Kingdom is eternal.  

The Bed of his holiness was still in this room and his slippers were laid down near it. Also there we could see his het hanged in his sitting place. All the rooms were lighted with electricity except this ROOM which had still a petrol lamp in it as a matter of tradition and remembrance of those Old historic days. We were all confused; our minds could not work any longer. Are we the humble servants of our Master here present in this Historical PLACE.   

### THE SHRINE OF BAHÁ-U-LLAH

At intending to enter the SHRINE we first made a tour around it humbly until we came to a street which was leading from us to the DOOR of the Shrine. Far away we could see the SIGN BAHÁ-U-LLAH set up on the top of the entrance.  

MY GOD what an extreme happiness THOU has given to us; we said; while crossing these streets. Beautiful Statues and Big Bowls of flowers are located on both aides of the streets. They are wide and beautiful and it appeared to us that somehow our Beloved Guardian has provided them for the future KINGS who will come to pay HOMAGE and pilgrim to this HOLY SHRINE and who will walk through these streets.  

We were approaching toward the SHRINE humbly. All the way to the SHRINE we were praying humbly until we reached the DOOR of the Shrine. We took off our shoes and the door of the Urine was opened unto us. All the Shrine was lighted and full of flowers- and the whole place wee smelling with a sort of Fine Spiritual scent which I am unable to explain it in words. This scent and the spiritual HOLY Atmosphere of the SHRIAS took our souls to Evan right in the presence of his Holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH. Automatically our heads bowed and we kissed this sacred place which had been kissed so many times by our Beloved ABD-UL-BAHÁ and Our beloved Guardian We were wondering in heaven; soul and BODY now: I wish all our BAHÁ’Í friend could be here to sea what a privilege we have had at this moment. We prayed for all the people of the world asking OW to grant them the same privilege and blessings.   

### OUR NIGHT STAY IN THE BAHÁ’Í MANSION

Every Pilgrim is allowed; through the kindness of our Beloved Guardian to sleep one night in the BAHÁ’Í Mansion. But here a special blessing case to us from our Beloved Guardian.   

It was Dr. LUTFOLLAH HAKIN who gave us this good news; “that our Beloved Guardian has given orders… that I might be allowed to spend the evening alone in the reception ROOM of his Holiness .BAHÁ-U-LLAH. My wife too was allowed to spend the evening at the special ROOM which our beloved Guardian had in the Mansion of BAHJI. This good piece of news rind a great and surprising effect on me and my wife and we were almost going to faint from the extras pleasure which this good piece of news had b t to us. We were both crying like children when we had leave our companion pilgrims to go to our ROOMS.  

I can find no words to explain the blessings and privilege which we have had in those two ROOMS. It was something beyond explanation and a whole BOOK will net suffice to express and explain those merciful and kind blessings and the privilege which had come to us during that night. We could see all the profits of GOD in the presence of his holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH.  

It was for such occasions that the Iranian PORT said:  

•	Like MOSES all the prophets of GOD are here standing before THOU And all of them are impatient to see THOU  

•	I am also among them; among THY LOVERS  

•	But if THOU would refuse to show THYSELF to me; I won’t leave THY  

•	I will stay and stay until I see THY   

We were praying and worshiping Gad all that night and this was the only night in our lives which will be remembered throughout all our lives.   

From the special blessings extended to us during that night we hope that we may all succeed in our pioneering service all over the world.   

### THE EFFECT OF AKA VISIT

Have you visited all the places; asked us our Beloved Guardian; after returning to HIM? Have you enjoyed this visit?; he again repeated? Have you kissed all the HOLY thresholds?  

“Yes” I replied; but in all these HOLY PLACE we were first seeing THOU; and then we were kissing these HOLY PLACES. Whenever we were with THOU; the guardian of the cause of GOD. AL11 your thoughts must be toward the SHRINE only; replied our Beloved Guardian; at this. have you prayed for all your JAPANESE friends; ne then asked us? Our beloved Guardian; I replied. Were you very glad at seeing all these HOLY PLACES he then asked?   

We do not deserve all these kindness and affection: we had not done anything to deserve all THOU blessings; I replied. This is the reward of your sincere and faithful service in the FAR EAST; in TOKYO and is other JAPANESE cities and also the reward of your service in other countries replied our Beloved Guardian. I was standing humbly before HIM and felt a sort of shyness at hearing all this from our Beloved Guardian.   

Your services are very important; said our Beloved Guardian; since the organizations of JAPAN must help us in the latter of establishing the International house of JUSTICE.  

### OUR FAREWELL

The time of Fare well bad come. The period of our stay in the dreamed paradise had come to an, end. Our Beloved Guardian called us alone to his presence to Bid us FAREWELL.  

At entering the ROOM I throw myself at his feet; embraced them and started kissing his feet. God forbid it; was saying Our Beloved Guardian. Do stand to BID Fare-Well to me. HIS behavior was similar to His holiness ABD-UL-BAHÁ’s treatment with the PILORIAB. When I stood up; I saw my wife too had entered the ROOM. And since she intended to throw hers unto his feet; our beloved Guardian opened his hand and kept them before her so that she may not be able to throw herself at his FEET. But my wife who was on her knees now was crying and asking HIM to be allowed to kiss his FEET. The more he was preventing her the more lens would cry and beg HIM. I was witnessing am astonishing sight. It was the scene of an Ant asking to throw itself at SOLOMONS FEET.  

Our Beloved Guardian was saying: “this is prohibited but my wife was saying: My soul be sacrificed to THY; allow to kiss THOU feet; to throw myself under THOU PUT only Once. The argument was going on for several minutes and at the end my wife’s devotions and her sincere prayings touched his ocean of mercy and no removed his hands; and my ‘t4’0AIiin,nerself on his FEET. After kissing his feet my wife and I were ordered to sit; and while we were both crying from joy and happiness; Our Beloved Guardian said Thanks to GOD that you have succeeded and have come at visited tee HOLY LAND and enjoyed tae spiritual breeze of the SHRINE.   

I was very eager to see you: fie said then: I had always blessed your sincere service and praise to GOD that you have succeeded and are both: the organizer of the faith of GOD and its teacher in JAPAN.   

Be sure of the future and give confidence to everyone that the future of JAPAN is bright.   

We have nothing: we are week; and need THOU guidance and blessings; we said while we were both weeping. Be sure that the blessings of his holiness BAHÁ-U-LLAH are with you; said our Beloved Guardian. Row it is the beginning of the organization of JAPAN; and you have succeeded in such a difficult time. Japan will make great progress especially now that the National Spiritual Assembly is to be set up there. This Rational Spiritual Assembly is one of the foundations of the International house of Justice. The faith of GOD will be extended from JAPAN to all the surrounding Islands and it will then be extended to RUSSIA  

All the population of JAPAN: 90 million people are anxious and in need of THOU blessings and guidance; I said to our Beloved Guardian. Give assurance to all of them; said our Beloved Guardian that I will pray for you and for the population of JAPAN: especially when I go to the Shrine of Báb. The pioneering of our believers to JAPAN is very important; then added our Beloved Guardian.   

In your way to JAPAN; in ÍRÁN; India encourages our friends to pioneer to JAPAN; specially you must encourage our BAHÁ’Í friends in ÍRÁN and give them the good news of the HOLY-LAND. Then our Beloved Guardian stood up with the purpose to leave us: he came near and kissed me; again and while leaving us his voice of Blessing was repeatedly heard to assure us of HIS blessings until he disappeared. We then did not hear his BOLT voice; neither saw his HOLY face again; or his walking away from us: but his Bright and HOLY FACE were engraved in our hearts; and we hope to keep this spiritual blessing and wealth throughout all our lives. I forgot to mention that at the time of leaving um he said give my love and blessings to our Old and New JAPANESE friends; especially to Miss. Alexander and Mr. Robert Imagire.   

(End)  

------
Translation of a letter dated 6th January 1956 written by Mr. Núri’d-Dín Momtazi from Ṭihrán to his son Bouhollah on the instruction of the Guardian.  

If I wrote thousands of letters like this I would still not be able to explain one thousandth part of the men, and bounties that we received. To see the face of our Gordian ammo is enough for a whole life time. The tidings which we heard frail his make our spirits cheerful therefore; we prayed that all the friends in Japan might receive the same bounty and succeed in visiting our Guardian. The very day that the Guardian explained about the future of the Faith, especially in Japan, we felt special jay, sad told the Guardian of my deep feeling that I wished to cable to the friends in Japan and let than know the inspiring news as soon as possible. Guardian replied it is better to write them and explain.  

The following is a brief report:  

1. Guardian is especially very, very happy, and it is not now possible to explain.  

2. Guardian made special reference to Japan and each time we visited him told us “Japan will be same as Africa. Bahá’u’lláh said “If they want to conceal the light in to this land it will rise from the sea. And call I am the reviver of the world.” Then Guardian said, “this is a reference to Írán and Japan. Recently the enemies of the faith tried to persecute the friends in Írán, but now the light of the faith of Bahá’u’lláh has arisen from Japan, which is the ocean. Japan will be the forerunner of guiding human beings spiritually and Japan will revive mankind.”  

We told him now in Hiroshima there is a Bahá’í Group, and they have a Bahá’í Center. He became very happy and said the Japanese believers have to work for the Faith themselves and you must encourage them.” He said that we in Japan have nothing, however, the Faith has spread. He said, “this is because of obedience to the administrative order” (As yesterday he had explained to us the importance of obedience and also about the Will and Testament.)   

About the election of NSA be specially gave instruction I shall explain When I am in Japan. The essence of said Wit is that the only centers which can send delegate for the election of the NSA in IW are those which have an LSA in 1966. We asked about the centers which do not have enough believers to establish an L.S.A and he said “they are deprived and this is for encouraging the friends to try to have enough believers for an L.S.A in 1956.  

The Guardian instructed us on the way back to Japan to visit the friends of Írán, Pakistan, India & Hongkong, therefore we have to do that. We told him about the new believer, Mr. Sako. Guardian said “assure him that I will pray for him.”   

The Guardian said “I will instruct the friends in the Islands around Japan to attend the convention when the N. S. A is to be formed in Japan. I shall give special instruction in the regard later. Each time the Guardian was telling us about Japan his face was full of joy and he was actually seeing the bright future of the Faith in that country.  

At the time of leaving we were weeping, end told him we have nothing in Japan and time is short, we need inspiration. He answered, “Assure all the Japanese believers they will have it”   

The good tidings about the spreading of the Faith all over the world which we heard from the Guardian were the following:  

1. The countries which up to this time have been opened to the Faith are 242. The countries planned to be opened to the Faith during the 10 year crusade are 131, and 111 of them have been opened within 3 years. When he was saying this he was very, very happy.  

2. The races which have cons into the Faith are 40.   

3. The languages in which the Bahá’í Literature has been translated are 190.   

4. The Bahá’í Centers up to this time are 3700, 1600 Centers are in United States, 750 Centers in Írán, 400 in Africa, 100 in Canada, 100 in England and the balance in other countries.  

5. The total Ḥaẓíras which were to bought during the 10 year crusade were 60, and now 32 have been bought already. He said “the enemy destroyed the dome of one Ḥaẓíra in Ṭihrán, but 32 Ḥaẓíras were bought in other parts of the world.”  

6. The Islands which have been opened to the Faith are 90. 30 were opened daring 100 years and 60 Islands have been opened in last 3 years. About the future institutions on Mount Carmel the Guardian explained to us and shall tell you about them in Japan. One of those is the International Archives which has 62 columns; 7 of them have been already erected. Bash of the columns is 7 esters in height an 71 tons in weight. The other institutions are the Guardianship, the Sands oaf the Cause, the International House of Justice, end the Institute of Higher Sciences. These I shall explain to you when I am in Japan. The other splendid building is the Mother of Temples in Holy Lend which will be built on the top of Mount Carmel. 7. The other news is that in all Islámic entries, be separate from Government. In Egypt they have already separated and no transaction will be made through the religious Notary Public. He said “in Írán and other countries it will be the same in future.”

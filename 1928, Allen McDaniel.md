### Arrival
 
Monday, Feb. 6, 1928. 

We arrived at Haifa at 10 A.M. and were met at the station by that remarkable "magor domo" of Bahá’í life at the Persian Colony, Pugeta.Under his guidance we were piloted, out of the clamoring throng of porters, dragomen, hotel representatives and vendors to a motor care Seated amongst our nine varieties of luggage, we were soon whisked an a picturesque winding road along the hillside. A sudden turn in the road brought us our first view of Mt. Carmel, and in a moment we were descending from our petrel driven vehicle in front of the 2ilgrim House. Here we were welcomed by cheerful greeting of Effie Baker, whose cordial hospitality soon made us feel very much at home.   

### Pilgrim House

The interior of the Pilgrim house expresses in a simple dignified and beautiful way the spirit of this consecrated place. One enters a central hall, flanked on either side by white marble columns, and thru which one has a vista of the hall beyond. Opening off of these side halls are the bed rooms, and at their ends are the sitting and writing rooms and the library. At noon we were welcomed by our beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, His radiant smile and loving greeting immediately won our hearts and put us completely at ease. He inquired after our health and of our trip; expressing great joy at our arrival and the hope that we could make an extended visit. We extended to Shoghi Effendi our humble expression of joy at this blessed privilege, and also the loving greeting and devotion of the friends in the U.S. and Canada( as well as of the friends in Paris) and Egypt, whom we had met on our way to the Holy Land.   

### #10 Temple Basement

During the conference of about 50 minutes prior to lunch, at the Pilgrim House, our Guardian discussed with us in a genera' way the activities of the Cause in America. Among other things he stated: He had received a cable message, from the Chicago mid-year Convention of Jan. 22, 1928 stating that 410,000 had been voted by the delegates for the completion of the Temple Basement so that meetings could be held there. He expressed surprise at this news and a question as to whether the money had been raised by special contribution at the Convention or the vote was to appropriate this large sum from the General Fund. In view of the limited resources in the Fund and the failure of the believers to raise about 4300,000 in the two years that have elapsed since the Plan for Unified Action was established, He expressed doubts as to the wisdom of this action. He initiated that it would have been well to have referred the matter to him before any definite action was taken, involving a matter of such a great importance and so large a sum.   

### Temple Basement for Meetings

With relation to his recent suggestions – made to Mrs. True and the States – concerning the use of the Temple basement for meetings.. our Guardian stated that. He had expresses the desire that the basement room should he made available as far as practicable under existing conditions and limitations of resources. In no way, should the Chicago Spiritual Assembly interfere with the authority of the National Spiritual Assembly concerning the administration of the Temple.  

Shoghi Effendi emphasized the importance of the supervision of the local Spiritual Assemblies over all local activities, and similarly f the National Spiritual Assembly over activities of a national character and scope. This method of administration be urged as of the greatest importance to being about unified action and the truest d best utilization of our time, efforts and resources.   

Our Guardian expressed joy at learning of the recognition of our organization under the Declaration of Trust by the United States Treasury Dept. He stated that he believed this document to be excellent in its clarity, comprehensiveness and expression. Copies are being made in Persian and. Arabic to be sent to the Assemblies to the Eastern Countries to serve as a model for similar instruments in their respective communities. He expressed especial approbation of the simplicity of the form and language used in the Declaration of Trust. Our Guardian's earnest wish is for the early completion and adoption of the complete instrument of administration including the Declaration of Indenture, and the recognition of this document by the Federal Government.   

### Mish S. School Races

We told our Guardian out the development of the Sunday School in Washington, and of the Young Peoples’ class. Shoghi Effendi inquired, as to whether the colored children attended with the white. He urged the association of the races especially among the young children, with whom racial prejudices were lacking or undeveloped. As to association of the races, he urged caution and wisdom so as to avoid the arousing of antagonisms and misunderstandings. Believers rusticate in our hearts all racial prejudice as a preliminary step for racial amity.  

### Advisory Group

The discussion of the work of the N.S.A. on the national incorporation led our Guardian to suggest the national and local assemblies employ and utilize the best talent available-outside of the Cause if necessary – in order to carry on most effectively the activities. For example the N.S.A. might find it advisable to have an advisory group of able business men, on purely technical matters. The advice of such a group should be considered but not necessarily adopted.

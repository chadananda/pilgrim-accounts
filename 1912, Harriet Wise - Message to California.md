“Convey to them my greetings and love. It has become necessary to depart for the Orient. Certain obligations have come up, so I must depart for the Orient. I move according to Divine Wisdom. I have infinite longing to meet you, but what happens now is according to Divine Wisdom, that is, I must depart for the East. Although I leave yet my heart is with you. There is no separation between us and I am never free from mentioning your names. It is my hope that you may attain to such a condition that you may enjoy daily visits with me and that you may become characterized with the characteristics of the spiritual ones, may become illumined with the fire of the love of GOD to such an extent that you may wholly inflame the region of California. I am ever anticipating receiving good news from you, that you may impart to me happiness. Although I did not travel as far as California, yet I supplicate at the threshold of Abhá that, through the efforts of the believers of GOD and the maid-servants of the Merciful, that region may become illumined. This is My Message. This is like meeting – there is no difference. (Face is a glorious smile.) When you return to them you must breathe into them a new breath”  

“All your efforts must be expended in two ways - one in giving the Message, the other in loving ,each other, and through these two ways will the divine banner be raised and the world of humanity attain to the summit of perfection.”   

“His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh accepted much trouble and all persecutions in order to bring harmony and love among the hearts of humanity. We must exercise ourselves with heart and soul in order that these two important questions in the world of humanity may raise this divine banner. You see how the darkness has overcome; notwithstanding this is the century of light. The wrist of humanity at present is in darkness; you must be inflamed. Everything can be attained through the love of GOD. The hearts must be inflamed just like a fire. When the love of GOD inflames our hearts and leaves the attachment of this world and becomes pure and holy, one human (person) can illumine all the world. Every great work, every great deed, is done through sacrifice. Is it possible for a man to be near the threshold of GOD and be attracted to this world? Some want both physical luxuries and the bounties of GOD. These two cannot be joined. After he experiences real spiritual luxuries and divine happiness it is impossible for him to attach his heart to this world. Attachment to this world is becoming to animals, not to man. Every soul whom you see is attached to this world and always thinking about his luxuries and comfort, know that he has no portion from the Kingdom of Abhá. And when from anyone you be the voice of sanctity and holiness, who is not thinking about himself, and has no other aim except spreading the Cause, no desire but the love of GOD, know that he is near to Bahá’u’lláh.  

### Words spoken in Riverside Park.

“In every moment you must thank GOD a hundred thousand times. Consider how today all the worldly people are deprived of these fragrances and you are specialized for this bestowal and favor. All of them are submerged in a sea of darkness, but you are enveloped in a sea of light. All are blind, but GOD has given you the power of sight. All are deaf, GOD has made you hearing. All are speechless, GOD has given you the power of eloquence .All are dead. GOD has quickened you. He has opened before your faces a door to all His favors. Therefore you must live in the greatest happiness.  

The English and Persian languages are derived from the same root language. New York means royal city palace.  

GOD willing some day we, will gather in the garden or GOD, Mt. Carmel, as we sat on the bench. Materialists are searching for knowledge underground. They are like worms beneath the ground, while the spiritual souls are like birds soaring in the air.  

### July 15th, at Mrs. Krug’s.

I am so pleased. Your hearts are illumined. This assembly is really illumined and divine gathering. You are only thinking of GOD. None of you any other purpose than the mention of GOD. There are two kinds of thankfulness. There is the verbal, which is confined simply to utterance it is of no importance. His tongue is thankful, but his heart is unaware. Many people of the world offer such thanks. Their spirit and heart are not aware. It is a usage, a word without significance. One may say it a thousand times, then the heart is thankless and that verb thankfulness is without effect. Nay, rather, the real is thankfulness is when man responds to GOD’s favor; then his heart is happy, his spirit is exhilarated, and the real thankfulness is comprised in deeds and the gratitude is felt in actions. Certain deeds must emanate from him. He must arise to achieve certain deeds and actions. He must be self-sacrificing, kind to all the servants, nay, even forfeit his very life. He must be kind to all, severed from the world; his face radiant; his tongue illumined. Day and night he must strive to attain to the good pleasure of GOD. You must read the Tablets, Hidden Words, Iskrakat, and act according to them. This is real thanksgiving. This is the divine bestowal. I hope you will attain to this and be ever mindful of these favors.  

### July 17th.

You must always be happy. GOD is kind. He is more kind than a father. Whenever we experience unhappiness, we must turn our faces to GOD, for He is kind and compassionate, and undoubtedly the sorrow will be changed into joy. Therefore we must be happy. Happiness must be in GOD. When people happy in wealth, wealth may disappear, When they are happy in children, the children say die. If it is luxury, It may be taken away. Therefore, eternal happiness is impossible for man except in GOD. GOD’s compassion is everlasting. Therefore His happiness is eternal and everlasting it is not subject to change or transformation. That is why the sanctified ones and prophets never entertained unhappiness, because their happiness came from GOD. Yours must be from GOD, so that it may become perennial.  

### July 18th, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in bed.

This time I want to send you with a new spirit, a new strength, to enlighten California, and to engage in teaching the Cause in the utmost power. Do not look to yourselves; look to the Bounty of Bahá’u’lláh; constantly leak to His Favor. Do not say you have not capacity; look to the great bounties of Bahá’u’lláh. One seed becomes a big harvest, a email seed a big tree, one wave an ocean, He makes the dark dust a beautiful garden, This is His power. You must rely upon Him and look to His confirmation and power. Open your tongues with utmost spirit, courage, force and power. Then you will see what will happen, Turn your faces to the Blessed Perfection and whatever comes to your lips or minds, speak. Teach in this way. GOD has given power to others; He will give it to you. In past ages, consider how He gave, in the time of Christ, of Muḥammad and of Moses. He will also give you the greatest power, Consider how Mary Magdalene was only a peasant girl. I hope through the Favors of GOD, you may become ignited candles.  

### July l9th,

There is a spiritual understanding or communication. You are always associating or affiliating with Me. Although of outwardly far away physically, but in spirit you are near. Therefore it is My hope that on your return, each one of you may become a lighted candle, and enlighten the souls with the light of guidance. Perchance the region of California will become illumined, I send you away. Rest assured in the confirmations of the Blessed Perfection. Your hearts are pure. I bear witness thee you have no other aim but that which is good. Your aim is to serve the Kingdom of GOD. Convey to all the friends My longing greetings. I have longed very much to meet them, but such was the decree to return to the Orient. The Message of My love to the friends of GOD! Tell them today the greatest of all things is to be firm in the Covenant. The point towards which all eyes should gaze is one. All eyes must turn their attention to the Center of the Covenant, while the Presence of the Covenant is amongst us. No soul should have any other existence. All others save the Center of the Covenant are equal. That which issued from the Pen of the Covenant, all must plat so that the fortresses of the Cause of GOD may be protected. I supplicate at the threshold of GOD and beg for you a new confirmation and a new assistance. (Anointed the heeds with perfume and blessed them.) You will be very happy, for I will be with you all the way. You must go with the utmost happiness ape cheerfulness.  

We told Him He must put that happiness into our faces, that others may see it. He said He would do it.   

### July 20th.

I feel a zephyr blowing from the Supreme Kingdom towards America. It will continue to blow. I hope it brings the utmost strength in the Covenant. No matter Low severs the atoms, you must he firm end steadfast. The Covenant is most important. Nothing else is as important, because it is the magnet of confirmation. Bahá’u’lláh mentions it in His Writings. “O GOD, confirm him who is firm in the Movement. If a soul utters a word, without the sanction of the Covenant, he is not firm.” Bahá’u’lláh appointed a Covenant in order to ward off dissensions, so that no one can have his own opinion, so that the Center can be referred to. There were dissentions after Christ, because there was no Center. Did Christ say to anyone, “You are the Center of My Covenant? You are the explainer of My Book?” This is the reality of the question. Whatever the Center of the Covenant says is correct. No one should utter a word of himself Bahá’u’lláh has called down the vengeance of GOD upon anyone who violates the Covenant.  

Firmness in the Covenant is not mere words.  

Beware, beware, lest you be shaken. Remain firm, even if the people of heaven try to shake you. The command is explicit.  

### Extracts from Harriet’s Notes.

### Friday, July 13, 1912.

In regard to the mine ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: “This will be fraught with such trouble, great difficulties. It needs a rich man, a banker, much money. It will slip from your hands. GOD has given you another mine whose ruby is very red and very clear. You need not engage in any trouble in that mine. You must not aspect fruit from a pine tree, You cannot expect to plant such a tree and then pray that GOD Will produce fruit. Rather, plant and water a tree which will bear fruit, like the orange or olive, and then pray for the decent of the rain. Never work with a vision or start a work from a vision. GOD has given us reason. Then every day someone will have a vision.”  

He asked all the business questions, how much we had put in, and then asked Mrs. Goodall why she had invested.  

“Do not depend upon visions. The little money invested will slip away. You cannot accomplish it. It would take a hundred thousand dollars; it needs a million. If it is possible, find a buyer, Is there anyone who would buy it?  

Harriet: “No one that I know of”  

Asked if we would be able to find one. “GOD willing, you shall find one.  

The property will pass into other hands. You must plant a fruitful tree.”  

Harriet: “We thought we had.”  

“You go, and consult afterwards. Always consult me first before you engage in such things.”  

I kissed the hand that sewed to take away all material means, and yet gave me all the real treasure, the immortal.  

### July 13th.

Went over early to help Grace Roberts; dusted the lower rooms, and went up to the truth floor to see what else I could do. As I was quietly slipping down past ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s door, He called me to come in.  

“Are you happy?”, I replied, very happy because I was in His presence. We sat down. In the happiness of it all, I forgot about my own affairs and asked for a special blessing for Mrs. Goodall and Mrs. Cooper and told Him of their great goodness, also of Miss Roberts and Mrs. Haney, then of the family.  

He said, “Your mother must be a good woman, for she has raised such a good daughter. Then He called Mrs. Goodall, Mrs. Cooper, Grace Robarts, Mr. Ober, Mr. St. Clair and myself.  

He said, “My first word should always be carried out.”  

When asked if Mr. St. Clair might help with the housework, He said: “Men are incapable. Woman do things of that kind in a superior way. They have more patience. It is the work of a woman.”  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was silent for a few moments, then spokes “I wish to speak of the mine. Do not let go of it. It will require great expense. Perhaps you can interest some capital outside. Don’t let go of it, but find someone among, the capitalist and keep under your jurisdiction. Consultation is necessary. Do not rely on visions and dreams; be rational. Hold consultations. Always consult, then execute. That is My Will. Your decisions will be my will. Hereafter begin nothing on visions or dreams. When I was a boy, a child was sleeping din an adjoining bed to mine. In the midnight I heard him crying.  

“Why are you weeping?” “I dreamed there was lots of money in my pocket, and woke up and nothing was those.”  

Harriet: “We have been children and dreaming.”  

A. B. “No, this is only an illustration.”  

“Be silent amid the crowds.” Bahá’u’lláh to Hádí.  

In regard to Madam Bethlin. “Don’t give any importance to her; be indifferent. Do not have anything to do with her. She is not well balanced. Do not talk against her, but have nothing to do with her; let her alone.”  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was told she shows her Tablets and says you commanded her to give the Message.”  

A. B.: “I have summoned all to the conveying of the Message.”  

In regard to Shua Ullah (son of Muḥammad-‘Alí, known as Mr. Bahá’í, living in California), “You must not associate with him. No person will remain firm if he associates with him. They are enemies of the Center of the Covenant.”  

In regard to Mrs. Herron: “She is useless, crazy, She irresponsible. You must be indifferent to her, then the will not come. They would spoil the meetings. She is insane. We have tried to be kind to her. It is useless; It is fruitless.”  

True souls must stand together today and must share confidence, hearing upon the Cause in a way to bring about the boat public appearance of conditions which we must ourselves face and act upon.”

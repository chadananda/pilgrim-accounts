### Larry Hautz

### April 1952

Larry had heard that in the Aqdas there was something about superfluous hair. He debated about shaving his own off, but then looked at the passport and saw it had a moustache on and thought it best to leave the moustache on.  He had had a letter, months before from the Guardian saying he hoped he could visit Haifa soon. When Larry heard that it was possible to go to Haifa, he phoned Horace who said, “Yes” Larry asked what to do and Horace said he should write to the Guardian. What to wear, etc., was a question. Larry was told the Guardian would send him details. So he cabled the Guardian and back came the reply: ‘Welcome”. “He flew over and When he landed was greeted “Oriental Style” by Dr. Loftfullah. A little later he was told the Guardian would meet him. He saw the Guardian come toward him... a short man with a moustache just like his. And the Guardian greeted him “Oriental Style.” He said, “You are the first pilgrim — this is a great privilege and also a great responsibility.”  

There was only Kosher meat in Israel 4t that time and not much of that. It order to eat meat, there must be other arrangements because if they ate the usual meat (Kosher) they would be classed as Jews.  

The dining table is rectangular, and the Guardian sits to the right of the head, with Rúḥíyyih Khanun on his right. The guest sits at the head for the first time, and the Guardian serves him. As the guest stays, he moves to the left,-and. the International Council chairman takes the head se-at, ar in his absence. the Vice-chairman.  

Larry was at the table when Ugo Giacheryand Fred Schopflocher were made hands of the Cause. Even Rúḥíyyih did not know about it beforehand. The Guardian lectured to Mr. Sehopflocher for 2 hours on the greatness of Canada, and the next day, two more hours. Then he said, “I know make you a Hand of the Cause.”   

The Guardian has some rugs there that are priceless he referred to the Lost Great Prison as the Most Great Heaven.   

Larry asked to which Intercontinental Conference he should go. The Guardian said, ‘Delhi’.   

Larry was to work with the lawyer .about two covenant-breakers who were right there at the lawyer’s office. Larry asked about counting, the 40 waves at ‘Akká, if it were to be taken literally. The Guardian said it was to give an appreciation of ‘Akká and to turn the Moslems from Mecca to ‘Akká.   

The Aqdas was revealed to the Persians and not us because It was necessary for them to demonstrate the differences between, Bahá’í and Islám such as marriage, time of burial etc.  

When asked how many hands there would be the Guardian said, “Nine, nineteen, even ninety-five.” Every Hand has a particular qualification.. In the future there ‘will be institutional built around the Hands. There will for example, a Bahá’í historian (a. Hand) and all Bahá’ís working on history will Work around this Hand. There will be a Hand for Music.  

The Guardian had to spend one day just answering cablegrams. He said he will have to resort to pilgrims to get messages back to the believers right now.  

The Guardian said the American community has filed to make the proper impression to attract colored Bahá’ís. It would not be surprising if the Africans came to America to talk to people here.   

Bahá’ís everywhere must remember the minority group or organization is the MOST important group. The American Indian is one of the most important minorities.   

Needs: Pioneers with independent means
 
Send information on jobs for pioneers
 
Make friends of Africans here
 
Keep up the morale of pioneers — write letters to them.  

The Shrine of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will be separate from the Shrine of the Báb in years to cone.   

Ignoring of the Faith, repression, emancipation, recognition are the stages in its development.  

Both Houses of Congress in America have passed a bill listing us as an independent Faith. Diplomatic fair-mindedness is needed. The integrity of each Bahá’í must be known to all.   

The peacock (of which the Guardian has four) is the Bird of Paradise.  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Were it not for the activities of the Covenant-Breakers, kings would have made the pilgrimage during the lifetime of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.   

In the Qur’án it refers to the shores of ‘Akká, in preparation of the heart of the individual. It is important to turn the people to ‘Akká.   

Abduil-Bahá said, “Make me happy and you will see what I can do.”  

The gardens are lighted for 3 hours some nights—very beautiful.  

The Guardian told Larry to drive the Rabbání car without ever inquiring first of Larry whether or not he knew how to drive a car.   

The long prayer and the meduim obligatory prayers should be memorized to synchronize the action with the words. They can be said softly or loudly but must be audible. Re: short prayer; we should not be regulated by minimums, de should avail ourselves of this medium with God as often as possible.   

It is possible for the pure of heart to make contact with the spiritual world, but they should not share or exploit it by interceding for others. It is an individual blessing.   

Bahá’u’lláh didn’t send a letter to America when he sent Letters to rulers and leaders. See the Commentary on the Súrah of Joseph: “O people of the West”.  

Bahá’u’lláh speaks of the American continent in the Aqdas. The “Spiritual Mission of America” ‘spoken of in the writings means the mission of the American BAHÁ ‘I community.  

The purchase of land on Mt, Carmel’s slope rose from 100 to 4 million dollars. One of the Covenant-breakers was paralyzed and he lived all these years on Mt. Carmel. The Guardian said that God permitted him to live in that condition so he could witness the growth of the Faith.  

People who visit Haifa and ‘Akká a transformed.  

Reading for inquirers before becoming believers: Íqán, New Era, new copy of Some Answered Questions, Gleanings, Prayers & Meditations, Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh, God Passes By, Dawn breakers, Seven Valleys, Promised Day is come.   

In God Passes By, the Báb addressing Sons of the Kings, warns the Sunis and Caliphate. God would chastise those who took up arms against Imám Ḥusayn.  

The cypress tree (such as those where Bahá’u’lláh sat on Mt. Carmel) were a sign of immortality to the Greeks and Romans.   

The altars in churches are a carry-over from Roman sacrificial altars. We must not use an altar.   

The 12th Imám DIED as a child... he was not mysteriously taken away.  

Rubiyyih means spiritual ( ‘Abdu’l-baha gave her this name). Rabbání means Divine.   

We will have a united world, then interplanetary, then inter-stellar, and then spiritual worlds.  

The Aḥmadiyyihs do not abrogate the Qur’án.  

The Christians accept progressive revelation because they accept Adam, Noah, Moses, Christ. But they think Christ is the final Prophet.  

The Aqdas will not be abrogated in 1,000 years. All divine religions have mysteries. But we should not allow, mystery to become superstition as in Catholicism. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, for instance, is a mystery. The Guardian (not ‘Abdu’l-Bahá) is the successor to Bahá’u’lláh). The only news that really cheers the Guardian’ is news of new LSA’s.  

The Lord’s Prayer. No use to pray the Lord’s prayer because it has already been fulfilled.   

The whole world and even the enemies of the Jews will envy them because of their accomplishments in the holy Land.   

We must not try to convert the Jews but tell them that every Bahá’í is a good Jew. Give them the prophecies in our writings about Israel. If the Bahá’ís work harder, we will still be able to alleviate much suffering. We must seize every opportunity and try to get it across to as many people as possible.   

The Guardian is the least dictatorial, and doesn’t use the power he has.  

The Guardian was criticized for 20 years because some said he had forgotten the Divine Plan of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Now we have the Administration. In the next year we will do in 10 years what we have not been able to do in 100 years. The secret of success in Europe is the Divine Plan and Administration which has already been completed.  

One believer told Bahá’u’lláh about someone who had heard of the Cause and Bahá’u’lláh was elated. When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá heard about the spread of the Cause in some farther spot He was elated. The wealth of the Cause is the blessedness of each individual believers.  

The doors of the Shrine of the Báb are named for the Hands.  

The Hands are independent of Institutions. Eventually the Hands will play the preponderating role in world civilization. The Historian will surround himself with auxiliary institutions and they will write history of the world in a really historical way.  

The pebbles from the Sea of Galilee are in the Shrine Gardens. These are from the spot where Christ told His disciples about His Mission.  

The Guardian said that Rommel in the Holy Land was not tenable with the prophecies of the Bahá’í Faith.  

Every Dispensation abrogates the laws of the former. The Aqdas abrogates the laws of the Qur’án.  

Rúḥíyyih asked the Guardian where something was. He said, “that is in the Archives, the third drawer, below something else.” His memory is remarkable as there were thousands of things there.  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that some people make the pilgrimage physically yet never attain it; and some who never go have attained it.  

The government surveyor, looking over the Bahá’í Gardens said, “How many architects and landscapers did you have?” Larry said, “None. Just the Guardian.” “Impossible” said the surveyor, “No one man could do this.”  

The cab drivers take the tourists to have the Bahá’í gardens because there is no request for money at the gardens as there is also many places in Israel.  

They are neither Persian nor Gardens... they are Bahá’í Shrines.  

Hertzel (of Zionism) who wanted to be buried on Mt. Carmel, was buried in Jerusalem, instead of Mt. Carmel.

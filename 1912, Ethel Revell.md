### of Ethel Revell with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

### in 1912

First saw Him on Pennsylvania Railroad train at North Philadelphia station, rode with Him to Philadelphia Main Station (Broad St. Station). My feelings while waiting for Him could not be described – only after I saw Him I wished the ride might never end.  

The next as y I saw Him in the Unitarian Church, 15th & Girard Avenue, where He spoke. He said He had come from the Orient to the Occident that perchance a bond of unity might be created between the East and the West, etc, After the service, I saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá put his hand on the shoulder of my older brother, who had come to meet Him, although not calling himself a Bahá’í. This was on the sidewalk in front of the church.  

The afternoon found us in the Bittenhouse Hotel – a group of people were present. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá beckoned us to come in, and we went quietly and sat on the floor – all the chairs were occupied.  

He was telling us that Bahá’u’lláh bad sent Him forth as a dove with a Message on His rings - and that message was that He, Bahá’u’lláh had accepted us in His Service.  

In the evening ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke at the Baptist Temple. Dr. Russell H. Conwell, the pastor had visited Him in 1909 (I believe) in prison and bad invited Him to speak in his church at that time, if He were ever liberated. Dr. Conwell said ‘Abdu’l-Bahá needed no introduction – He was known by his audience, and as for the strangers who were present, who did not belong to his congregation, they of course know ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave a wonderful talk in his church – (found in Promulgation of Universal Peace). After the service the audience had the bounty of shaking hands with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and of course I availed myself of this bounty. Monday morning – ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke in our home. I did not hear Him, as my sister and I went to bring an almost-blind lady to the house.  

When we arrived, there were about 50 people present – some on the stairway, some standing in the ball upstairs, waiting for a private minute with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The lady in front of me asked: “Does ‘Abdu’l-Bahá heal?” I answred that I had known of physical illness healed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but that she should talk to Him privately, which she did. She still loves ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and talks of Him, although she has never affiliated her with the Bahá’í Cause. My sister, a distant man cousin and I were the last three to go. We agreed to go in together to see Him, so He might have a minute to rest. My cousin had stomach trouble and told ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of it. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá rubbed His hands over the man. As far as I know he has not been troubled since, with his stomach.  

What an emptiness when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left --- I went to the room where He had been – and wept.  

Later In the day, Mother discovered, after the friends had all departed, the sandwiches etc. she had prepared, but had forgotten about entirely.  

In the summer of 1912, Mother and I went to New York for the day to see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.  

When we went to His room, He was looking at Juliet Thompson’s painting of Himself. I asked Him to bless a stone which I had, and He did. Mother asked Him for a name for my younger sister, and He gave her the name Badia (wonderful). Then He spoke of the friends in Philadelphia very lovingly.  

Visits of E. R. with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. During the summer, one day we received word that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would ride through Philadelphia on his way from Washington, D.C. to New York. About 35 friends gathered at the Station to see Him, each with a tiny gift – a piece of fruit, candy, etc. Some of us boarded the train and rode through the city, getting off at a far station. We crowded about the seat where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was, so that it was with difficulty that the conductor could get through to collect fares, etc. Among us was a Jewish woman in sorrow – having lost her husband and another close relative. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sat her beside Him and showered her with kindness. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was holding a rosary He had carried from Washington, and giving it to Mother, He told her to distribute the beads on it among the friends.  

The train we were on was an express to New York, but when we came to our station, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to the door or the train with us, shook hands with each one, and had quite a conversation with some. I recall the lady in front of me had a tiny daughter called Edria. She told ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of the name, and He talked with her about the name.  

In November, sister of mine, Mary, and I went to New York for the day to see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. When we went in to see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He said many things too high for me to take in, but I do remember He said many times, “Good daughters, very good daughters, you are my good daughters.” We were happy indeed.  

When we care out, we sat outside the door with Mrs. Brittingham and watched each one as he or she went in, and then the change in each person on coming out.  

It as wonderful.  

In the afternoon, Mrs. Brittingham took us to Mrs. Krug’s, where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke. Krug lowered the window, thinking ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would be cold, as He was near it, but He opened it again saying: “Good air. Good air.” After the meeting, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walked over to one lady, and said: “My ancient friend.” In the evening, before leaving for Philadelphia, we again went to 305 W 78th St. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was having tea with the Persian believers. He had tea served to us too – weak tea, in glasses. He said in English: “Persian tea.”  

Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to His room, and permitted us to follow for our farewell. He was very kind, very gentle with us. My sister sat beside Him – I sat opposite Him and tried to get every opportunity I could to fix the picture of Him in my mind – for eternity although He was always looking straight at me, and I knew He knew all I had done and would do.  

Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arose, and. went to another part of the room, and brought a box of candy, giving it to my sister, and saying to her: “Share it with the friends. He gave me a jar of preserves and said, “Keep this yourself.” my sister wept – I did not exactly feel like weeping – I felt more like telling everyone what we had – but I looked at her and wept, too.  

Dr. Ba<u>gh</u>dádí took us to a rear room to get calmed. He gave each a hair of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and was very kind to us.  

When going downstairs, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to Dr. Ba<u>gh</u>dádí, which he interpreted for us: “Tell them I will always be with them.”  

### Further accounts of visits of Ethel Revell with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

In the summer of 1912, Mother and I went to New York for the day, to see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. I remember so clearly, as I neared New York, thinking: “The Best Beloved of God is here in this city.  

Somehow - I do not remember how - we reached 309 West 78th Street. Many friends were gathered. After a time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent for Mother and me. Re was sitting, at a window, and had beside Him the painting by Juliet Thompson of Himself.  

Mother asked, in this interview, for a name for my younger sister Rebecca, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave her the name “Badia” (meaning wonderful).  

I asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá if He would bless a stone I had, which He did.   

I do not remember more of this visit - I was too exalted; but I know He spoke of the Assembly in Philadelphia, and praised it.

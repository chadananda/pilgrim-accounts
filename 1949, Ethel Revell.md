### 1949

My first glimpse of ‘Abdu’l’-Bahá was in a Pennsylvania Railroad train, going from North Philadelphia Station to Broad Street Station, on Saturday afternoon, June 8, 1912.  

Shall I ever forget that days I recall that I could scarcely keep myself together – I felt my body would fly to pieces with joy, as I awaited the hour, and especially while walking to the station - a walk of perhaps 5 minutes.  

I had dreamed of Him, I had longed for Rim, I had spoken of Him to people, and now I was to nee Him, — the One who had guttered all His life to show us what a real life should be. I cannot explain how I felt - expectant, eager, yes -- and yet I had always felt I was near Him.  

We entered the train. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was sitting at a window, and had the shade drawn down quite far. With Him were, I believe, Mrs. Getsinger, Mrs. Boyle and some of the Persian men believers.  

I sat in the seat behind Rim, after shaking Nis hand. Such joy! just wished the ride might never end.  

When a child, I had attended a Baptist Church – and used to sit in my class and with the Christ would come again; and. I recall yet, as though it were yesterday, that though only a child of about 9 or 10, I then solemnly promised myself that if He should come and I should learn of it during my life, I would give up everything to serve Him.  

We arrived at the station all too quickly. We all walked through the waiting room, and sat down – I believe I was about 3 or 4 seats from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He sat there a few minutes and then left for the Rittenhouse Hotel in an automobile. We followed; but t‘Abdu’l-Bahá retired immediately, as he was weary from the day.  

On Sunday morning, June 9, 1912, I again saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at a Unitarian Church at 15th and Girard Avenue. It was Children’s Day, and I was so happy to see the children present.  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that He had come from the orient to the occident that perchance a bond of unity might be created between the east and the west. (see P.U.P.)  

After the service, I saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walk to the street and put His hand on the shoulder of my older brother, who had come to meet Him, although not calling himself a Bahá’í. This made me very, very happy.   

I do not recall whether I returned home after the morning church service or not, but I do know that the afternoon found us with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Rittenhouse Hotel.  

As we entered - there being a group of people present, we hesitated, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said we should come in. We quietly walked in and eat, on the floor opposite Him.  

He was saying that Bahá’u’lláh had sent Him forth to us as a dove with a message on His wings -- and that Message was that He, Bahá’u’lláh had accepted us in His service. Such a precious message!  

Then he spoke to the brother of Mr. Charles Mason Remey - telling him of the condition of the people - how they do not recognize the great ones in their day; but afterwards they worship the ground they trod, etc.   

Again I have no recollection of what happened until I found myself riding in a street car toward the Baptist Church where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was to speak in the evening.  

The minister of the Baptist Temple, Broad and Berks Streets, at that time , the late Dr Russell H. Conwell, had visited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in ‘Akká in prison; and had invited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at that time, to come to his church and speak, if he were ever liberated, and should journey to America; which invitation ‘Abdu’l-Bahá graciously accepted.  

Dr. Conwell gave a very wonderful introduction, saying that to his people ‘Abdu’l-Bahá needed no introduction as He was already known; and that the ones who were present who did not belong to his congregation of course knew ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.  

‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke at length on the principles in a very wonderful talk. (See P.U.P.)  

After the service, Dr. Conwell took ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in to his study, where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá shook hands with those wishing to meet Him.  

I too stood in line and took His hand, and then stood at a short distance, watching the others, and wishing 1had more capacity to understand more fully the importance of those minutes.  

Again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was whirled away to the hotel.

On another occasion she asked ‘Abdu’1-Bahá if he was the Christ. Immediately the figure of ‘Abdu’1-Bahá was replaced by a tree in which stood a blazing fire.

She walked up Mount Carmel to the Báb’s Tomb. She prayed so earnestly that if this Message was the truth For God to send her a sign!

A dove flew to her and nestled on the bosom of her dress. 

Mrs. Parsons ‘Abdu’1—haga told her to teach the poor; even those she could not reach. Then in a dream, it came to her that the “poor” where those of her own station in life She won the co-operation of her natural associates in humanitarian work first, then won them for the Faith.

An American pilgrim spent two months in Haifa. There was one humble insignificant soul who never seemed to perform any service or partake of any of the meetings except to pour rose-water over the hands of the visitors as they passed out of the Master’s presence. The American said, “I’ve forgotten the faces of all the other’s present, except his face.”

Mrs. Morton visited Haifa when suffering greatly from ulcers.

Sitting at the Master’s table for her first meal, she wondered if she dared eat of the pilau which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had set before her. She struggled through it; then He set a second plate before her and told her to eat. This she felt sure would cause her great suffering, but she wished to obey her Lord. The third time, a plateful was set before her. She thought,”I will surely die obeying my Lord!” In the morning she awoke, free from pain for the first home in months — he: ulcers had disappeared!

# Utterances of our Blessed Master, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in His Exact Words  
## Breakwell, Hopper, Brittingham  
### September, 1901 

------

The Master said that the differences between this Revelation and that of Jesus Christ are that, in this Cycle, all the inhabitants of the world will be gathered into one nation; universal peace will prevail; bloodshed and war will cease; there will be a general language; union and harmony will reach the highest state; there will be no bigotry. All will be gathered under the tent of peace. Before the universal peace is established there will be wars and a general overturning of society. These wars are to warn the people, so that they may learn, if they do not follow the teachings, they will be punished, for the power of the Spirit will be taken from them and they will become as lamps without light.   

The differences between this Manifestation and that of Jesus Christ are:   

1st. The teachings of Christ amounted to a very few pages, but the teachings of the Manifestation, Bahá’u’lláh amounted to twenty books.   

2nd. The teachings of the Manifestation are greater than the teachings of Jesus Christ. For example, from the teachings of the Manifestation you can do everything; they include everything.   

3rd. Apparently Jesus Christ was opposed by the Jews only, but the Manifestation was opposed by the whole universe. Jesus Christ, on account of injury from the Jews, and their opposition, used to go from one place to another, but that the Manifestation stood before all was evident, as He was seen by all and did not hide Himself, even in a village. At all times He said, “I am ready”. He wrote to the King of Persia; “Let all the divines and doctors of law assemble together and discuss the matter with Me, and I am ready to prove it”.   

4th. In the time of Jesus Christ the greatest one of the disciples was Peter, yet he denied his Master three times. But the followers of Bahá’u’lláh under the most severe torture, were repeating the Name of Bahá’u’lláh and never denied it, not only one, a hundred or a thousand, but twenty thousand followers hastened thus to martyrdom.   

5th. The Cause of Jesus Christ existed for three hundred years before it became known, but the cause of the Manifestation, in the day of the Manifestation, was known all over the world.   

6th. Jesus Christ came to establish proofs of the Old Testament, and this was for the Jews, a consequently His opposers were few, But the Manifestation came for all the world, and for all religions, and to explain all the Holy Books of those religions. Another proof was that during the imprisonment of the Manifestation the Governor and Officials were His humble servants. Even His enemies were submissive to Him. Because the Cause of the Manifestation is universal, it will envelop the world.   

7th. The miracles which appeared through the Manifestation the Master did not like to mention, because they will not be proof to others. They were only a demonstration for those who witnessed them. If the Master mentions all of these, the people will say that the idol worshipers attributed many wonderful things to their idols. The hearer will say that is right and this is wrong. While the miracles which actually appeared in the time of the Manifestation are greater than all, the Master did not wish o mention them, for the Manifestation said that the miracles would be like a veil over the people, for in every time, the proofs (of this Word) will be so evident and clear that the people can understand them.   

The Master said, if anyone asks you about the Manifestation, say He is the Trainer of the whole universe. His Teachings are the cause of the life of the worlds, the unity and harmony of the creatures, the agreement of the people, and the universal peace.   

Every great thing of which we hear, and every great event in the world must have something that will stand steadfastly for it and to defend it. The greatness of the Cause will be as a flood. It will be like the waves of the Pacific Ocean. No other waves are as large. If the Cause is firm and on a good foundation, all these events which take place will be the cause of its assistance and promulgation. When the winds blow severely, the small trees will be uprooted, but the fixed and large trees will remain firm. This illustration is in harmony with this Cause. It must have great assistance. The opposition and rebellion of the people will be ver great indeed, but power for the Truth. Thus, if we see that the nations and people act and exert their utmost to destroy this Cause becomes illuminated. So all must be like confirmed mountains; fixed and firm believers; but we must act through consciousness and wisdom. All of our deeds must be done in kindness. We must not fling wisdom away, but we must always seize it. Be assured and confident that the assistance of God will be poured out upon you. The servants of GOD are the victors and they are the hosts of GOD. Meditate upon the time after Christ and upon this time and you will understand.   

Once the Manifestation was imprisoned and chains were around His neck. At this time the Master was with some of the believers in another place, and the people finally captured Him also. The boys of this place gathered together and began to beat Him; about two or three hundred children surrounded Him. It may come to pass that the people will curse the believers, beat them, injure them, abuse them and do harm to them, and even cause animosity between them. GOD willing that you may be steadfast and firm and never be shaken. But under all kinds of tribulation you must always keep in mind the LOVE of the Master and remember to what a great degree He loves you.   

Explanation of the First Portion of the Second Commune, which is taken from the
“PRAYER OF THE DAWN”   

This “Letter” means a person. As the Word came forth from the Mouth, that person is the reflection of the Light of GOD. It is the Letter in which all the mysteries of the Holy Books. It is the Letter that came forth from the Mouth of the Blessed Perfection. “The seas moved” — the seas of existence; the seas of life; the seas of science; the seas of knowledge; the seas of understanding; the seas of the Love of GOD rolled. “The wind did blow” — these breezes are the causes of life to the trees. These are the fragrances which will revive the beloved of the Kingdom of GOD, and which will cause the fragrance to exhale from them.   

“The fruits appeared” — the new conditions upon he earth began to manifest and appear.   

“The trees began to thrive” — the trees are the people in the Paradise of ABHÁ, who, through the fragrance of this letter will be nourished.   

“The traces were destroyed” — these are the ancient traces which are destroyed by the Light. For example, the radiance of the Sun will destroy the sparkling of the star.

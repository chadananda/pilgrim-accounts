### Extract from a letter written to Frau Consul Schwarz by Mírzá A. S. Bahadur.

On the 13rd, of December (G915) r. Shonki, Nab. bani his grandson and I, left here and after thirty hours of continuous journey we were honored in the Holy Presence* I kissed His feet, but in doing so I had the,feeling that I was doing so in behalf of all the dear German brethern.  

I offered to Him the letters I had received wish my mail for Him, with the translations, He read them thvou and was most delighted. Then, turning to a great Bahá’í teacher who has lately come from home to visit Him, said: Take.these, and read them and see how pure and sincere they are. That friend asked if he could copy the translations. He granted per nission to him, Then the Master went on praising them saying: T There are many on the battleifields performing their au. ties, loyally 66 their. Government, to their country and also their duty to GOD. Eveh on the battlefield they are in viting and leading their fellow en to the Kingdom of GOD. Really their characters are admirable.  

I spoke about my father, Consul Bchwarz, that he had „sent for sotto spiritual literature to study and teach his co.officers, He said: Yes, I know, he is very active, steadfast and sincere and aided by divine confirmations.  

I was in the Holy Presence for four days, Some letters came from America, I translated and presented them to lam, After having read them He turned to me and said: The letters which come from the German friends give me the greatest joy because the stifling air of violation of the Covenant of GOD has not permeated into that country, Thry are pure and unstained. I have often said that their pro► greys will be great and rapid after this war is over*  

Then I asked for a few Tablets of which one might be common for all. lie accepted, At noon being cal. led, to take tea with Him, I was going to have the Tablets when unfortunately some intruder came and occupied the time till sunset; when we were obliged to bid farewell to Him and come and join our lessons, On my departure He said: Write answers to the letters of the dear German friends and tell them that I am well, Although material communication is cut off and no proper and sufficient cor.. respondence, yet they are always in	heart, I am almost always thinking of them and asking for the Blsesings of the Blessed Beauty upon them all. They are the chosen people of GOD. So do not be sorry over the present troll. tiles, They are like the waves of the stormy ocean, The waves shall soon cease to rise and again calmness shall Ile be noticed, Trust in GOB and feel comfortable,

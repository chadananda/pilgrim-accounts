##  Letter from Haifa

Dear Uncle Frank and Aunt Louise:   

Will drop you a line as there seems nothing else to do at present. We are all well and enjoying the visit. ‘Abdu’l-Bahß comes over to lunch every day at the house he has hired for the American Pilgrims. At night we have our dinner with him in his house. We arrived in Haifa on Christmas Day. I went around the shore, nine miles to ‘Akká on New Year’s Day, visited the Tomb of Bahß’u’llßh and had dinner with a druggist in ‘Akká — a wonderful New Year’s dinner. ‘Abdu’l-Bahß has just bought a car. I am taking him out for a drive nearly every day until Fugeta, the Japanese can learn to run it. I gave him the first ride in it, up to the Tomb of the Bßb last Sunday. I put my arm around Hyder Alee, the old Bahß’φ as it is hard for him to sit up alone.   

Have been up on top of Mount Carmel. Our house is at the foot of the mountains, just below the Tomb of the Bßb. I am quite familiar with Haifa now. Go down town every day, and drive outside with ‘Abdu’l-Bahß. His house is just across the street from ours. And up above, the houses for the Persian Pilgrims. They have just built a new garage on ‘Abdu’l-Bahß’s grounds.   

Yesterday we attended the wedding of MírzáMaḥmúd, and after the ceremony I drove ‘Abdu’l-Bahß and two Jewish Rabbis to the Jewish quarters.‘Akká is certainly a very interesting place. Centuries old. The same stones that Christ walked on. I was out on the Nazareth and Tiberius road yesterday. Jeffrey and I expect to go to Jerusalem soon. We take the train one day in the morning, get there about noon, stay over night and come back again the next morning. I hope to start back before long. Want to get back to Ethel and baby. I have an idea he will have another conference with me and then let me go. He has made a good many things clear to all of us. He asked me today if I didn’t wish to have a saddle horse and ride with Jeffrey. I gave Him your letters and they were translated for Him immediately.   

I will wind this letter up now on January 5, 1920, while on my way to Jerusalem, Jeffrey, <u>Sh</u>írázy and I. ‘Abdu’l-Bahß has given me instructions in regard to work when I return. Have had two private talks with him. He told me to go to Jerusalem, see the Holy Places, after that I can return home. Will be glad to see baby and Ethel again. With love to you all.
